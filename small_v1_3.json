Welcome to the City of Bettendorf Committee of the whole meeting today is Tuesday, March 5, 2024 at 06:30 p.m. we did not have our committee the whole meeting yesterday. We moved to today. And it looks to be a very short agenda. So welcome everybody. We're glad that you're here. Are there any operational items any council member would like to discuss at this point in time? Those of you on Zoom, anything? No, sir. All right, how about consent agenda items? Let's take a look at our consent agenda. Anything on consent any council member would like to discuss? Maybe ask a question about it this time? Yes, Jerry. Thank you. Your honor, I had some questions on item r and they were answered before the meeting on items o and p. I've got similar questions. Since we're now splitting that the platting into multiple sections, are we still okay as far as fire protection? Since they're only going to be doing one street at a time instead of the whole subdivision? I assume we are, but I figured I'd ask the question. The chief can probably respond. Yeah. Yes, sir. We have our pre construction meetings and we're designing that. I know. With Mister Schmidt. So we will have access. It may not be a paved road, but it'll be a good gravel base. And if you want to get into more details, Mister Schmidt, we'll be able to give you that information. Okay. As long as we've taken care of public safety. We are. I'm scored away. Thank you. Yep. Any other questions or thoughts about any item on consent? How about those of you on Zoom? Anything? No, sir. All right. I'd like to entertain a motion that all items on the consent agenda remain there for consideration this evening. So moved. Second. All those in favor? Aye. Aye. Any opposed? All right. We will take up our consent agenda at our second meeting today. I have no items to add for council today. Does anybody on council have an item to be added? No, your honor. All right, we have our agenda for a 07:00 meeting. At this time I'd like to entertain a motion to adjourn the committee. Hold. So moved. Second. We stand adjourned. Good work. We will see you in 28 minutes. Welcome to this meeting. Today is Tuesday, March 5, 2024 at 07:00 p.m. michelle, would you please call the roll? Edamson. Here. Brown. Here. Jagger. Here. Naaman. Here. Sexer. Here. Baden. Here. Palczinski. Thank you all for being here. Now, if you could all please rise, remove any caps or headdresses you may have and join us in the pledge of allegiance, which will be followed by an invocation given by Bettendorf police chaplain and outreach pastor for mighty Fortress Community Church, Pastor Alex Sierra. Please remain standing for the invocation. Justice for all. Pastor Alex thank you for having me, mayor. It's a privilege to be here. Dear Father in heaven, as this council begins their meeting, I would ask that you would find favor with this council and that you would give them the wisdom and guidance needed for this meeting tonight. Those that are here to express their concerns help them with facing the difficult decisions that might arise during this meeting. I would ask that both the council and the citizens, that they be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to anger. We ask, Lord, blessings on our municipal city workers as they deal with the concerns from the public, as well as our firefighters and police officers who are on the front lines in keeping our citizens safe. Bless our citizens here in Bedendorf, our businesses, schools, churches of all faiths, and all who visit this great city, and we ask you all these things from our heavenly Father. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thanks, Pastor Alex. Appreciate your leadership in our community. It's always nice to see you. All right, we have two proclamations this evening. And for the first proclamation, which is National Kidney Awareness Month and World Kidney Day, we'd like to welcome Jonathan Napolitino, community outreach manager for National Kidney foundation serving Iowa. He won't be here tonight unless he is on and I don't see him, but I'll deliver that proclamation. And then we have a proclamation for Rivermont Collegiate Day.

This is a change from previous years, where we always restriped our streets and pavement symbol markings in the spring.

Because we've noticed over the. You know, over the course of the summer, a lot of those pavement markings and reflectivity decrease. So then by doing it twice, we anticipate better safety in our corridors. Any questions for Brian before we move to the public hearing? Anybody on zoom? Any questions? Okay, pipe up for me if you have something. Grab my attention. I know you're there, but I might forget on something. All right. Michelle, did we publish notice of this public hearing? Yes, we did, your honor. And I do have affidavit of publication. Did we receive any written correspondence with regard to the same. No, we did not. All right, let's open the hearing on our 2024 pavement markings program as described by our director of public works, Brian Schmidt. Anybody wish to be heard on this item? All right, we'll close the public hearing and move to the resolution. Council member sexer, please. Thank you, your honor. I have a resolution approving the plans, specification and form of contract for the 2024 pavement markings program. I move approval of the resolution. Second, any discussion on this resolution hearing? None. Michelle, would you please call the roll? Sexer? Aye. Baden? Aye. Pelczinski? Aye. Adamson? Aye. Brown, aye. Jagger? Aye. Naaman? Aye. All right, we have unanimously approved the pavement markings program as outlined. We move to another public hearing on something that's almost as self explanatory. Brian, tell us about what we do in this program called street resurfacing. Thank you, your honor. This program is an annual program, as you stated, where we go in and mill off the existing asphalt of existing streets, fix any underlining pavement and sub base issues that we see after we mill it, and then place a new layer of hot mix asphalt over the top of it. But this also includes adjusting the handicap ramps adjacent to the street as well, and part of our budgeting process, part of our capital improvement program that we've all reviewed a few times. Yes, sir. All right, any questions for Brian on the resurfacing program hearing? None. Michelle, did we publish notice of this public hearing? Yes, we did, your honor. And I do have affidavit of publication. Did we receive any written correspondence with regards? No, we did not. All right, let's open the public hearing on the street resurfacing program. Anybody wish to be heard on this item? Let's close that public hearing. Councilmember sexer, again, please. Thank you, your honor. I have a resolution approving the plans, specifications and form of contract for the 2024 street resurfacing program. I move approval of the resolution. Second, is there any discussion on this particular item? It was Norman. Okay. Michelle, would you please call the roll? Sexer, aye. Baden? Aye. Pelczinski, aye. Adamson? Aye. Brown, aye. Naaman? Oh, it may not have been. Maybe. Was that Nick who had that? Second, was that you, Nick? It was okay. No big deal. Yeah, but then when we heard Naaman, we're like, no, it doesn't sound like that. All right, let's move to the next public hearing. This is with regard to a 2024 intake repair program, Mister schmidt. Thank you, your honor. Obviously, it's construction season with all these public hearings that you're seeing. Yes, sir. This is just an annual program, once again, where we go in and remove and replace existing catch basins that are identified to be troubling from staff inspections just shortly after winter, where we go in and repair the existing structures. Thank you. Any questions for Mister Schmidt? Michelle, did we publish a notice of this public hearing? Yes, we did, your honor. And I do have affidavit of publication. Did we receive any written correspondence with regard to the same. No, we did not. Let's open the public hearing on the 2024 intake repair program. Anybody here wish to be heard on this item? All right, we'll close that, the public hearing and move to council member baden. Thank you, your honor. I have a resolution approving plan specifications and form of contract for the 2024 intake repair program. I move approval of the resolution. Second. Perfect. That way we can pick one in house. Any discussion here? Michelle, would you please call the roll? Sexer. Aye. Baden. Here. Kalchinski. Hi. Adamson? Aye. Brown? Aye. Jagger? Aye. Naaman. Aye. All right, all of those construction programs have unanimously been approved. We will now move to a public hearing for a designation of forest cover at 8822 Wells Ferry Road to qualify as a tax exemption. I think I've seen this each and every year I've been mayor, so that's.

Thank you. We have the next six items relate to three requests for tax exemption for natural, conservation and wildlife areas. It's under Iowa code 427.1. It's essentially land that is not used for economic gain. It must be at least two acres in size. All three of these requests have been ones that the city has approved in the past. We have a policy on the issue, and these do comply with that policy as the council has approved in previous years. The process generally is that the application is made to the county, correct? The county is the body that ultimately approves this. But being in the city limits, the city also needs to approve it. The application is forwarded to the city. It's already been certified as eligible for the exemption by the soil conservation district. So that's essentially how the process works. Once the city approves it, or if the city approves it. It will be forwarded to the county for their ultimate disposition of the matter. But again, 8822 Wells Ferry, 3000 Barcelona and 14 and 15 and then 4340 Tanglewood Road have all been previously granted the exemption. And we can take questions on any of them. But that's the overall process for how this works. Does anybody have questions on these? Any one of the three? You got it. I do have questions. Go right ahead. You bet.

Just for my edification, being that I did hear them last year, are our requirements different than the counties or do we mirror what they expect as well? Yeah, we mirror what the county expects. It's really. I mean, this is relating to the city's property taxes and so it has to be approved by the city as well as the county. But the soil conservation district first looks at the property, makes sure that it's not used for economic gain, that it's the appropriate size, that it fits the appropriate category. There are different categories, be it forest cover, rivers and streams, open prairie. So it fits. So we do look at it. We look at the same legal standard, but we do have a policy as well that is in keeping with what the county does. Okay, thank you. Any other questions before we start our public hearings and resolutions? Okay, Michelle, did we publish notice of the forest cover application public hearing for 88 22 wells Ferry Road?

Good evening and welcome to the plan and zone commission for May 15, 2024. We are a recommending body appointed by the mayor and city council to look at site plans, zoning requests, land use and such. We see a few folks in the audience tonight, so at the appropriate time I will recognize the audience and ask if you have any comments to provide them at the podium at my left and your right back there. We would love to hear from you. And with that, Craig. Sorry, Taylor, we will begin. Thank you, chairman. First, three cases on our agenda tonight are public hearings related to adoption of either plans or ordinance changes. So I'll briefly present on those case 2423-2424 and 24 34. These are ordinances adopting the updated comprehensive plan, adopting the updated downtown master plan, and also a zoning ordinance amendment relating to our zoning compatibility table, which is required to be updated because we're updating the conference plan. So we'll start with the conference of plan. We've held many work sessions. We've initiated we've had numerous presentations, engaged in multiple work sessions, convened with multiple groups, school groups, et cetera, and hosted an open house last November. Comments and feedback on bettendorsvision for 2045 the planning horizon for this comp plan update as a result of the result of these efforts, the staff is ready to recommend adoption of this plan. We do have a copy online for viewing. A big part of that update, I'll remind you, is this update future land use map for you? There are updates to text and demographics, some of the recommended actions to achieve the overreaching goals of the comp plan, but this is a big part of it. Staff has worked very hard, worked on it since the end of 2022, and now we are in May of 2024 to begin that adoption process. So that's the first ordinance adoption of that conference plan. The second is our downtown master plan. Shive Hattery and City of Bettendorf staff completed updates to the downtown master plan mid 2023. The plan is now just being recommended for official adoption for the purposes of alignment with the comprehensive plan. Copy is also online for viewing that main. This is really the main page that aligns that future land use map, which is located in the comprehensive plan. But the same future land use map is shown in the downtown master plan. So both of these plans are, you know, envision the whole city in this, and then the downtown master plan, the whole downtown area. And of course, we have our downtown overlay district, which is shown in blue. And we have a downtown Smid district area which is shown in yellow. But this alignment is a very big improvement of what we had before. So this is being brought before you. Staff is recommending adoption of it as well. And lastly, the updating of the zoning compatibility table. This table is located in the preamble of our zoning code. This is really what staff and the commissioner would look as one part of a, under request for rezoning would look for to see if the future land use map, what the requested zoning district for that rezoning is compatible on that future land use map. Currently the, as mentioned in many previous meetings, but I will just readdress it. We changed the names of our land use designations. So for instance, urban low intensity is now neighborhood light, urban media intensity is now mixed, transitional, et cetera. There was also the addition of conservation subdivision and really service commercial. Is that mid is a new, like middle commercial. We already had neighborhood commercial, which will still be the same. It only allow, it recommends only allowing very light commercials, which is c one zoning right now. But you can see the walkover of the names as shown before you, and then the actual compatibility table as shown. So when looking, we have that eight part test under a rezoning. This is one of the first parts. I think it's number two or number one. Is the zoning district compatible, consistent with the comprehensive plan future land use map. And this is what a way to look at that. We still have our dcas. Those are shown so developed. So that is an option like a form based district. But the euclidean districts are shown in the right column and those are primarily almost the same as shown in our current code. We had to update with the new conservation subdivision service commercial and then add euclidean districts for that.

All right, thank you, Taylor. Appreciate it. Any questions? At this point, I'll just make a comment. I know you and the rest of the staff had done an extraordinary amount of work getting us to this stage, and we appreciate all that work and effort. We've participated in a little bit of it, but you guys have really been carrying the load. And much appreciated to all of you. So, big job. Yeah. All right. If there's no comment there now, I would ask, is there proof of publication for case 240 two three? The updated comprehensive plan? Yes. Okay, then I will open the hearing for case 240 two three and offer the audience any opportunity to comment on this case. Okay, no comment from the audience. I will close the public hearing. Any discussion or comments from commission? No. All right, then we will go to roll call for motion. Oh, sorry. Motion. I need a motion for my roll call. Yes. May I have a motion, please, mister chairman, I'll make a motion to approve case number 240 two three, the adoption of the ordinance for the comprehensive plan. Thank you. I'll second. Okay, we have a motion and a second to approve case 240 two three, subject to the staff recommendations. Roll call on the motion, please. Kepler. Yes. Yes. Satterfield. Yes. Stoltenberg. Yes. Wendland. Yes. Okay, recommended for approval. All right. Do we have proof of publication? Lisa, for case 240 two four, updated downtown master plan? Yes. Okay, thank you. I will open the hearing for case 240 two four and ask if there's any public comment regarding this case. Seeing none, I will close the public hearing for case 240 two four. Any discussion or questions by the commission or staff? Mister chairman? I'm going to recuse myself from this vote. Okay, noted. Thank you. All right, need a motion then, mister chairman?

I will then open the public hearing for case 24/7 any public comment on this case? Seeing none, I will close the public hearing for case 240 three four discussions and questions or comments by commission or staff? No. Did we want to address at all the transition that we have? I guess we've kind of talked about that, yeah. So I can comment real quick during our work session, leave one of the new, as mentioned, neighborhood commercials. Existing future land use designation. Right now that land use designation on our compatibility table allows c one. So that's remaining the addition. We also have community commercial, which allows c one, c two, c three, and r five. Staff has proposed the new land use designation of our service commercial, which is mostly located on our intersections and then moves into mixed, transitional, or even residential, some component of residential farther away from those intersections that it contains c one, c two.

All right, can we have a roll call on the motion, please? Kapler. Yes. Cole Carney. Yes. Satterfield. Yes. Stoltenberg. Yes. Wendland. Yes. All right, good. Thank you. All right, that would take us to the next case. Thank you, chairman. Our next case is case 23 34. This is a final plat submission named James Young Edition little background the applicant is James Young, current resident and owner of the parcel. Highlighted this plat was submitted in December for a review to December 23 Plain zoning commission meeting. A staff report was published and the applicant, based on the contents and the recommendation in that staff report for denial, was deferred by the applicant. This is thus a resubmittal of a plat. The plat proposes splitting a single family lot with one which contains one existing single family home into two lot single family subdivision. The new lot would be for a future single family home on the south side of the property. Zoning is r1 single family resident district. Surrounding area is also r one single family residence district, except there is a multifamily pud to the northwest, but it's not accessible to this area just off of Kimberly Road. A little history the shape of the current boundaries of the lot in question that's being subdivided were changed. We have a Plata survey. The lot two of the Georgia Nancy coin first edition was recently developed with a single family home and their access is from Kimberly Ridge Road. They also contained an access easement on the rear of their property, which they no longer, which became redundant. So via applied a survey, they did a boundary line adjustment and deeded that rear portion to the lot in question. This created the private drive, which is accesses 1211 Kimberley Ridge Road and 1123. There's only two lots that are served by private drive. This is important because we only per our code, allow up to three lots residential lots to be served by a private drive. Anything more would require the construction of a city street. So just a little background there. The 2023 plat, I'll call it, proposed a lot to the northeast of a new lot to the northeast, which kind of was accessible by the private drive but did not contain it. Staff recommend denial of the plat for the multiple reasons specified in that report, including that burdens on the surrounding neighborhood that outweighed the interest of the defender developer and the future purchase of the property. The lot configuration, which did not meet the depth to width ratio of three to one and disorderly development based off mostly based off of number one, but inconsistent with the comprehensive plan. The applicant chose to defer their submission and review to plan zoning and have resubmitted a new plat, which differs greatly my opinion. The 2024 putt situates the new lot to the south on the south. Property line contains actually three lots. One lot is an out lot, undevelopable for open for green space and contains some photography. But the developable area is situated east and west, is roughly 83ft wide which is meets is above the minimum for the r1 district and is in 17,000 sqft, which is also above the minimum of 10,000 sqft for the r1 district. So all this plat does meet all bulk zoning standards required for r one lot, including lot size and lot shape. I will note that a portion of that 17,000 does contain an easement, so really isn't developable. But if you take the remainder, the easement contains 6000 that you still have almost a 12,000 square foot lot which is above our minimum. The applicant has submitted a sanitary sewer plan showing the lot can be served with installation of ladder line connection to sewer access on Kimberly Road. So this is just that sewer plan profile. All that would be contained within the owner's property and also right away this also shows an aerial overlay. You can see how the plat aligns or just overlays with the aerial and where the ease where the driveway would be situated. Driveway on the proposed lot one which contains the existing house. They are proposing to vacate any easement on there which really doesn't serve a purpose. The property to the east, their access is gained through an existing easement, a separate existing easement, and then the lot too would retain that easement from the private drive.

After publication of the staff report last week on the 10th, staff has received public input regarding this proposal from neighbors. This input has been forwarded to the commission. Two main points were brought forward that staff was unaware of. These topics include stormwater and some of the basically the maintenance and agreement of that private drive, currently 1023, which is directly south of the proposed subdivision, experiences excessive runoff during rain events. Given the topography and location of the new lot, it is unclear how a future single family home would affect existing conditions. This would be the only review other than a building permit post approval of any as far as planning goes, of a stormwater really we do have our erosion control inspector and they would acquire erosion plants during construction. But given this new information, staff is recommending either postponing or this case. It's for adequate time to investigate any stormwater potential. Stormwater there might not be, but given the timing issues also the second issue brought to bear is the private drive. The proposed new lot would require access from that private drive which is inherent, but a new agrees a new agreement or an easement would need to be in place for this to occur. So currently the house to the north east where my cursor is proposed, lot one and a portion of the southern lot which doesn't use the access, doesn't use the easement for their access, but they do own or they do have to pay for a portion of it, are part of an agreement and that, that was brought to bear. How does, how are they, what's forcing them to terms on that agreement? I will cite, we have held this condition on other cases just to produce an agreement not arbitrated before. So that is being recommended as well for more time for staff to investigate that and possibly a condition for future recommendation. Staff did produce a memo that was distributed to the commission today regarding the same things I just spoke to and we're not aware of those issues. Given the new information, staff is now recommending the commission postponer table a recommendation of case 23 34 to give staff adequate time to investigate the issues and report back to the commission. And I can take any questions. All right, thank you, Taylor. Appreciate it. Questions and comments from the commission with regard to this case, please. Sounds like we need to wait until we have more information. It does. It does. Looking at it, the recommendation is that the applicant, applicant's engineer and the city investigate potential impacts of the stormwater. We saw some pictures there trying to recommend or the plat to the city council and then resolve the access agreement between the relevant parties. I guess the other comments are observations from the commission, and I'll open it up so that we can capture at this point any comment from anyone who may have come in regard to this case to the audience. So is there anyone in the audience with regard to this case that would like to provide comment at this time? Yes, Sir Benjamin Baher from Townsend Engineering on behalf of the landowner. So there was a question in regards to that easement for the roadway access in 1948 is when that easement was first established between three property owners there. And then when Nancy George and Nancy Coyne's first edition came in, that easement was further expanded upon. And lots two and three of that edition shared each a third of the cost, and the other third is borne by this Jim Young, currently, who's the landowner. So it was shared by the three and then. And that easement, when Jim Young purchased from lot two of coins, first edition, along with that, he purchased the easement and the maintenance like he took over the maintenance of it. So currently, today, Jim Young pays two thirds of that maintenance agreement, and that is recorded on document 20 1730 57 eight, and it conveys it to Jim Young. And then with this subdivision, him getting two lots, he will then divide it out. So lot one and two of this edition will each have a third, and then that other one in the north east corner will have the other third. So that's how the maintenance agreement will work. It'll be, the three parties using the driveway will utilize the driveway. It's slightly confusing because there's, like I said, it goes back to 1948 on the, on the documents on that. But that original driveway did go all the way south to Kimberly Road through the, I think it's Florence's live in that house right now. But it went all the way south. That right away with that little cul de sac did not exist in 1948. So I guess that's how the easements will be taken care of. Jim Young has two thirds right today, and the other third is owned by that right there where Taylor's highlighting right now. And it'll get divided as far as the drainage issue is concerned. I looked at that as soon as I was made aware of it. That picture that was shown by Taylor where the standing water is there. Yeah. That area is a flat area. We looked at putting a house, and that's going to be right where that proposed house would be if you, I put on a, like a 20,000 square, no, not 2000 square foot house.

You can have drainage swales on both sides, and then the drainage from this area generally flows south and west. In r1 district, which this is, you have a seven and a half foot setback. So on the south side, there's plenty, plenty of room for a drainage swale there to not impact the landowner to the south. If you were to have an exposed foundation on that side. And I think that's all I got. All right. Appreciate the insight. Yep. Thank you. Anyone else in the audience with regard to this matter? Nope. All right, we'll come back to the commission. Well, I appreciate the input that we just got, but I feel like we still need to give city staff the opportunity to discuss this further. So I would make a motion that if we table case 230 three four. Yeah. Just to clarify, if we table it, then we have to have a motion to take it off the table. So I would prefer a motion to postpone until the next regularly scheduled meeting in June. Whenever, whatever the date is in June, then I will adopt, adapt my motion. Very adaptable. Thank you. I'm very adaptable to postpone case 230 three four to the June meeting. Can I ask a quick question before you do this. We haven't voted, but. Yeah, sure, sure. Go ahead, Chris. I just got a quick question here. This guy came out of nowhere. Hi, Chris Townsend with Townsend Engineering. I'm just curious, is there a timeframe that citizens can come forward with this kind of information? I mean, we have deadlines where we have to come through, and our clients are relying on us to get things through. And then when they get tabled like this, the last second, literally at 03:00 we got word of this and had answers for it. Now, the people that brought this forward, I don't see anybody, which seems strange to me. And I'm just wondering, is there a timeline where they have to, you know, they get noticed different things and. Just kind of curious. Cause I think we provided a pretty good explanation and, you know, I'm just trying to protect my client here. Cause every minute counts for everybody, you know. And I'm just asking just so that he knows we're doing our job. Yeah, I appreciate that. Mister Townsend. You know, the time for the public is at these meetings. There's a balancing test that a lot of these interests get taken into consideration. The public can interact with its government in any number of ways, including emails that we got today. And then it's up to this body to make their decision. I think there's a motion in a second for the. The motion to postpone it. They're not under the same deadlines as an applicant would be, so there is a distinction there, but they're interacting, I think, the way that they're able to. I think the short version is it hit too late to digest it all and make sure we're doing the right thing from the city standpoint, in order to provide the commission a recommendation to proceed. So we just need a little more time to do that. That's my perspective on it. So, yeah, want to keep it rolling, but need adequate time to review it. So. All right, we had a motion in a second. Who was our second? We need a second. 2nd. Okay, we have a motion and a second to postpone. Case 230, three, four. As recommended by staff. All those in favor say aye. Aye. The opposed? Aye. Okay. All right. Motion carries for recommended to postpone. All right, next case, please. Hello, Greg. We have a case 240 three one. It's hope he's second edition. And we are already have seen this as an iteration as the first edition. This is going to be gaussian investments of Iowa is asking for a replant of this into townhouse and single family homes. The land use is split between urban medium intensity and then urban low intensity, and the predominant two land uses tend to be the only thing surrounding the entirety of the subdivision. You do have some urban medium intensity to the south, and then the remaining area around it is urban low intensity, which does permit the three reals designation for the zoning, the surrounding zoning. Three reals here for the entirety of the proposed first half of this subdivision. Two reals to the north, where the church and the school are proposed. Everything else around here is a one go to the first site plan and what originally had been presented was one detention area that has changed now to two detention areas and additional areas of infrastructure and the easements necessary to support them have been added. These lots here, lots 23 through 28 have also transitioned into other uses from what had been in the first edition.

Three reals here for the entirety of the proposed first half of this subdivision. Two reals to the north, where the church and the school are proposed. Everything else around here is a one go to the first site plan and what originally had been presented was one detention area that has changed now to two detention areas and additional areas of infrastructure and the easements necessary to support them have been added. These lots here, lots 23 through 28 have also transitioned into other uses from what had been in the first edition. The second edition now has added, as you can see, the two detention outlets and a variety more of the drainage easements necessary for the water to get through. And then there's also other engineering that has taken place here. Big changes occurred over here, though, where lots 23 through 28 now have come. A different grouping of lots where we have eleven lots now, where we had six priorities. These are all now going to be townhouses when before they were a combination of one, two family dwelling here, and then single families straddling either side. As a result of that, we are going to see a different setback. Buffer yard required here, 35ft with berm facing Hopewell. The buffer yard here is 50ft without the Bermuda due to the nature of the structures involved being townhouses. Still, the concept plan, as it had been issued through the rezoning process, has stated essentially that this is permitted because it follows that plan as it had been originally permitted. Single family housing that was over here was not originally part of that, it was originally townhouses. So it follows that out. Lot C is still the reserve area right here where there is a second phase. Site plans will be required for each one of these townhouse lots. Utility connections for water and gas will come from the north from Hopewell Avenue. Electrical will come from the east along Criswell. For the utilities. The access coming from Hopewell Avenue, Woody Creek Lane is stubbed to the south and eventually past what will be the second phase of outlaw C further to the south, connecting to additional subdivisions. Drive is here and it connects to Faceway, which will be part of a pattern here which will the entirety of the subdivision. No connectivity is allowed for any of the lots that are facing Criswell to Criswell street. An extra 17ft has been taken for dedication to right of way for cruise well street improvements. And then there will be turnarounds at each end of the street structure. For this first phase to enable emergency vehicles and sanitation vehicles to maneuver, 545 sidewalks will be placed throughout the entirety of the interior. There will also be one placed along Hopewell, as their recreational trail is already further north. Criswell street will not have a sidewalk placed along it at this time. Stormwater detention will be accommodated with these detention basins as shown here. There will be a water quality element also added. Staff in reviewing this proposal would recommend approval with the two conditions. That a site development plan is required for all lots proposed to contain three or more joined residential units as well. That the second phase of this project will contain gravity sewer, which will be required, and that any portion of that remaining in outlaw sea to be developed will have a minimum cover of 5ft for that sanitary sewer from the top of pipe. Staff in reviewing these conditions and the proposal would make a recommendation for approval, I would ask, are there any questions? All right, thank you, Greg. Appreciate it. Mark. Anything since publication or presentation? No, nothing different. I would just note that your conditions in the staff report are the actual conditions. The site plan requirement is just a requirement of code. I think Greg's mentioning it just to kind of emphasize that point. But the actual condition relative to the second phase for the sewer abilities is the actual condition. Yeah, and I saw that on there. So there. Is there any. Can you give me a little more insight? So how is the current development or phase being. Is that. Let me give you an update on that, mister. Yeah. So this parcel, Greg, can you go back to your aerial map that might show some of the adjoining. Thank you. Right now, there is no sanitary gravity. Sanitary sewer, that's a immediately adjacent, except for on the north side of Hopewell. The kicker with that is that this whole property drains south. So you're bucking grade to be able to serve. Fighting gravity. You're fighting gravity. That's exactly what you're doing. So the first phase, they can still make gravity work. However, the second phase, when we started looking into their full engineering, they were coming up short on depth and some of the homes were going to have to have ejector pumps, which was not something we wanted for new construction. So we're working with the developer. They're most likely going to be considering either a lift station that would allow them to just gravity, flow that all to the south and then pump back up to the north. It would cover the entire edition, or we did meet with both the developer and the property owner to the west just this week, trying to see if there's a way that we can, between both parties, work out an easement to provide gravity sanitary sewer coming through that parcel, there is a large transmission main that runs through the west side of that property. So it's there. It just is not immediately adjacent. It's about 1500ft away, unfortunately. And there are no eastmans through that property right now. And there may be some sewer coming to the east eventually, depending on what happens with development, but not in the. So the sewer to the east, Criswell, is a ridge.

So all of our sewers that are in place now are only sized to handle up to Criswell, and then anything east of there, again, would only be sized to handle back up to Criswell heading west. Okay. So we wouldn't be able to ever cross over between the two. All right, thank you. Sheds a little light on that. All right, other questions and comments by commission. Yes, Brent, I have one more question. By moving forward with this first phase and not having total solution for the second phase, are we somehow painting somebody in a corner or creating an issue that somewhere down the line can't be resolved? No. So the condition probably should have been, maybe reword it a little better. At this point, with conversations we've had with the developer, it's going to be one of those two options to move forward with this. It would not make any sense to do just the first edition heading north and then pump right back through it from a financial standpoint. So it's either going to be gravity sewer to the west for the whole edition, or the lift station for the entire edition. Okay. Yeah, that's our fault. We probably should have rewarded that a little better. I understand. Thank you. I got one quick question. Are there other parts of the property that aren't developed yet that are going to have the same issue that the city's kind of working to get ahead of? Not with their parcel. The property to the south will need that exact same gravity sewer coming from the west. It would solve a couple of issues. That's why the. That I kind of involved myself with that discussion with the property owners, hoping that we can come to some type of an arrangement. Sure. Makes sense. I'm fairly certain we covered this, but if you could give us a little reminder on how the sidewalks will work on Criswell eventually, and who's going to pick up that tab. Sure. So when Criswell. So we actually will be starting our kind of long awaited project out there in about two weeks. So that's gonna be a full depth reclamation. It's a maintenance project, but it's gonna turn Criswell at least into an asphalt driving surface for the time being, as opposed to the old seal coat surfaces out there. We've got a eight to $11 million bill to try to convert that to a urban section. At that point, we would, the city would install sidewalks and most likely a trail along there, but that is not currently funded yet. A lot of dynamics, one being the price, two being the fact that it's still currently half city, half county. So our east annexation, if and when that happens, will play a lot into that timing. But some of the previously developed lots that do have frontages, I think I'd have to check with Jeremy, our building manager. But generally speaking, a bond is required to be posted when the sidewalk can't be physically installed, since they are required by code to do so. So is that the case here? Yep, that would be the case on those e slots. But again, the city will take care of that when that urban reconstruction happens. Thank you. Others in the commission, a couple questions. Do we have a rough side plan of what's phase two or something that I'm not sure if he has? The preliminary poll, I didn't have it added. I mean, even if it's preliminary. Just my second part of the question was the temporary turnarounds. Are they also places for holding snow piles? Yeah. So that we require that for any dead end in a subdivision, we just build them out of rock. It's basically just a way for exactly that. Our snowplows to turn around, our garbage trucks to turn around, and emergency services if they ever had to. Basically, the second edition, the east loop is going to loop back and tie into the west. And then there is a stub that ties to the south as well. Okay. It does connect further south? Yes. This will connect all the way through eventually to Woody Creek Lane, I believe is the name of it, but it ultimately runs all the way to old Hunter woods. So there's several subdivisions that it will connect through. Got it, thanks. Anyone else? No? Anyone in the audience with regard to this case? No. All right, we'll come back to the commission. Mister chairman, I move that we approve case number 240 three one, subject to the staff recommendations. Second? Okay, thank you. We have a motion and a second to approve case 240 three one subject to staff recommendations. All those in favor say aye. Opposed? Same sign.

This is the area right here. Woodland Drive comes up, and then Mayor Ford will be joined here. Heilworth Avenue will come through here, and then you have a means of entry and exit through this area. It's proposed by Adam Seitz of Winfield West LLC. This is a development for single family housing. Again, we see this mixture of urban low intensity and urban medium intensity land uses, and the surrounding land uses primarily of urban low intensity. And then this urban medium intensity and urban low intensity permit. The current status of zoning being three reals for this rectangular piece that is yet to be developed. The surrounding zoning is a one to the east and then two reals to the north, and then r three for the surrounding area. This was originally preliminarily cladded at one time to have 25 lots, single family housing. That has changed, and now we have on 6.21 acres, single family units, but I should say it was 25 lots. Now it's reduced to 20 single family lots. Utilities are present along Ioworth Avenue and Merfield Drive. Sanitary sewer service will come from the north side on Ioworth Avenue, and then Mirfield Drive on the east side. Then water will be on the west side of Muirfield, and then on the south side of Isleworth Avenue. An access. Again, Muirfield coming through, as I mentioned earlier. And then there's the circulation. Connectivity will be completed at this point. Once this gets done, once we have the completion of the utilities and all of the paving in place, there will be five foot wide sidewalks along all the interior streets of the subdivision. Storm water will be taken care of through out lot w right here, which was planted in the first edition. And this is approximately where we're looking right now for this addition. And that will all be conveyed to this out lot. There will be a water quality element as well. Staff looks at this as meeting comprehensive plan goal d, this project, and providing housing options and reinvesting in neighborhoods. As part of the comprehensive plan, we make recommendation for approval. I would ask, are there any questions? Okay, thank you, Greg. Appreciate it. Mark, anything to add from staff? No. Okay. Questions and comments from the commission, please. Pretty straightforward. Anyone in the audience with regard to this matter? Nope. All right, we'll come back to the commission. Mister Chairman, I'll move for approval 24. Final plat. Subject to staff recommendations. Second? Okay, thank you. We have a motion and a second to approve case 24 0033, Wyndham west, fourth edition. Final plat. All those in favor say aye. Opposed? Okay. Motion carries to approve a recommendation of approval. 240 three three. Okay, next case. Next case, mister chairman, is 240 three six. It is 43835 Avenue and it is a site development plan which does change somewhat of the original design layout for the building. This area is one of the last remaining lots that does face along this stretch of 53rd Avenue that is yet to be developed as lot three. Shops of the woodlands proposed by Ryan Windmiller of windmiller design build Aspen homes. The area is surrounded pretty much by urban medium intensity land use, except to the north, where it is urban low intensity. And that facilitates the zoning of this site as c one. It also corresponds with what we're trying to do is attract and retain business and industry with this zoning. Class c one is to the west, to the east and south to the southeast. We have five reals zoning in the area of the village of the Woodlands. And then we also have three reals to the north, which is mixed residence district. A lot of record here is shown as lot three. There is a plat note restricting access coming in from Ontario Drive only. There is no direct access out to 53rd or Slate Creek. Creek coming on in. This is the original site plan, which showed five units. And this is the restaurant area. So there are five retail units and a restaurant area, and that was approved in 2022. We come up here with the current proposal. We have an area which approximately 3500 sqft staffed at an evaluation. It's about 3589 usable area that is for. For servicing customers. So we consider it to fall within the confines of the c one zoning district. The retail now is 2487 sqft, which was produced from the original plan of 6857. For retail. The total building is now 7446, not the previous 9857. Look at the elevations. There will be two means of entry to the restaurant, and then we have the remainder for retail access and thoroughfare plan lot three.

The retail now is 2487 sqft, which was produced from the original plan of 6857. For retail. The total building is now 7446, not the previous 9857. Look at the elevations. There will be two means of entry to the restaurant, and then we have the remainder for retail access and thoroughfare plan lot three.

It's just a matter of connecting to the structure and then water, gas and electrical mainly come from the area right here, along with the sanitary. In terms of the pedestrian access trail, there will be a six foot wide proposed sidewalk going here, 5ft for the perimeter here. And we already have the recreational trail to the north. We did some calculations. There is a difference between what was in the table showing capacity in the restaurant versus what the actual production was for parking spaces. The restaurant itself will require 46 spaces. The retail portion of this area is going to require 1369 spaces are provided, 59 are what are required. Landscaping is the same as it was before. 21 tree factors spread throughout the area on this parcel without, of course, any encroachment into the easement areas. We want to keep those free and clear and the lighting is what it was before and we want that required as being downcast. We add the condition that for this area right here, which is this outdoor area, since there will be serving of alcohol in that outdoor area, that there will be a special use permit that will be required from the board of adjustment prior to city council consideration of this site plan. Given that requirement, staff recommends approval with the conditions that are listed here regarding tree planning, evaluation of further tenants, regarding parking and the right of use, and also the special permit for outdoor alcohol service. I would ask, are there any questions? All right, thank you, Greg. I appreciate it. Mark, anything to add, Mister chairman? I would like to recuse. Okay, thank you. You did receive an email before today's meeting. Sorry for the late publication there, but we did want to share with you some of the changes that went on and some of the analysis that staff did. So the building is actually a little bit smaller, slightly smaller and slightly moved on the lot. If you look at that, was it 7500 square foot building? The amount dedicated to restaurant is actually bigger than 3500 sqft. Our neighborhood commercial restaurants are limited. 3500. Petitioner asked, was that a net measurement or a gross measurement? Fair question. So we asked, staff determined that is actually a net measurement based on our past practice and interpretation of code. So that 3500 sqft is net. So we're netting out or excluding non customer areas both inside and outside the restaurant. So if you have things like chillers and walk in freezers and those things where customers aren't served, we're not holding you that against you. And so the zoning determination letter I did place at your desk or Taylor placed at your desk so you can see that? So that's how we get to that 3500 sqft number. And that's keeping with past practice. It just kind of moralizes it. That's something we'll probably address in code going forward with our zoning code update. Now we have our comp plan basically done. So I want you to be aware of that. And that's how we get to that, you know, 3500 area. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate that. The other thing, too is one, we can look at this and see that the outdoor patio area is approximately 350 sqft. So it's not going to be used year round. It's going to be used partially. So that's another factor I think that we're looking at, too. So that does not figure into the calculation. It does, it does, but it's not. Again, you're only. You're very. There's a very small difference. But if you remove that, then you're way below that 3500 area. But that other area that's out on the patio is not part of the calculation. It's like the outdoor kitchen, the outdoor kitchen prep area, because they do have the kind of an area where they will be handling the food behind the scenes. Not for customer access, not included. Questions and comments otherwise, questions and comments by the commission. Anyone in the audience with regard? Yes, sir. Good evening. I'm here to let you know. Can you tell us who you are so we capture them? Sorry. My name is Ron Roman and I live in Slate Creek Drive. I live just two doors down from the existing property. Okay, great. Thank you.

Okay, great. Thank you. I would like to let you know that this proposal, by reducing the parking, will only exaggerate an existing problem that you're probably not aware of. And I have brought some proof for that. Oak Grove tavern, right now, as we sit here, is parking on the street. They don't have enough parking up there available and they're adjacent to where this parking lot's going to be. And it's going to be also accessible from Oak Grove Tavern, which means the ten or 15 cars I have a picture of just an hour ago that are parking on the street right now will be going into this lot. Are they parked on Ontario? Just to clarify. I have a picture of it, yes. Okay, thanks. I also have a picture of. Yeah, we have a. I'm sorry, I can't hear him. He's going to grab some pictures and we have a screen however you want. Okay, great. You can make your comments, but I'll make sure they can see those pictures. These are on the. The first ones are on stout. And then the last one today, which you might want to show first. It's this one. Yep. We can put them on projector here. That'd be great. Thank you. Fiit still see it real quick? Yeah. Not keep the day job right. Somebody else can do this. You can go ahead, sir. We will just get this going. Okay, so this is picture number one. This shows looking southeast from Ontario on the east side of the entrance. This is just south of the bank. And the circled item is the no parking zone that is signed. That is there. Now, as you can see, there's parking on both sides of that street. This is on a Saturday afternoon, about 03:00. This happens on the weekend consistently. I can't say every weekend, but it happens often enough where it's probably 50% of the time, especially in the summer months. Okay. Number two, if you want to show that up, this is the bank's lot. Those are not bank visitors and they're not employees cars. So the overflow of the parking lot on the east side, our area entrance, goes into the bank. As I said, there's not enough parking already for the existing businesses there. Okay, if you can move to number three, please. Again, there's the sign. This shows the south side of the west road into our addition. And you can see that road from both sides from the east. And the west side is pretty well filled that particular Saturday. Okay. And if you could go to the fourth one, as I said, this shows an hour ago. Oak Grove Tavern is in the background there, and there's at least 15 cars already parked on the, on the street. Now, on a Saturday, Friday afternoon and a Saturday, both sides are filled. They're not paying any attention to the no parking. Now, to me, common sense dictates that there's not enough parking right now for the businesses there. I don't know how you're going to compound that with another 200 plus capacity building. And I'm not anti growth. I think we do need a restaurant out there, but I don't think the size of that and the lack of parking is going to help the situation. It's only going to make it worse. In addition to that, the entranceway is going to require you post no parking signs on that, too, or there'll be parking in the entrance only, allowing one car going each way. Only one minor thing, and I know the, the utilities run behind that property, but every other property that faces 53rd that has a building there has landscaping on the south side of those buildings. And I wish you could figure out some way of doing something about blocking the back of that business. Is there any questions? Questions from the commission for run? May I introduce these as evidence for you? Absolutely. Yes, please. And then lastly, if in fact this does go through those signs, that signage for those existing sites need to be changed for that side completely of the street. The parking signs. Parking. No parking on the south side completely because they'll leave this. Leave the one spot where the sign is and they'll park all around. Can you guys clarify the parking situation and the street parking dynamics? What's permitted in that out there? He's correct. Parking is only permitted on the north side. Yep. So we have an enforcement opportunity. Yeah, we just have to pass that along to the police. Unfortunately, nothing we're in any control of here. Is there any commission for run? I can tell you the. The reasoning behind the original no parking. So when Ontario was built, there was parking lot on both sides. There were no parking restrictions. When stouts was going in, I believe it was when they had just opened. We were getting complaints that the businesses were directing their employees to park on the street to try to preserve every on site parking space. And I wonder if that same thing is happening at Oak Grove, if they're directing employees to be parking there at all times. But again, parking is allowed. But the double sided is something we're going to have to pass along to. And that's along the entire south side of. Yep, it's the entire road. Okay. And then can we address to the current count and the code so we can clarify that where we're at with. I think you said 69 spaces were required. Is the. Is the retail use identified for the remainder of the building? So we know what the count will be. 59. 59 total. 59 square footage. 13 spaces were for the commercial retail and then 46 for the interior for the restaurant. So they are. They are over parked? They're appropriately parked. So they are parked enough for their use that they're proposing. Yeah. Chris Townsend with Townsend Engineering. And things have changed here, here and there with this. And so what we've got now is for the restaurant, which is 5000 sqft, we don't use the 3500. We actually use the 5000. So it's one per hundred square feet. So it's required 50 plus the patio. We. I think we had 465 sqft. So we had five. So it's 55 total for the restaurant. The retail is 2500, which is one per 200. So we needed 13 more. So I think that was 68.

And we actually provided 71, which we had some more. So Greg was right. I think we were about ten over but we had some parallel spaces that just the city didn't like and I truthfully we didn't like them that much either. But we were just trying to get every single space, you know. So we're, so we're three more than we should be. And I know that, I mean I go here every once in a while. I hate to admit it but it's easier to park on Ontario. So a lot of times people park there and I know it's full a lot of times Ron, no question. But they'll park there when their space is available. It's just easier. You'll see pickup trucks and things that are just big. So I mean that's kind of another part of the problem I think, or part of the reason I guess we'll have you come back up to the mic again Ron, if you wanted to have more. But what I'm hearing just for repeating I guess is that per the current Bettendorf code they have met the parking requirements for the 5000 square foot restaurant and 3500 square foot of usable space. Yep. Either way the code requirements been met which is one of our challenges here. The code's been met but the reality is something different from what you're experiencing out there. And unfortunately we can't over require based on what the code is. I don't know if I'm saying that the best way but yeah, well if there's people that are breaking the law by parking illegally, that's not the petitioner's in this case, the petitioner's not decided. If you go there and park illegally, the petitioner's not, that's not the petitioner's fault. That's not relevant to this case. This case is accurately parked and providing a parking plan that is plus what the city's requiring. So I'm a little nervous about weighing that one user's discretion against this issues. But I would strongly encourage enforcement of the current no parking zone which may push and shove, the car's got to go somewhere, there's a lot of activity. And when sprouts first came in there it was super busy. Not so busy anymore, but it was a real parking issue. And some, you know, flash, everybody goes and it tapers down to some kind of normal. But the bottom, bottom line is this user petitioner is meeting the current parking codes. But from a neighbor standpoint I think enforcement is reasonable from your standpoint for the no parking areas for sure. But did you want to add more to that Ron, could I just add a brief history? Yeah, sure. Okay. I moved back to this area when I graduated from University of Iowa with a finance degree and after being in the service in 1972. So I've lived here for 52 years. I moved from the other side of the river because of the other problems over there. Good call. And I'm very happy to be over here. And I moved to Bettendorf five years ago, and I'm very happy to be in Bettendorf. The one thing I've noticed and observed, by the way, I was also on the transportation committee for the chamber of the Bettanorf chamber for six years, and I chaired that for two years. But one thing I have noticed is that quite frequently there are real estate, real estate agents and adjusters or assessors that have been on both councils in the history, and they have seem to have a spot on the positive things for the developers as opposed to watching out for the neighborhoods. And I've noticed the extreme example I can give you is Jersey Ridge Grill. I lived in that neighborhood for 42 years, if you're familiar with that. I'm surprised somebody hasn't been killed on that street. That was a strip mall converted to a bar, and the capacity never should have had that small of a parking lot. People crossed that street at night after drinking all evening in the dark. There was no lights at half a block south of 53rd, and most of the cars were parking over in the bank and the church. So that's an extreme example of how the code does not apply on a logical basis. And I would encourage you to maybe take another look at this, because the situation in our home area right now is going to be. Because the code qualifies it. It's going to be a disaster. And there's no, stopping the parking on one side isn't going to help it. You'd have to stop it on both sides. Can you address the legal perspective on that? Mister Chairman, could I ask just for clarification? Sure. Greg did some research under the cross easements, and I'm wondering, by actually adding another parking lot into the subdivision and if there are cross easements so that that parking lot could serve other, other users, you know, offsetting hours and such. Greg, did you look into that? I mean, I think we've, throughout this development, that was the concept that, you know, the part parking was shared evenly amongst all of these lots and has been staged in, in that manner. And certainly we want the developer to abide by that. And if there needs to be any, you know, type of agreement as such that there is that sharing, then we want to require that. I imagine that this body could in case that is not the case.

And certainly we want the developer to abide by that. And if there needs to be any, you know, type of agreement as such that there is that sharing, then we want to require that. I imagine that this body could in case that is not the case. But I believe when this was all laid out initially and this had been site planned out for some time, all these lots were going to be sharing, parking and overlapping based on the times of different uses that were there. Because not everything here is a restaurant or a bar. There's a lot of these offices that are commingled here and their hours operation. Once 05:00 shows up, they're not there anymore. Hey, thanks. I don't know if the engineers for the applicant have access to those cross easements, if they exist. Think we could work that out if that was a concern. But this proposed development meets current code requirements. So notwithstanding the reality of what's on the ground out there, this body, Ron, has to look at the constraints of what's provided in the code. And this development meets that code requirement. It begs the question of awareness and making sure that, hey, if we ended up with a whole basket full of these all over town, we might be, from a code standpoint, reevaluating. Need to reevaluate our parking ratios. Just like handicap for the aging population and different things, dynamics change. But today, from this board's perspective, and I really appreciate your input and the pictures, it's very graphic to look at and say, hey, here's reality and what we're dealing with. But from this side of the desk, we have the code that we have to abide by and that's our barometer. So I appreciate that. But from our perspective, and I don't know if you'd add any other. I think you said it very well, Roy. These are hard cases and, you know, but we do have to look at what our law is. And currently our law RC code says that this is adequately parked. There's always, you know, the opportunity to look at the legislative side of it and to determine whether those ratios should change or should be different for particular types of uses. But at this point, we are applying this application to our law, sitting as a judge, essentially, and this seems to meet the law. The other dynamic, and I probably want to state it just for the record, is the reality on the ground is that the landlord, the owner of the property, needs to make sure that the building space that he's renting is functional for the user. And if it gets too under parked out there and people can't get their customers in their business, there's going to be tenants that are going to be really unhappy. So there needs to be, to your point, cross easements. Whatever. A practical solution or it's not going to work from a landlord and tenant standpoint, it's got to work for everybody. We would encourage the owner, developer, landlord to do what he can to make everybody accommodated out there, but it is meeting the code. So any other comments? Last call on this case. Okay, come back to the commission for a motion, mister chairman, I'll move for approval of case 240 three six plan subject to staff recommendations. Okay, thank you. Second, we have a motion and a second to approve case 240 three six, lot three, shops of the Woodlands, first edition. All those in favor say aye. Opposed? Okay. Motion to recommend approval for 232-4036 thanks. Okay, our next case, mister chairman, is 240 three eight and it is 25 70. Middle Road is a site development plan for change of use and also for the parking space increase. What we have is this location here, nearby Spruce Hills Drive right here and then 23rd street and then Middle Road. Applicant is Matt Milligan of Switch Mulligan, LLC. Currently community commercial land use. It's a c two zoning. As you can see, there are a variety of different land uses with the church here, public, semi public, urban, medium intensity, where the bank is, and then the majority of his community, commercial throughout. We have park ground to the south and then we have urban low intensity, r1 zoned area also to the south. And you can see that here, r1 throughout the park area. C one for the church and some other buildings in the lending institution. The bank is c two and this area predominantly is c two and c one throughout. Most of this juncture here with Spruce Hills and Middle Road. And then there's a delineation between Middle Row and north of that tends to be more commercial. South tends to be like in a recreational or in a single family residence zoned area. Ewing Bettendor, first edition.

The updated version shows an additional 14 parking spaces with two aisles of parking at the dumpster location here and then the means of entry. We see that the parking totals have gone up. Golf simulation area shall basically occupy this portion here of the building. The remainder is anticipated maybe for a type of medical service here and then these two areas here occupied potentially maybe by a restaurant. The current structure follows the footprint with that was seen in the plan as approved in 2023. You'll have a patio for outdoor service here and this area here is going to be occupied by x Golf which is a golf simulation. Limited impact in terms of recreational use special use permits were obtained for this outdoor patio and also a bar in the internal portion of the ex golf site. The northwest corners already provides a mean of access for the thoroughfare essentially coming in. You'll find that from Middle Road, this access allows access to the adjoining area here on lot three through what was something that was guaranteed from the bank site, northwest corners previously. Go to the building footprint and it remains the same as before. All utilities are in the same area. In terms of connection, that is really not what is at issue here. Go to the pedestrian trail access and this access is already in place. The sidewalk is there is a recreational trail to the south and also one along Spruce Hills Drive. Calculations were conducted as part of the special use permit acquisition. They were broken down so that 55 parking spaces are required for ex golf which is going in. It leaves 22 other spaces for other uses for this building. In the future, staff at such time will evaluate and we require that the developer indicate to us those other uses as they may go in so that we can look at the use as to whether or not is a use by right special use or whether it's permitted and then how much parking will be required for those particular uses. Landscape plan is as it was before. There was not enough parking space added to require more tree factors. There are a total of eleven tree factors. Seven for the area adjoining and then four for the interior for the vehicular use area. As part of this, an agreement between the party to the north on lot one and then lot three, placing that landscaping here to the north boundary to act as a buffer. It was part of the arrangement that was made on the prior site development plan. The lighting plan is going to remain the same and I put in the hours of operation here Monday through Thursday 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. friday 10:00 a.m. to midnight and then Saturday 08:00 a.m. to 01:00 a.m. sunday and then on Sundays 08:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. special use permit conditions that were added were the verification again of the parking based on who's leasing his tenants. And that has to be evaluated by city staff before we issue any changes or any permitting for the building. And then approval of the revised site plan is being brought here forward to this body, but is required to be approved by city council in order to activate any of the aspects of the outdoor patio liquor service and then also the bar for the ex golf. And we have the conditions that are listed here in the report. Staff is making a recommendation or approval based on the conditions that are listed here and the approval of the special use permits. I would ask, are there any questions? Thank you, Greg. Appreciate it. Mark, anything to add from your perspective? Okay, questions or comments from the commission regarding this case? I have several questions. Can you. We talked about drive through in the first iteration of this. Is that still in the plan? That's what's proposed up here. And there's actually an opening on the side of the building for that, I believe. And in the staff report said that the owner developer is willing to work with the property owners to the north on creating a buffer. Has there been any discussion, any meetings? Is that going to take place? Do we know any more about that? I think there was one meeting that was already held and it is something that in terms of that buffering, whether it could be evergreens. And I think one of the suggestions that we made as staff is that the tree factor should be met out in that way. We have not revised our landscape ordinance at this point. So that means you're doubling those tree factors by planting evergreens. You're establishing an even more large number of trees that could be placed there and they'd be year round as a buffer being evergreens. And we brought that up as staff. If it needs to be brought up as a condition of some sort placed in maybe by this body to guarantee that there is some type of agreement arranged maybe to prior to issuing building permits or something, that's up to this body and also staff.

Has there been any discussion, any meetings? Is that going to take place? Do we know any more about that? I think there was one meeting that was already held and it is something that in terms of that buffering, whether it could be evergreens. And I think one of the suggestions that we made as staff is that the tree factor should be met out in that way. We have not revised our landscape ordinance at this point. So that means you're doubling those tree factors by planting evergreens. You're establishing an even more large number of trees that could be placed there and they'd be year round as a buffer being evergreens. And we brought that up as staff. If it needs to be brought up as a condition of some sort placed in maybe by this body to guarantee that there is some type of agreement arranged maybe to prior to issuing building permits or something, that's up to this body and also staff. Well, I suppose if the developer is willing to do it, it's to benefit the property owners to the north. And if they don't want to have that, then that's their decision. Yeah, if I can weigh in, Mister chairman, I think there's been discussion on that issue. Also discussion on because the same property owner is the property that they're looking to, and they may have already purchased property from. So I don't know if those issues have been combined in their minds and they're kind of working through that. The developer is here and present at the podium. Maybe it will shed some light on these issues for us. Okay, let me ask a couple more questions and then we can just cover all the bases. So I'm looking at the additional parking and now we have a pretty steady traffic flow around this building. Will these businesses have a rear entry to the east or is the main entrance to the west? The main entrance will be to the west and there's like an area, you know, back way out, as it were, a single door for each of these. I mean, I'm just thinking about people parking and then having to navigate on foot to get to the front of the building while people are driving. And then the other question is, we've talked a lot about parking tonight. We've talked about cross easements. Has there been discussion with the about across easement with the bank to accommodate any overflow that might occur? That's all questions, good ones. I hit all this. I think that may have been discussed earlier, and I think trying to contain the parking on this lot of record is the outcome primarily of that discussion that was mentioned at the board of adjustment case, that that was something that was contemplated. I don't know the result of that discussion, but that was mentioned by the developer also. The developer is also a property owner to an adjacent caddy corner property that is yet to be developed as well. Would there be additional parking there or not? I don't know. Something they can share with us. Did you want to help us with those questions while you're up there? And then we may have some more for you. Please. Yes, very good. So I'm Matthew Mulligan, 3415 Stoneman in Dubuque, Iowa. I appreciate your efforts on this, this evening. Three questions here. I'll walk through those. So trees on the north side. We have talked about that with the northern property owners. I would say it's not settled in stone in what it will be. I have, in fact built a berm, so that does exist. I know there were some emails that went back and forth on trees and things like that, but the trees that were there originally, those were on my property, so they came down. I had shared with them. I'm happy to put trees up and I expect to do that, frankly. I want the division as well. I'm going to be building residential to the north on the adjacent property that was just mentioned. So. Yep, right there. So some trees will go up, probably evergreens, things of that nature. So that's. That's number one. Rear entry. Rear entry. They will not be public entry points on the rear. There will be doors on the rear. But traditionally that's been for employees. So I have a building very similar to this with the rear entry as well. And it's just employee use only in garbage and stuff like that. So there are sidewalks around it. And that's where. Yep. So that's where we'll see use there cross easements. So the biggest thing here that really I strive for is to park it right. You don't. We don't need to over park for a variety of reasons. We don't need to create a ton of asphalt space for unnecessary reasons. So park it just right. We did talk to the church. There was some interest at least on the front end, really, once it got to elder conversations, that's kind of where it stopped. So we have been in conversations with the bank next door. So the bank is a partner in this project as well. So I suspect that if needed, once we determine who those tenants will be, we'll be having those conversations with staff to identify how many spots we need to get. Originally there was actually an insurance company that was going to go in that building and so hence the reason that it was parked in as such. But that changed. So I think I talked about the three questions that came up. Again, I just want to highlight ex golf coming in. This is an out of state organization that's looking to invest in Bettendorf. So I'm happy to see that. Obviously I'm from out of town as well, looking to invest in Bettendorf. So I appreciate all of your services and everybody that's here today. It's been a very good experience. Why don't I stop there and see if I've addressed everything that in fact came up, answered my questions. I've got one. While we've got you up there, just looking at the site plan in the northeast corner. We got that. Can we pull that up, Greg? Yeah. Could you just wave your little one hand over the northeast corner right where we come around right. Just a little further south. Right in there.

Could you just wave your little one hand over the northeast corner right where we come around right. Just a little further south. Right in there. So we've got two lanes coming up and it looks like it narrows down quite a bit. My question ultimately is, do we have a queue issue with cars that would queue up for the drive through right there, backing up and blocking rotation around the building? Kind of right where that pinch point is with that island that comes out. It doesn't look like we've got two lanes. So if you've got four or five cars queued up to that window, would they be blocking your ability to rotate around the building? So I don't know. I would have to analyze that particular situation right there. What I will say is the drive thru may actually. So these drive thrus are always funny because it's dependent on the tenant that you wind up putting in there. Actually, the group that is considering units one and two, which are on the north side, they actually will not use a drive thru. And so I'm really hoping to get to at least an initial consensus on that so I can make a good decision on whether or not I put it in or not. I will analyze that. What I typically design for is a 14 car Q. So I will analyze that. That's a good question. I'll analyze that with staff as well. If it's atomic coffee, which is a local coffee with queues down the block and around the corner and somewhere in a davenport, it's an issue. If it's a dry cleaner that has five cars a day, it's a non issue. But to me, it's just where you're going. It's all dependent on your tenant and your volume. If you've got a high volume drive through and rotation, and then you throw in a little snow and other things. 42 foot, you know, suv backing out there. Anyway, that's. That was my observation. That's fair. The tenant looking at it is pizza in nature. So atomic pizza, maybe, but not atomic coffee. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Any other question? Yeah, I do have a question. So the sidewalk that is shown around, especially on the backside, you did mention that there they were mostly for the staff and they would be using the back door. But in an event that someone, some customer parks down there, looks like the sidewalk is disconnected to the front somewhat. Maybe. That's what I'm seeing on the drawing, but. Well, in the southwest corner, it doesn't quite connect. So is that something that can be adjusted south? So, yeah. Where the hash mark. Great patio is. If you can zoom in. I see what they're saying. Okay, that's fair. Thank you. I'll take a look at that. Thank you. It's just there is the patio in the south end of the building. It is, yeah. So the patio is. So you were just talking about a 350 square foot patio. This one's quite a bit smaller. It's about 200 ish. So it's. It's going to be like four. Four top tables. Will there be any kind of buffer or screening. Between that and the drive through or the drive around, there'll be a railing. Yeah, a railing. Yeah. So to your point, then they'd have to step off the sidewalk, get onto the pavement, and step back on. Well, unless he hasn't said the patio's gated to me, I could just walk into the patio and around to enter into the building. But if the white space that's shown is landscape, then that's. That question's correct. But I don't know that the intent is the patio is actually gated on both ends. We don't require that. Just people think because there's outdoor alcohol service, there's gates on all four sizes. We actually don't require that. Something that's actually done here also, mister chairman, if you look at this dimension here, the drive is 21 and a half feet wide right here. So that there could be potentially some accommodation in there. But there is a significant width. Yeah. And I just, when I'm looking at the one, I see the 18.38 a little north of that, Greg. And that going out to that spot. And then from that end of that space to the west. Go west. Yeah. This right here is the parking width. Yeah, but go. Yeah, go to. Go to the end of the 18.38. And is there then 21 and a half feet from there to that curving. Going up? No, going up and then coming around. Yeah. This goes up straight there. Well, yeah, there's 21 and a half there. But when you get the island sticks out farther. And I think the. It looks like this. Straight up, 21 and a half. What you're seeing is the delineation between the asphalt and the concrete curb and gutter. So where the outline for the island gets a little thicker, that's still. That's pavement. What they're actually showing is there's three lines. So it's the back curb, the front of curb, and then concrete match, but it's not. And what's that? Square, 16 by 16. What is that? Oh, I see. That's the transformer. Yeah. Electric air. Oh, makes sense. Wow. Okay, well, that addresses the one question. Any other one else with the commission? Oh, we've got Matt up there.

I think we are really looking for a no right turn because traffic could exit out, and likely we'll exit out. Many people use our private drive to go out of that area now because it's very congested. When you try and turn out of Northwest bank parking lot onto Middle Road, especially when I came down here today, I had to wait several minutes. So I think that is a concern. As John mentioned, we do have a signed purchase agreement that was executed today. The buyer has 45 days for due diligence and then 30 days to close. So we're not quite there, but we are confident that will go through. And as John mentions, and we're very grateful, there has been a berm, dirt berm that's been constructed there on our property where those trees came down. But I, like John, would like to see that landscape plan so we understand what's going in there to kind of help buffer that. And again, if we could get that no right turn sign out of that parking lot, I think that would be a huge help because we are private drive. And if people overflow and park on both sides, such as what happens on any event, 4 July in particular, emergency vehicles won't be able to get down our private drive to get back. And obviously, we are a 55 and better community, and so chances of needing something there in an emergency fashion are. You're the only one that's 35 back there. Huh? So anyway, we're just concerned, and we would like some assurances that we know what that landscape plan is and that we're willing to, they're willing to perhaps help us avoid traffic traveling on our private drive. So thank you. All right. Thank you. Appreciate it. Tim, may I ask a question? Sure. Is it clearly marked that that's a private drive and there's no through traffic? It is very clearly marked. And also, the speed limit's only 10 miles an hour there. And we regularly see I would like to say it's just high schoolers, but yesterday it was a school bus. And so lots of traffic comes and goes through that private drive. And so nice new concrete there. But when you get to happy Joe drive. Where it becomes city. There's going to need to be some attention there. Which I assume they're waiting until after the rest of the construction happens. Because as Matt mentions, there is some additional residential construction. That's going to be going on between our building and northwest banks. Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks, Matt. Any input on the turn sign or not? Very quickly, a no right turn is fine. As has been mentioned, I do own the other lot, too, which will be residential. So I think it's prudent. Okay, that's. That is there as well. So no issues for me. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Appreciate it. Anyone else in the audience or the commission? Last call. All right, back to the commission. I would just add that if we're serious about the no right hand turn, then you need to make it so it doesn't. So you can't turn right. Or you've got to pop over a curb to turn right. I mean, if we're serious about that, give a little lip there or something to. Usually it's right in right out that we're constructing. This is kind of the opposite of that for these sweets. The other solution is one that I'm sure nobody really wants. But speed bumps. That usually takes care of people coming that way if they've got to go over a few speed bumps. Yeah. Does make it difficult to plug snow, however. Yes, it does. I'm not going to disagree with you on that. The other side of the sword. Yep. All right, back to the commission. Mister chairman, I move that we approve case number 240 three eight, subject to staff recommendations. I'll second. All right. Thank you. We have a motion and a second to approve case 240 three eight, subject to staff recommendations. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Aye. Any opposed? Okay. 23 or 240 three eight is recommended for approval. All right. I think that was it, wasn't it? Do we have a staff update? We don't. Wow. We have a motion to adjourn last month. All right. Or adjourn. Thank you, everybody.

All right, now if you could all please rise, remove any caps or headdresses you may have and join us in the pledge of allegiance, which will be followed by an invocation given by Bettendorf police and Bettanor fire chaplain and pastor of Asbury United Methodist Church, Pastor Tom Carver. I pledge allegiance to the black of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Please remain standing for our invocation. Pastor Tom. Pastor, shall we pray? Loving God, we thank you for a new season that is beginning. Signs of new life and hope and a positive future in a community with parks and riverfronts and trails in which we can enjoy your creation. And then when it gets hot, we'll have a future pool and water park to enjoy it. And then when it gets cold, a new skating so we can enjoy that, too. We ask that the blessings we enjoy would be a motivation for us to share in our blessings with others. We pray for our mayor, our council members of our city, our city workers, our police force and firefighters, and all of our citizens that together we might make this a premier city. That is a sign of hope and good things to come for everyone. We pray this in the name of God. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Pastor Tom. Thank you also for your continued work in our community.

Welcome to the city of betten north. Committee of the whole meeting today is, excuse me, Tuesday, February 20, 2024, at 06:00 we did not have a committee the whole meeting yesterday, as our city departments were closed, or many of them anyway. Certainly administration for the presidency holiday. So we are here this evening. We do have an operational item to appear at seven and eight on the regular agenda moving forward this evening. After that, we welcome our assistant city attorney, Jeff Ryder, and our city attorney, Chris Curran. Gentlemen, tell us about this excess alley right of way. Yes. Good evening, your honor and members of council. Thanks for your time tonight. Fairly docile item on the agenda this evening, but one we wanted to cover to give you a little bit of a scope on what's going on here. So as the IDOT acquired a lot of parcels for the construction of the new I 74 bridge, they go through a vacation process on the back end whenever they no longer need some of those remnant parcels. And tonight we are going to talk about one of those in question. As part of their disposal process, the city has the opportunity to acquire parcels when they feel it necessary or appropriate for development. In this case, the city does not necessarily have an interest in acquiring this parcel in question. It would be notated here as the yellow box, if you will. That's roughly the parcel that is going to be vacated by the DoT. There is an interested party, however, and we want to assist that party in acquiring that parcel for the sake of a future commercial development downtown. Specifically, this yellow parcel does not have much interest to the developer, but he certainly wants to protect his interest as he looks to develop the parcels to the north and to the east. So what you're looking at here on Grant street, you'll see the on ramp up to the new I 74 bridge just to the west side of this block we're talking about. Parcels one through six on here are all owned by the same owner. There's a number of different llcs in which they operate under, but it's all the same owner who has that block under control. And we understand from the Department of transportation that all of the land south of the alley, with the exception of this small parcel that you see in yellow, will be retained by the Department of Transportation. And likely the city of Bettener will enter into a maintenance agreement as we anticipate having a monument sign on the corner in the future. In order for the DOT to work directly with this commercial property owner to the north of the alley, the parcel has to be abutting or contiguous with the parcels that he owns by virtue of the fact that there's an alley or public right of way, splitting the middle, if you will. It's not potentially perceived as contiguous or abutting. So they have suggested that we vacate this alley to that property owner and they would then determine that to be an abutting or contiguous parcel. We have worked with engineering and public works. We have no infrastructure in this alley and as it is a dead end that will never punch through again, we don't have any need for this in the future, so we are comfortable with the disposal. Councilor Curran and myself also worked with a potential property owner to the south of the alley to gauge their interest in potentially wanting some of the alley segment as well. And they expressed no interest as the dot is likely going to retain their land in perpetuity. So the only likely owner of anything south of the alley, north of the alley is the singular property owner who is going to develop it all commercially. So therefore we're going to retain an easement for sewer and stormwater if we ever need to. But as it is, we have no use for this alley in the future. So we would dispose of this in our typical fashion, a dollar per square foot. And tonight that's up for discussion for you all to consider would be that resolution approving the vacation of this alley. So in fact, this parcel and the gold would become a budding or contiguous with the parcels to the north. And with that, your honor, I would answer any questions. Well, I don't have to look to my left this evening, so looking to my right. Gentlemen, any questions for councilor curran or assistant city administrator Reiter? Nope. All right. Seeing none. Jagger, do you have any questions? Greg? No, I'm fine, your honor. Okay, so we'll bring that to your attention as items to appear number seven and number eight. As we move forward this evening, let's take a look at consent I for that, we welcome our human resources director, Kathleen Richland. Thank you. Thank you, mayor and council.

Currently, the city works with Wellmark for health and prescription coverage and delta dental for dental coverage and ebs for vision coverage. Staff has worked with Holmes Murphy, our insurance broker, and conducted a marketplace review of other reinsurance vendors to determine the upcoming reinsurance rates for the city. Out of the vendors that were contacted to submit quotes for the upcoming reinsurance year, based on our plan design and our experience, only six responded out of twelve. Through the review, Wellmark was the lowest with an increase of approximately 9.4%. Staff has received a higher increase this past year based on the larger claims experience. It's usually cyclical and we seem to be experiencing that right now. Additional employees that we have hired, which in turn causes additional belly buttons on the plan as well. And we're at approximately 257 employees, 800 bodies that are on the plan. We have appreciated our relationship with the city that has built with Wellmark and Delta Dental and ebs and recommend working with them this upcoming year. And I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have. Questions for Kathleen? No questions. Then I'd like to entertain a motion that this remain on tonight's agenda. It's consent item. Aye. Second, all those in favor? Any opposed? All right, we will take that up on our consent agenda as item I moving forward. Any remaining consent agenda, items that any particular council member would like to discuss at this time, mister Jagger? No, your honor. Thank you. Anyone else? All right, anybody have any items to be added? I do not. Come see me tomorrow and we'll see how it goes. Maybe we'll have something to be added by then. My resignation. No, I'm just kidding. Come on. All right, let's move into our discussion of the fiscal year 24 25. Budget Finance director Jason Schad is here and so is our city administrator, decker plain. Gentlemen, you have the floor if you'd like to share some information with us. Thank you, your honor. Well, your honor, this is, we thought we'd just take a couple of minutes to talk about based on our work session last Saturday. Saturday before, I can't remember which one. It was Saturday before Saturday before, we had recommended to you that we consider the firefighter increases to support the safer grant over a three year period with a twelve cent increase each year for three years at then also added to that additional personnel requests that totaled $0.10 for the other positions at that time I was advocating for twenty two cents and did not consider doing it all at one time as that was raised by councilmember Jagger. With that, we thought that you should see the impact of that 46 cent idea because that idea is kind of resonating certainly with me now and I think with Jason primarily so that we can guarantee the delivery of the seven firefighters pursuant what we agreed to do when we got the safer grant. Six. Well, six. We include seven in the budget, your honor, but for our purposes I'm talking about seven now. And we got the grant and we said that when we applied for the grant that we would obligate ourselves to the funding of those firefighters ad infinitum. And given the, I would say, uncertainty with the state legislature after councilmember Jacob brought this up. I have no idea what they're going to do to us over the next two seasons that might jeopardize the second twelve and the third, that 36th cents that we talked about. So I've become an advocate of considering the $0.36 as a minimum, and I add the dime to that so that it's a 46 cm proposition. I understand the desire of councilmember Jagger was that we would then try to stand down on any levy increase in year two or year three, and I think we would certainly do our best to make that happen. We obviously can't guarantee what comes at us, but I think we understand the proposition as it was placed forward to us in that regard. So we felt that we should at least show you what $0.46 did, because that was not necessarily in the matrix of what we had provided to you on Saturday morning. We showed you the proposition of no increase, the proposition of twelve cent increase, the proposition of a 17 cent increase, and the proposition of a 22 cent increase, which I was advocating for at that time. So we had Jason kind of put together the 46 cent and its impact. We wanted to show you that we did not necessarily think that you had to come to any conclusion tonight. You certainly might want to have some discussion about that. I think we would like to get to some certainty or some finality by next month or at next Mondays special meeting that we have on the 26th. I think that's when I would like to call the question. I'm not sure we have to make that decision even then, but I think we have to give direction to publish. And remember that once we publish, we can always publish high and come in low, but we can't publish low and come in high. Once you make that determination, if, say $0.46 is the number that you wanted to land on, you can publish 46 and land on 22. You can't publish 22 and come in at 46. So we have to come in with our highest number that we publish. So with that, it seems to me that with that conversation that we've already had and that seems to be", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Wellmark\",\n        \"positives\": [\"Lowest reinsurance rate for upcoming year\", \"Established relationship with the city\"],\n        \"negatives\": [\"9.4% increase in rates due to larger claims experience\"],\n        \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n        \"comment\": \"While Wellmark offers the lowest rate and has a strong existing relationship with the city, the increase in rates due to larger claims experience needs to be monitored.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Delta Dental\",\n        \"positives\": [\"Established relationship with the city\"],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"hold\",\n        \"comment\": \"Delta Dental has a strong existing relationship with the city, making it a reliable choice.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"ebs\",\n        \"positives\": [\"Established relationship with the city\"],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"hold\",\n        \"comment\": \"EBS has a strong existing relationship with the city, making it a reliable choice.\"\n    }\n]", "esg_v1": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Wellmark\",\n        \"observations\": [\n            {\n                \"observation\": \"The city currently works with Wellmark for health and prescription coverage.

So with that, it seems to me that with that conversation that we've already had and that seems to be ongoing, it makes really no sense not to publish at 46, so that you then have the opportunity, even if it's a unanimous 22 or something else, you give yourself that option. Correct. You certainly may get the push back at 46, but that might be part of the process that we need to try to determine where we want to land. Agreed. Okay, so, Jason, so that was the setup, if you will. So I wanted Jason to kind of show what he was thinking and what he's been able to generate. And I have just a couple of slides to add some color to that great summary that Decker just provided. Anyone want to speak up a little bit? Greg's having, I know, some hearing issues in Florida. Okay, just as a review, we talked two Saturdays ago about the budget. 118 million across all funds. We believe it demonstrates the city's financial strength and flexibility, responds to those extraordinary decreases in taxable property value due to the rollback and other legislative property tax reductions, and then demonstrates our commitment to public safety by providing funding of those six safer grant firefighters when that grant period ends in three years. I think the reason we're talking about a levy rate increase for FY 2425 is really in response to the slide you see here. Taking together all of these state changes, including the rollback and that legislation, have really reduced the portion of assessed value that is actually taxable. It was 62% just ten years ago and now down to just under 51%. I think that alone, from FY 24 to FY 25, will eliminate $393 million of taxable value, equal to 3 million in potential property tax revenue. So I think without a change in the levy, exactly. In any other year, given a taxable property value of 58% to 62%, we're probably talking about a levy decrease. So this is really a function of that hit to taxable property. So the question is 46 now or later. As Decker said, we came to you with the proposal, excuse me, of capturing $0.36 over three years, $0.12 each year, and we've added a dime to that to cover a couple of those other positions and other rising costs throughout the budget. So we asked you to consider a budget with a 22 cent increase. The caveat to that is that it requires $0.12 in each of the next two years following. So you will get to question is just do we do it now or do we do it later? If we do the three year buildup again, we'll do $0.22 this year and twelve in each of the next two. The total levy rate for this year will be 12.87, but need to go up again at $0.12 next year. Impact on that average home that we talk about, it's valued at about 318,000. Is increase of $14 on property taxes for the full year. This is at the 22 cent level. But as Decker mentioned, this approach does risk the full funding of the firefighters if legislative action would prohibit us from necessary increases in years two and three. And that's kind of where we're hedging and he and I are kind of aligning on moving towards this 46 cent scenario. So the all at once scenario, we'll take the $0.46 right away. In this year, the total levy rate will be 1311. But again, you would get to the 1311 level over the next two years if we went with the other plan as well. The increase on that average home is now $48 for the full year. But I would throw out there that because of the reductions in taxable value on many existing homes, even at this 1311 levy rate level, the plus $0.46, about 35% of residences will pay less taxes in 24, 25 than they're paying this year. This approach does guarantee the full funding of the firefighters at the end of the safer grant. We know we can capture that today and it will supply some surplus revenue in these first three years where the grant is paying for the firefighters. It would be our suggestion that those funds be diverted to one time uses, infrastructure projects, equipment purchases, economic development activities, things that do not recur in the budget so that the funding is there at the end of the grant period for the six and now seven firefighters. Here's what the levy rates might look like. As you go across the page, you'll see Fy 2324. Our total levy rate is 12.65. In the current year. We add $0.22. It's 1287. And you can see how we've sprinkled those throughout the different levy rates. And then $0.46, we get to the 1311. Just some details on the impact on that average home. In the top section, you'll see the 22 cent scenario. In the bottom table, you'll see the 46 cent scenario and then the changes due to the rollback due to valuation. But at the end of the day, you're talking an increase of less than 1% at $0.22, or just about 2.6%. $48 a year. At the 46 cent level, commercial is a little bit different.

Here's what the levy rates might look like. As you go across the page, you'll see Fy 2324. Our total levy rate is 12.65. In the current year. We add $0.22. It's 1287. And you can see how we've sprinkled those throughout the different levy rates. And then $0.46, we get to the 1311. Just some details on the impact on that average home. In the top section, you'll see the 22 cent scenario. In the bottom table, you'll see the 46 cent scenario and then the changes due to the rollback due to valuation. But at the end of the day, you're talking an increase of less than 1% at $0.22, or just about 2.6%. $48 a year. At the 46 cent level, commercial is a little bit different. They're definitely paying a little bit higher portion of the tax this year than in previous years. But again, $0.22 here at the top, an increase of about $2,300 or 19%. $0.46 is the blue box on the bottom. That takes that level up to about $2,600 or plus 24%. And then I would just remind you, this is a chart you're all very familiar with. Our standing in the Quad Cities where property taxes are both residentially and commercially. We stand at the lowest among the Quad Cities and our neighbors. We continue to be a great value when compared to cities of our size and growth patterns across the state. And the top eight lowest costs, when you add up property taxes, user fees and things of that nature on an average home, and again, you take away our debt levy and look only at operating. We are a lien operation. If we're only looking at the taxes for operations and fees from utility funds, we are the lowest cost of those 24 cities. So I think we provide an excellent value. I don't think in either levy rate scenario you'll see a change on these charts drastically one way or another. We are one of just four cities across the state that even has the flexibility to consider a move like this. So I think that's something we should be very happy about. And I think, you know, that perhaps the stars have a line to take the big swing and move towards the 46 cent increase. I think it protects our flank from legislation that would prevent us from getting those twelve cent increases in year two and three. I think in a year where taxable property value has decreased so much, the impact of a levy rate increase like this is very minimal on a taxpayer and for many won't be an increase at all. So I just wanted to kind of inform your discussion a little bit more than we did last Saturday when that request was kind of new to us. So we've got provide some information here, and obviously I'm available to provide answers to any questions you have between now and the time that we make a final decision on the budget. That is all I have questions for Jason with this new information. Yes, Scott, thank you, your honor. Maybe Monday night would be a good time to get an answer on what types of, give us some examples, perhaps on what some one time spends might be on some surplus dollars. I mean, certainly we think engineering and things have to be done for roads. Brian, the reality of how long a CIP project has to get, I just don't know that we probably need a reminder of what types of things that might be. Right now you got 300 projects in the CIP over the next five years totaling $130 million. And we bond about ten. So that's gonna get 50. So that could be a something. I think the reality of that needs to be shared so that, you know, not saying that that is what the money would be used for, but it helps frame the decision on, you know. Cause we, I think collectively have indicated we don't really wanna sit on, you know, several, several thousand if not millions of dollars of money to just sit there's. There's a strategy here that we're trying to find a best deal for our taxpayers and for our residents and create options and opportunities for not only perhaps economic development, but aging infrastructure. I know we all drive with pride through our roads and the lack of potholes is noticed, but there is still some aging infrastructure, and perhaps that could be. Be part of, you know, the bigger picture, where it's a better bang for the buck. Thank you, your honor. Yeah, thank you. Good idea. Anybody else? Yeah, I think Nick? We spent a lot of time. Thank, your honor. We spent a lot of time talking about the firefighters. Can you refresh my memory on the other positions that would be included in this as well? Yep. So there's six firefighters hired through the safer grant. That grant period starts here in March and runs for three years. In addition to that, we have recommended the hiring of a fire marshal. Fire marshal. Wow. A fire marshal. To take on the development type work and inspection type work that's necessary. That would be a part of this funding model. There's also the recommendation for the addition of a parks directorate. Separate from kind of separating that culture and rec director into two pieces. We have an addition at the library, an outreach coordinator position at the library, and then there's two other positions that are technically already funded in the budget. The replacement of the PIO and some kind of community engagement role, and then a building maintenance technician in the public works. It also included the upgrade of three patrolmen to sergeants. Remember that we've got a very young department now. And the chief's request was to have an additional sergeant on each shift. And there's an upgrade, if you will, for that. It doesn't hire any additional officers, but it makes three patrolmen sergeants. So there would be two sergeants on each shift under a lieutenant. Thank you. I think that helps clarify and again, reassure the residents of our city that not only are the human or the safety perspective, but also there's a considerable amount of additional resources that are going to be offered to continue to keep pace with what our residents expect.

From Bettendorf. Right. Parks and everything. So I appreciate the clarification. Thank you. We've pretty much stood down for the last eight or ten years while we grew at about 18%. So that's something to keep in mind. A lot. There's a lot happening in our city. Yeah. Anybody else? Jerry? Thank you, your honor. At the same time, we could potentially keep that extra funds in our cash reserve. And right now, with interest rates high, we could generate some income from that that's another option. We can certainly analyze that. And then that cash reserve would be there if we needed it. If for some reason we lost a fire truck, we lost some other vehicles or something happened, we had a fire and the building burned down. Clearly, that would be an option as well. Clearly. And my other comment is, if we only went with $0.12, that would only guarantee that you would have two firefighters in the future. Of the six, I believe the safer grants are all or nothing program. When we, you know, last five years was the council. Pull your mic over to yourself, Troy, so Greg can hear you. Sorry about that, sir. I think the safer grant is an all or nothing type of FEMA funded grant. I remember five years ago when the council, you know, direction was to start staffing out at station four. For the last five years, and even before that, we've been applying for the safer grant, kind of knowing where we were going to end up. Once again, if we were going to hire the firemen anyway, it's nice to get a $2 million bonus going into that. So if we weren't able to fund them, I think they would go away. The funding from the safer grant would go away, is what I'm saying. That's correct, Frank. Thank your honor. I agree with what Jerry said at the beginning, because I don't think we have any idea what's going on in Des Moines to affect us. And if the commercial affects us, 500,000, 700,000, whatever it's going to be, these monies would be there for us to draw on if we had to, rather than just go out and put them into projects. Right now, I'd like to see what's going to happen in Des Moines, because they seem to be full of surprises and none of them to benefit the cities of the state. So that's my thought process. Greg, anything? Yes, your honor. Very briefly, Jason, do I understand that staff has taken upon itself to put on our webpage an opportunity for an individual property owner to find out what their property taxes are currently and would be under the various scenarios? Yeah, that's correct. We have a spot on the webpage where if you enter your home's address, you'll learn all kinds of great information about your property, including your garbage day and who your alderman is. But we've added a portion there that will compare your current year property tax bill, an estimate of that bill, and then an estimate of what that property tax bill might look like under these couple of scenarios for next fiscal year. I would just add the caveat. That it is a. It's an estimation tool at best. It is not necessarily a completely accurate depiction of what your property tax bill will look like. There's different credits and different exemptions of property that we can't account for for everyone. So it may be slightly different than what you see on your property tax bill, but it should be a very good estimation. Okay. Thank you. Jason, earlier in your presentation, you recognize the changes from the state level and the rollback and how that has affected revenue to the tune of about $3 million this year, difference over last. If we were only to raise the levy just to take care of that 3 million, understanding. You also said if we were at that revenue stream, we'd have the opportunity to reduce the levy. But tell me what $3 million on our levy might be. It'd be a tremendous amount. And I should be clear. It's not $3 million that we were collecting last year that is taken away from us this year. It's the capacity to capture $3 million without a levy rate increase. Right. That we don't have. So what is that equivalent to in a levy rate? Isn't about 125 a nickel? Yeah, you need 25 nickels. You need a buck and a quarter to a buck and a half. Right. Okay. I did the math for tomorrow. I just want to make sure my math meets your math, but maybe we don't like you doing. I ought to pull that out of the presentation and not really say that, but understandable. And you're talking about 22 or 46? Yes. Yep. Other discussion questions? All right, great. So, your honor, we wanted to just make sure that you understood that we took the liberty of taking the conversation that you had. We believe that you nodded at us that $0.22 was likely an okay number. Felt like the discussion was 22 or 46. Right. And then the 46 we really didn't explore much.

So on the website you have the current tax rate, the 22 cent consideration, and the 46 cent consideration. We added that there so that any member of the public could now see the three scenarios that you have talked about. Next Monday is the first state required public meeting that we have to have. It's not the publication. It's the first public meeting. You could make a direction for us at that point to publish at 46. We believe that that's a smart play, a smart move. Even if you don't come in at that, it seems logical that that would be the recommendation, and then we would have the date for the public hearing at the end of March. So there's time to take input and or hear from the public if anyone is surprised by it or anyone's not understanding it. Again, I think the most important point that I would like to put it you is, and the chief alluded to it, we committed when we made the application for the safer grant, that if we were received that grant, we would fund six firefighters at the rate that we talked about, we would do that over three years. If that's not available to us, I still believe our obligation exists. And so the more that I've thought about this, the more that I think it's smart to erase that doubt by doing the $0.46 or they just come out of police. It's that easy. So that for sure, for sure, you have solidified that guarantee that we made to them that we would do this, tell that part of the town that we have the services we said we were going to have at the end of that grant. So I believe that it makes logical sense why we are considering doing that. But, Jason, when would the council, in your mind, have to set that $0.46? Is that at the 3535 is really. Prior to that, I have to have all of the state forms kind of filled out and completed and submitted to the Department of Management by one day on about March 5. So you need to know. So we know. We need to know before next week. But if the direction is just to publish high. Yeah, that's enough direction for me at that point. Okay. The decision doesn't have to be made, but next week, we ought to be ready to tell you publish at this number. Exactly. That is, that's. And you've got enough flavor on council that's looking at 46. It just makes no sense to me. Unless everybody by then says 22 is the number, then why publish at 46 and create any hub. Hub that you don't need? But if we still have people thinking that you publish at the 46 and you make your decision. Correct. Okay. Okay. Anything else on that? Jeff has something, your honor. Okay, Jeff. I'm sorry, your honor. Just a quick clerical item. Councilmember jagger made the notion about having to click a number of times on our website to find the information. It's currently two clicks and then you type in your address. If it would, please, counsel, we do have the ability to place it on our homepage. There's a call out box there that would take you directly to where you could find your property tax information on your specific address. If that would be something council would desire, we can certainly do that very easily. Okay. I mean, I don't know how many people you're gonna have looking for it. If there's 5000 people looking for it, one click less might help. But if it's in the right place to be found and two people look, I don't know. I guess we don't know what we don't know. No problem. Okay. Well, if that discussion has concluded, then I'd like to entertain a motion to adjourn. Second we stand. Adjourn. Good work. We will start our meeting. Jagger? Here. Gauman. Here. Sexer? Here. Baden? Here. Palchinski? Here. Thank you all for being here. Now if you could all please rise, remove any caps or headdresses you may have and join us in the pledge of allegiance which will be followed by an invocation given by Pastor Richard Pecora of all Saints Lutheran Church. Please remain standing for the invocation. I pledge the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Pastor, your lord and heavenly Father. As winter comes to a close and spring approaches, we begin to think of all the good things, the happy things we can do in the months ahead. We think of our gardens and our trips and vacations. And so tonight here in our council, may we have a good vision of what is ahead of us. May we think of things that will improve our community. May we think of things that will help our residents do better in their daily tasks and lives. We pray all of these things through your name. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Pastor Rich. Always nice to see you, my friend. Okay, we're at public requests of council.

Refrain from outbursts like clapping or yelling. Be respectful and give us a couple minutes of your thoughts or your request. Is there anybody here who wishes to be heard on public requests of council? All right, we'll close public request of counsel and let's move to our receipt of bids for our series 20 2024 a bonds. For that, we welcome Christine Hogan, a director with Baker tilley. Thank you for making the trip. I assume from minneapolis. Thank you very much. For being here. And Jason chance, shat, I've only known you for 30 years, our finance director. Thank you both for being here. Thank you, your honor. And I will leave all the good news to Chris. Chris Hokin is here from Baker tilley. They are our financial advisors and assist us in many ways. But one of the biggest ways each year is through our bond sale, and we did that this morning at 10:00 after a lot of work prior to so. All right, Chris, take awesome. Thank you, mayor and members of the council. Again, I'm Chris Hogan from Baker Tilly, a municipal advisor to a city. And again, I'm here tonight to present the results of the city's bond sale that happened earlier today. They sold 15,615,000 general obligation bonds, series 2024 a. The proceeds to finance was various CIP improvement projects, stormwater improvements, and urban renewal projects related to the middle road, pedestrian bridge and trails. I always like to start with just a quick market update. One way of measuring the performance of tax exempt bonds is the bond buyer index, and that will measures the yield in the 20th year for a general obligation bond rated aa two. Looking back over the last four or five years in 2020 and 2021, we had saw all time low rates at that time, and that was due to the pandemic. Since then, beginning in 2022, there has been eleven rate increases by the feds for a total of five and a quarter percent rate. So it's been an interesting last couple of years for sure. And those rate increases were to help curb inflation. In 2023, we saw a bit of volatility with rates up and down, but pretty much the year ended where it started, and that's kind of where we started in 2024. So part of a bond sale, as everyone knows, going through a rating process to get the bonds rated. Historically, the city has used Moody's to get their bonds rated. We decided to take a different approach this year. We thought that perhaps looking at using standard poor switching to them was better suited for the city's methodology to recognize the characteristics specific to the city of Bettendorf and the credit quality of the city. So part of that process we had, we, I mean, city mostly hosted two s and P analysts this past summer for a site visit. Participants were the mayor, Decker Plain, Jeff Reeder, and Jason Schatt, and they put together a fantastic rating presentation. We started the day at the TBK bank sports complex where the mayor gave a welcome. We went through a presentation, we toured the sports complex, and then we spent the afternoon touring the city, which was pretty darn awesome. And Jason did a great job showing the analysts all the things going on. New developments, residential, commercial, the TBK bank, of course the bridge. What resulted from that is S and P gave an indicative rating. At the time it was aaa plus. That wasn't published, but we knew that we had aaa plus. So when we were going into this bond sale we decided to of course engage s and p. The bonds did receive a aa and just to compare that double a plus is equivalent to a aa, one of Moody's and the city is aaa two. So essentially it is, it is upgrade by a notch. So I think that was all positive that we took that approach. So back to today's results. We had the city had 16 bidders for their bonds, which is probably the highest I've seen. We found a couple other unless they go way back, but that is pretty amazing. The winning bidder was Janie Montgomery Scott and they had the lowest bid at a true interest cost of 3.4. The range between the highest and lowest was 3.449 to 3.554. So very tight with 16 bidders we estimated. Just to give an idea of perspective of where rates are, we had estimated true interest cost at 3.83 back in December. Last week we updated the rates and let Jason know. Our expectation was a 3.42 and it came in at 3.4. So really quite close. So given that great sale results, we are recommending Citi award the bonds, their general obligation bonds, series 2024 a to Janie Montgomery Scott with a true interest cost of 3.449. Any questions, decker or jason? Jason, you might want to talk about the premium. Meyer offered a re offering premium we expected back in our December estimate a premium of about 800,000. You'll recall that the bond buyers will offer a premium in order to collect a little bit higher coupon percentage than the actual interest cost that we end up paying through the bidding process. We ended up with re offering premium of about 1.6 million. So just about double what we expected. The first 800,000 we had already kind of programmed into our CIP programming. We expected that and that was part of our bond proc", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Baker Tilly\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Financial advisors assisting in many ways\",\n

We expected that and that was part of our bond proceeds to fund the projects. That 2nd $800,000 we had a. We had a couple of choices. We could actually reduce the sizing of the bond sale or we could take the funds and put them into the CIP fund to fund additional projects or into the debt service fund to fund the debt service on these bonds going forward. So we made the choice to actually take that extra premium. I think we'll probably split it up between the CIP and the debt service bond. If you looked at the debt service schedules and the actual payments, the cash payments that the city will have going forward for the life of these bonds are very, very close to what we anticipated. So really no impact on our projections going forward. I think it's a good opportunity to add a little bit of extra cushion into both of those funds. So for that reason, we decided to go ahead and take that extra 800,000. Doctor, did you have something to add? I would just add, your honor, that when we made the decision to have standard and poor's look at our rating, we felt for the last couple of years that we deserved an upgrade. We've done all the things that we felt financially, the city, for all the awards that we've received over the last 30 years. And then this year we got the Triple Crown with the additional financial presentation award, and then the budget award and the CAFR, the comprehensive annual financial report. And based on our pretty conservative cash fund balances, we felt that we were worthy of that. And it proved out. And it's all the work that you do when you are going through the budget, just like we talked about tonight, it's all the work that they do in managing the budget, and obviously, it's all the work that Jason and his team do. And then, of course, Baker Tilley, our finance advisor, and ahlers, our bond counsel. But all that work, which nobody really sees behind the scenes, has brought us to this point with an extremely favorable rate and doing all the projects that we identified in goal setting and now in the capital budget. So this is the culmination of all of that thought process and all of that work. And we're grateful that for everybody who participated and put us in this place. So, any questions? Councilmember Jagger, do you have any questions? You're muted, Greg. I think he said no. Thank you, your honor. Thank you. All right, any questions from council? Thank you for your work. We really appreciate it. Appreciate the presentation, but all the hard work of the folks in finance and our department heads, thank you all for all you do. Thank you very much for being here and the hard work that Baker Tilley does on our behalf. And thanks to Jason, your honor. Awesome. Danny Ox? Yeah, I think Jason. Okay, well, let's move to the resolution. Councilmember Norman, please. Thank you, your honor. I do have a resolution determining the bid from Janny Montgomery Scott, LLC of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to be the best and most favorable bid received and the general obligation bond series 2024 a be awarded at the final par amount as adjusted in the amount of 15,615,000. At a true interest rate of 3.4517%. And a total purchase price as adjusted in the amount of $17,215,331.01. I move approval of the resolution. Second, any discussion on the resolution. All right, Michelle, would you please call the roll? Nauman. Aye. Sexer. Aye. Baden. Aye. Palczynski. Aye. Jagger. Aye. Okay, we have unanimously passed that resolution directing the sale of those bonds. The next item on tonight's agenda is a public hearing with regard to the vacation of excess alley right of way perpendicular to 15th street and North Grant street. We had a presentation on this at our committee of the whole meeting. And I assume there are no further questions from council relative to this project since we had our opportunity just a little bit ago. Okay, michelle, did we publish notice of this public hearing? Yes, we did, your honor. And I do have affidavit of publication. Did we receive any written correspondence with regard to the same. No, we did not. All right, let's open the public hearing with regard to the access or excess alleyway perpendicular 15th street. Anybody here wish to be heard on this item?

All right, we have unanimously adopted that resolution. Councilmember kern can get that working. The next item is a public hearing regarding the Edgewood Drive reconstruction project from 19th to 21st street. And for that, we welcome our director of Public works, Brian Schmidt. Brian, tell us about this project, sir. Thank you, your honor. Let me just pull up something real quick. This is a very important project for this neighborhood. It's not only the reconstruction of Edgewood Drive between 19th and 21st street, but you can see on this map there is also a significant. A significant portion of 21st street that is going to be reconstructed, as well as 19th street. This is to facilitate not only the reconstruction of the pavement, which is going to be full width, including the driveway approaches and what have you, but this area has no storm sewer in it. And we've seen, over time, significant issues with drainage through these neighborhoods. So with this project is the addition of storm sewer, and that'll traverse all the way from west to east and then south down to down 19th street, and then there's a manhole down there at Glencourt, and then it'll traverse down to the south and east. As I mentioned, all of the driveways will be reconstructed on this project. But right now, we are anticipating the bid for this project to take place on February 27, and then it'll be awarded to the contractor on March 5. Here at city council, we do anticipate on or about April 1 our construction project to begin, and it will be broken out into three phases. However, before I get into the phasing of this project, I wanted to talk about the water main in this area, too. That IO, American Water has identified as being strained and needs some repairs due to some. The condition of the pipe, the age of it, and some leaks that have been happening in this area. So that's one of the things that we do with any of our street reconstruction projects, is that we work with the utility companies, such as mid American Energy, Iowa American Water, and tell them that we're reconstructing a particular project, and then ask them if they have an opportunity to remove and replace their assets before we actually reconstruct the street. In this case, Iowa american water is going to be coming in and doing so. We anticipate Iowa american water to start their water main project late February, early March. In advance of this, they plan on constructing on the west side of 21st street or east side of 21st street, all of. All along Edgewood and all along 19th street within these project limits. When they come in and put the water main in, they'll actually install the water main, connect it to the existing water main live by adding valves, and then pressurize it. And then once that water main is live, all of the individual water service taps to the home then would be connected live, like I said, so that there is no water service that will be cut to the residents during the construction period. When this project is constructed. I know that my staff has received some comments from some of the neighbors that are here tonight about how this phasing will go. We anticipate it being phased into three stages, starting with the section in Pink with 19th street. We're going to start moving the storms who are from the south up 19th street and. And put storms who are all in the intersection of Edgewood and 19th. Is that 21st? The pink, I think, is 21st. The blue looks like 19th, Brian. Yeah. Excuse me. And then going to the west, all down Edgewood, and then putting storms to are all at the intersection of 21st and Edgewood once that's done, they'll come in and start removing all of the pavement. It will be full width. When they do the pink section, it'll be full width. So there is going to be a time where the individual property owners will have to have parked their vehicles elsewhere because they will not access their home. We will provide golf courts when necessary due to somebody with age or medical conditions or if it becomes such problematic for the resident, we will provide golf courts, golf carts to assist them in accessing their property. Then we anticipate doing the middle of Edgewood Drive and then that south portion of 21st and then obviously the blue section after that. Questions on garbage. When this project is being constructed, we just ask that the homeowners bring their garbage can to their driveway like they normally do. My staff or the contractor will take it to a collection point to to where our solid waste team will then pick it up. We will put a sticker on their can that'll note their address and then it'll get back to the proper home. With that, I'll answer any questions you have. Questions? Yes, councilmember sexer. Thank you, your honor. How wide is the right of way on this street? The right of way is 50ft and the existing pavement is 27 foot. So will there be any sidewalk work done? There is not. There's none that exists today, but I was wondering if you were going to put it in since the rideway is adequate for it. We are not anticipating putting sidewalk into this neighborhood. Okay, thank you. Any other questions before our public hearing? Greg, do you have anything? Craig Jagger. Council member Jagger? Sorry, I'm looking at Greg. Is the name okay?

Michelle, did we publish notice for the public hearing? Yes, we did, your honor. And I do have affidavit of publication. Did we receive any written correspondence at city hall with regard to census? No, we did. Okay, let's open the public hearing with regard to the Edgewood Drive reconstruction project. Anyone here wish to be heard on this item? You can be heard by approaching the podium in the back. Please state your name and your address. We'd like to hear from you. Anyone want to be heard? Or maybe you're just listening for the description? Okay, if you would like to be heard, why don't you start making your way back to the podium? Please state your name and your address before. Before you start speaking. And we'd love to hear from you. My name is Doug McDonald. I'm at 1915 Edgewood Drive. I guess the only question that I really had was concerning the water main project. The water main is currently underneath the northerly side of Edgewood. So when the water company comes in to tear that out, they're going to have to remove pavement at that time. Is that correct? They're actually going to be installing the water main on the south side. Okay. So. But they're gonna have the street disrupted at the time that they're. Or they're doing it outside of the street? Yeah, it's outside of the pavement limits. It'll be on the south side within the, you know, maybe five. Gotcha. Okay. All right. Nope, that's. But then one of the things, too, though, is when they. They're gonna be doing an open cut with that project. So when they open it up, they're gonna be cutting a small section of the driveway out to install the water main. And then as soon as they're done, they will rock it. So then you'll have access in it to facilitate the staging that we. That I just showed you tonight. But it will be rocked temporarily. Okay. All right. Okay. That's the only question I have. Thank you, sir. Marcy Haynes, 2015 Edgewood Drive. Question I have is about emergency vehicles being able to come through. Did you say that it's going to be. They're working on both sides of the street at the same time? That is correct. So is there going to be a problem if there is an emergency? Ambulances, that type of thing. Will there be access for those? Yeah, well, that's why it's being phased the way it is. And then, obviously, when it's awarded to the contractor, we will sit down with them, and sometimes they have different ideas on how to stage it. But we've done this for quite a while. We feel that this is the best staging for this particular project, given the width of the neighborhood, the streets in the neighborhood and whatnot. But obviously, when they start removing the pavement, first they will rock right behind it so that it will allow access in and out. Now, you will not have access to your home, but we will have access for vehicles to move back and forth through the project. Okay, that's fine. Thank you. It's really Richland, 1934 Edgewood. My question is, is there going to be some place designated for us to park or we just have to find something? No, there will be a designated spot. Once we get the contract awarded, we will sit down with them. And in the letter that you guys received back on. I mean, it was mailed on February 14, but it did note that another information letter with some of the information that I provided tonight. It'll be in clear detail about where to park, about your garbage service and things like that, who to contact, as well as not only from the city, but from the contractor themselves, just in case if there's an issue with that's happening with the project while it's being constructed. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Anybody else wish to be heard? Okay, let's close that public hearing on the Edgewood drive reconstruction project. Councilmember sexer, please. Thank you. Your honor, I have a resolution approving the plan, specification and form of contract for the Edgewood Drive reconstruction project project from 19th street to 21st Street. I move approval of the resolution. Second. We have a motion and a second. Any discussion on this item from council? Yes, councilmember Shexer? Thank you. Your honor, I do have two more questions. As a result of the public comments for the parking area, will we provide a little bit extra police protection, since, you know, we've had problems throughout the city once in a while with breaking of cars. You know, now that these cars are going to be away from the home, can I add something real quick before it? Go ahead. I'm sorry. So when we have a staging area for a construction project, we'll have a barricaded section where they'll actually park to denote that it's, you know, parking just for those homeowners only during the construction phase.

So when we have a staging area for a construction project, we'll have a barricaded section where they'll actually park to denote that it's, you know, parking just for those homeowners only during the construction phase. And then obviously, the police department will be aware of that as well, knowing where those residents are parking their vehicles. Given the different stagings of the project, and to your point, we can make our officers aware. To his point of what's going on, I would just say that as long as your vehicles are locked up and you have nothing in plain view, you are at very low risk. The only time cars generally get entered is when they're unlocked and when there's items of value in plain view. If you can eliminate those two opportunities. No items of value in plain view and lock a car, you're much, much lower risk, and the likelihood is that they aren't going to mess with your car. Thanks. Thank you, staff. Further discussion? All right, hearing none. Michelle, would you please call the roll? Noman? Aye. Sexer. Aye. Baden. Aye. Falchinski. Aye. Jagger. Aye. We have unanimously approved the Edgewood Drive reconstruction project. We move to another public hearing. Brian, would you just give us a quick rundown of the full depth patching program? I know council is well aware of that. It comes up every year in budget. And one of the things, too, that's important to point out this, and I'm gonna put your mic a little closer. Sorry. Sorry about that. Thank you, your honor. This is just removing and replacing concrete patches within our concrete pavement. But it's important to note, though, too, that we do have a little bit of contingency built into this project. So when the staff actually is out potholing patches or potholing just after the winter months and whatnot, there are certain pavement areas that have popped up. So when they're out potholing, they also note those particular areas that are larger than normal, like just a crack in the pavement. So those patches will be added in there that we've identified over the winter months. Perfect. Thank you. Questions for Brian. Michelle, did we publish notice of this public hearing? Yes, we did, your honor, and I do have affidavit of publication. Did we receive any written correspondence with regard to this? No, we did not. All right, let's open the public hearing with regard to our foot left patching program. Anybody here wish to be heard on this item? All right, let's close that public hearing and move to the resolution. Council member Palczynski, please. Thank you, your honor, I have a resolution approving the plan, specification and form of contract for the 2024 full depth patching program. I move approval of the resolution second. Any discussion here. Michelle, please call the roll. Noman? Aye. Sexer? Aye. Baden? Aye. Belchinsky? Aye. Jagger? Aye. All right, we have, you naturally passed the fold up patching program for 2024. We have a public hearing with regard to the 33rd street drainage improvements. Ryan, would you like to tell us about those improvements, at least in a general form? Thank you, your honor. This is removing and, excuse me, reconstructing approximately 15 of ditch, adding, grading or adding storm sewer. Doing some grading through this project. It's important to note that this project is entirely funded through the Iowa Department of Homeland Security Mitigation grant, so there is no obligation to the city for this particular project. Thank you, sir. Your honor, if we recall, this was a request by Sivier steele about eight years ago, and we finally got the federal grant for this before the fire, but we're still going to proceed with the project because it's good for the area. This will eliminate a whole lot of storm sewer activity to that site. Well, there you have it. Unfortunate for severe steele. Okay, michelle, did we publish notice of this public hearing? Yes, we did, your honor. And I do have affidavit of publication. Did we receive any written correspondence with regard to the same. Let's open the public hearing for the 33rd street drainage improvements. Anybody here wish to be heard on this item? I will close that public hearing and move to the resolution. Council members sexor, please. Thank you, your honor. I have a resolution approving the plan, specification and form of contract for the 33rd street drainage improvements. I move approval of the resolution. Second. Any discussion here? Michelle, please call the roll. Noman? Aye. Sexer? Aye. Baden? Aye. Pelczinski? Aye. Jagger? Aye. All right, that resolution unanimously passed. We move to another public hearing. This is with regard to 4255 middle Road, the Blum residence, and there's a request for some rezoning. Mister Hunt, do you have a quick rundown for us? Sure, your honor. I think we've talked about this one before, but it is a couple parcels to accommodate basically single family homes near an existing single family home that's on 15 acres. So about two and a half acres reserved for two more single family homes, subdivided out, rezoned to two reals, which is consistent with the neighborhood. And then there's one out lot because there's some floodway that needs to be exempted from development. So a pretty, pretty small subdivision.

It has a new use to accommodate that use. We do need to upgrade it to a c three zoning, which is actually fairly consistent with the large shopping center just south of it. The whole acreage? The whole. Roughly twelve acres would go from c two to c three. And that would include the existing. There was a financial institution, a former bank, as part of the lot that would be an allowable use for the bank. So we're consistent with all the existing users and we're accommodating a new use for a building that we're really happy to see have tenants. Finally. Thank you, sir. Any questions for Mister Hunt? Yes, Councilmember Palczynski. Yeah, just for clarification, this would allow for additional development on the frontage of that road as well. Right. Pretty big parcel with twelve acres there.

All right. Very good. Good evening, everyone. Welcome to the board of adjustment for the city of Bettendorf for May 9, 2024. Roll call. Gallagher? Yes. Spranger? Tansy? Tom. Berks. Yes. Vermillion. Yes. Okay, we have three, and that's a quorum, so we can move forward. This is a board of adjustment. It's a five member board, of which three are here tonight. We are appointed by the mayor, and it's our job to review certain things that are properly before us, one of which is the special uses, and that's what's before us tonight. The next item on the agenda is to review the minutes of March 14, which was our last meeting. You've had an opportunity to look at the minutes. Do I have any additions or corrections? No. Okay. All those in favor, say of approving the minutes, say aye. Opposed? Same sign hearing? None. They're approved. Then the item is. The board is to hold public hearing on the following cases. And we have one. It's case 240. Three nine. It's a 25 70 middle road. It's a c two, a special use permit to allow a bar and an outdoor service area with alcohol. Submitted by Sim Golf, Quad Cities One, LLC. Greg, do you have a staff report? Mister chairman, this case, as you mentioned, does involve two special use permits. The area is accessed off of Middle Road. It's right near Spruce Hills and 23rd. And where they intersect with Middle Road, it's just due east of there. It is on lot three of Bettendorf, Ewing Bettendorf, first edition. As you can see, we have a mixture of different uses of land, urban low intensity to the south, parks and open space. We have public, semi public ground just due east on the church lot, and then urban medium intensity, either east, northeast, and then west of this site. And then the majority is commercial community, commercial type designation, which facilitates c two zoning. Much of this area has been zoned c two, as you can see here throughout this area, c one either side, and that there is a delineation. Pretty much anything north of Middle Road is in a commercial designation. The area to the south is primarily r one and then r two zoning. This is a view currently of the structure as it is being constructed at present, with x golf being in this area of the building. And then this area here will be the future outdoor patio area. This was the initial site plan, and it showed 63 parking spaces. And it showed one means of entry coming in here with one aisle of parking and then two aisles of parking here, two different entry points through what is an easement for access on the adjoining northwest bank towers lot. This is an updated version. This is more updated than the one in the packet that you have that we recently received showing 77 parking spaces and two rows of parking here. This area is occupied. One space was removed with parking to accommodate a dumpster. These are how the parking kelks were conducted, showing the area for the golf simulation. The bar, kitchen areas, assembly area. This gives you an idea to the patio area. And then a total of 55 parking spaces was yielded using the different variety of uses that are contained within the proposed structure. That leaves 22 parking spaces available for the remainder of this building. There essentially be a unit here and then these two units here, and then everything else below will be contained within ex Golf ex Golf's operating hours would be Monday through Thursday, 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. friday, 10:00 a.m. to midnight Saturday, 08:00 a.m. to 01:00 a.m. sunday and then on Sundays 08:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and that's according to the correspondence we received from the business owners. Breaking this down and looking at the attributes of what a special use permit is required to meet, there are nine different steps, and the first two I've shown here deal with number one, bars and outdoor service of alcoholic beverages are required to have special use permits, and they would therefore be allowed in a c two community commercial district. That means in the second step, we look at the other provisions that are required, such as liquor licensing, building operations, site plan development approval, which will be appearing next week before the planning and zoning Commission on the 15th at 530 in this very room, and then building permits, inspections, and other applicable regulations regarding this parcel. There are also special provisions and performance standards regarding any activities that are taking place on site. Step three is the commercial zoning surrounding the area primarily has been commercial.

That means in the second step, we look at the other provisions that are required, such as liquor licensing, building operations, site plan development approval, which will be appearing next week before the planning and zoning Commission on the 15th at 530 in this very room, and then building permits, inspections, and other applicable regulations regarding this parcel. There are also special provisions and performance standards regarding any activities that are taking place on site. Step three is the commercial zoning surrounding the area primarily has been commercial. On this side of Middle Road, as I mentioned earlier, there is an access that comes off of Middle Road, and then there are two different access points that come into this area through the northwest bank parking lot. The building had already been approved and this footprint is not changing from what had been originally adopted. Landscaping hasn't changed either. Despite adding this aisle, only 189 additional square feet were added in terms of our landscape ordinance. So the landscaping plan remains intact from what it had been with seven trees regarding the buffer bordering area and then four trees in the interior for the vehicular use area. 55 parking spaces are being allocated for this particular business, and that means every other business that comes in here will have to be evaluated to see that the remaining 22 spaces are allocated correctly. One looks at the distancing in step number six. We find that the closest residential structure south of this particular building is 250ft away. The church is 165ft away from this structure, Northwest bank tower, 137ft away, and the vintage cooperative is basically 305ft away due north. Step number seven. There have been no prior applications within the last year, but there also have been no prior applications for special use permits for this parcel, ever. Step eight conditions staff would recommend for BoA approval. One, the owner of the multi tenant retail structure verifies all proposed uses with staff prior to any lease being signed by the potential tenants to be in the building. Use by writer special use permit and parking requirements must be evaluated by city staff prior to permitting any use in the building. That's because potentially, for the constrained nature and the amount of parking consumed by this particular use, approval of a revised site development plan by the city council is required to make special use permits active. And as again, as I mentioned, that will be next week on the 15th at 530 in this room. That north comprehensive plan goal that is being met here. Goal C is to attract and retain business and industry and staff when evaluating this, would recommend approval with the conditions as I mentioned before in step number eight, and that any other conditions that the board of adjustment may deem necessary may be as well applied to this recommendation. I would ask, are there any questions, any questions from the commission tenants after the initial tenants would still be required to get approval. Like after we went into a second lease period? Yes. I mean, what we're looking at, we've run into this problem with numerous locations. This is not unique just to this building. And we see this overspill potential. We want to make sure that there is containment on the site, and that's a requirement. Site itself, a lot of record has to meet the requirements. You're not entitled, unless you have a special location plan, to look for other parking elsewhere. This is not what's being discussed. There is no special location plan here, so that's why we evaluate it the way we do. Okay, thank you. Any other questions? Okay. Anyone wish to speak in favor of the application? I would. Okay. Want to go back to the podium and state your name and then present your testimony, I guess. Evidence, whatever. I feel very distant from you right now. It is. It is awkward, frankly. Well, good evening. So, I'm Matthew Mulligan. My address is 1167 Hunters Ridge in Dubuque, Iowa. I actually own the structure, so I'm the owner and the builder of it. So I appreciate, number one, your efforts. I appreciate staff's efforts on this as we've gone through this process. The goal was to build a structure in the community that could be flexible, so could allow for a lot of different uses, as it was stated, where our goal is to attract business into the community. And so we want something that's certainly flexible today to attract businesses such as X golf. But at some point down the road, there'll be another business looking at it. So we want something very flexible there. One point I do want to make, which I think was very well stated by Greg, was there will be additional conversations as it relates to parking for the future tenants. And we've had a lot of different groups looking at it, those from a Krispy Kreme doughnut, which would have been really great to others as well. And so one of the partners on the project at a financial level is Northwest bank and trust. And so this is not what I'm saying here is not to suggest they will participate in this way, but they are very friendly to us in that one goal is to not just create impermeable parking space where it's unnecessary. We have a lot of parking there next to us. Those conversations will continue with them to make sure we're not. We don't want to over park. We want to park just right. And so what we've done right now is adequately accommodated. What's needed for ex golf, which will be great, and then for future tenants, we'll make sure that as we come before the PNZ board with site plan approval, that we've got, you know, things figured out. So again, we're just. We want to park just right. We don't want to have a bunch of, a bunch of dead space throughout the day. So with that, I am in favor of the request that has been made and I appreciate your time. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions for Matthew?

So with that, I am in favor of the request that has been made and I appreciate your time. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions for Matthew? The only question I had was on your hours a little bit. Only because they seem very extended for a sports bar kind of atmosphere. 08:00 a.m. on Sunday. I am not the owner of the company itself of the ex golf. However, our owner is here and maybe would you like to speak to it? Chat? Sure. Okay. Again, I hate to say, but go back there so we can. Mister chairman, if it pleases the board too. It would be interesting to know if the hours for the golf and the patio were the same. That's kind of where I was going with outdoor noise. Good evening. My name is Chet Henderson. I am one of the owners of the sex golf. I do own the currently the ex golf in Boise, Idaho. So I can answer hopefully a lot of your questions from an operations standpoint of what it is and what it isn't. The hours, like, for example, in Boise right now, differentiate very much summer versus winter. It's a very seasonal business. Generally have much longer hours in the winter when people can't play outside across the street from us, and we'll have shorter hours in the summer. So needless to say, the summer is our slow time. The ex golfing boise doesn't have an outside patio area. Most of them don't. But we viewed this as a way as to maybe make our business more appealing, more neighborhood friendly for people who might want to have a drink other than just to just a golf. It's not. We don't look at ourselves as, like, a bar bar. It doesn't attract the crowd of a normal bar. And I'm not trying to speak negative poorly upon bars, but it's a family friendly environment. We'll have free kids clubs at all times. From, like, a noise standpoint outside. I don't envision that ever being an issue from a noise standpoint. I'm trailing off. I think you asked the hours. Originally. We're at hours. Those are ballpark hours, I would say at wintertime. In summertime, like right now in Boise, I open at 11:00 a.m. i close at 10:00 p.m. i don't open past 11:00 p.m. in Boise in the middle of winter. I think midnight is the latest I've seen any exclus across the country stay open from a time standpoint. Mark, can you refresh? Nose noise ordinance. It goes to effect at 10:00 p.m. and the decibels that are read or rated are different between different zones and how they buffer. Gonna be honest with you, I can hear the traffic behind us as we're sitting here, and that intersection is pretty busy. So you're gonna have a lot of white noise or ambient noise already provided. So to me, the patio, probably, if they're not golfing on the patio, which they're not. The golf facility is inside. The patio is not golfing, which I think was the testimony you just received. So then it's just your normal NBA, you know, kind of normal outdoor dining sounds, I guess. Will you be having outdoor bands? No. Okay. And then there would be. They would be subject to that 10:00 p.m. noise restriction anyway. Okay. No matter their hours of operation. So I don't think. I think the thought originally was, would you be hearing, like, clubs? It's the constant ping, ping, ping of a club. I don't think that activity is taking place outside. Certainly doesn't look like it from the application. So I think that noise. I was more concerned about bands. So no bands. Okay. Doesn't show a stage space. That's a pretty small space to set up a band. It's pretty small. Be pretty, pretty tight. That's all I had. Okay. That's all I've got. Anyone else wants to speak in favor of it? Okay, thank you. Anybody wish to speak opposed to it? Good evening. I'm Tammy Spidel. I live at 25 92 Middle Road, suite 121. That is the suites vintage cooperative of Bettendorf. And I want to first say, I don't. We're not opposed. We just have some concerns that we wanted to share. And so first, I'd like to draw your attention to the application of page three, item five, bullet three, which states that extra ground acquired by the developer from lot one, Ewing Bettendor, first edition, permitted more parking to be added to the east side of that structure. To date, that is not true. There has been no property acquisition. We do not have a signed purchase agreement. We are in negotiation for them to acquire some property, but that has not happened as of today. So while we do intend to sell them property, we haven't reached that agreement. And without that, there are no. Your 15 spaces short according to the original site plan. And so we are concerned about that, that this document does say that that's happened, and it has not. The other thing that we are concerned about is this does not occupy the entire building. And as you've already discussed, the remaining parking spaces are very limited. And so if you happen to come our way over the 4 July, you'll notice there's parking all the way up and down the lane to our parking lot. And we're concerned that some of this would overflow there, which would limit the width of that would limit the ability for fire trucks, ambulances, et cetera, to get through. So we are concerned about that. We're asking that if you do move forward ", "answer_v2": "[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Northwest Bank and Trust\",\n    \"positives\": [\n      \"Friendly relationship with local community\",\n      \"Engaged in conversations to prevent unnecessary impermeable parking spaces\"\n    ],\n    \"negatives\": [],\n    \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n    \"comment\": \"While their relationship with the local community is positive, there is not enough financial performance data to make a definitive investment decision.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Ex Golf\",\n    \"positives\": [\n      \"Family-friendly environment\",\n      \"No outdoor bands, adhering to noise ordinances\",\n      \"Intends to operate within noise regulations\"\n    ],\n    \"negatives\": [\n      \"Potential parking issue due to incomplete property acquisition\",\n      \"Seasonal business with shorter summer hours\"\n    ],\n    \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n    \"comment\": \"The family-friendly ambiance and adherence to noise regulations are positives.

We see a lot of traffic now racing through, down the driveway from Northwest Boulevard north to our property, around and out to where our private drive meets happy Joe Drive. And we would like some assurances that there's going to be some signage saying no right turns, things of that nature to try and limit that, because our property is private property and the added wear and tear will fall back onto us to maintain. So, again, not necessarily concerned with the, you know, proposed tenant. We have avid golfers in our building. I'm sure they're super excited that they're going to have some place to practice over the winter. Just some concerns about what it stated in the application and the limited parking places remaining. Thank you. Would you repeat who you are? Sure. I'm Tammy Spidel. I happen to live at the vintage cooperative. So that's a 55 and better community. I just didn't hear the vintage art. Thank you. Thank you, honey. But if we're. If I understand it correctly, they can't move forward without those extra spaces anyway. Yeah, you're right. I think the issue is, can they park the building adequately? They would need 55 parking spaces, if I remember correctly, to park that use. Not the entire building, but just that use on that south end. So you might make a motion subject to parking availability and all the standards, but they're required to meet those standards. I would be a little nervous about requiring someone to acquire certain property because there may be other ways to solve the parking issue through a special location plan with orthos bank or others. They certainly have to meet our parking requirements, however they do it, whether it's acquisition or some other arrangement, because it sounded like negotiations were with Northwest bank, too, with parking that was intimated in his testimony. Right. Yeah. But there are. There's more than one option, apparently, for getting those spaces. Yep. Okay. And it would be required that they have those spaces before they be able to move forward with the project. Right. Dual process is going on here. So this has come to you before with a site location special. I'm sorry. This is come to planning and zoning commission four with a site development plan that was approved with restaurant retail office concept. Because it was built on spec. The applicant came to us and said, hey, just so you know, this is a little bit different than I originally thought of. Right. But I want to propose it to you. And this is actually considered controlled impact use. So we're going to make that controlled impact use which is allowable in this district. Controlled recreational impact. Excuse me. We're gonna make that go back through site development plan with planning and zoning. So we're. We have kind of two parallel processes here. And that's yet next week that that will happen. The bar portion of this, because it's got a bar in it and the outdoor patio portion of this. What's before you today, you could. You could look at those separate from ex golf, because they really. They really are. And that that approval, if you give it today with whatever conditions you would approve, would only be subject to the site development plan being approved. And you're only talking about a bar and a patio, not necessarily ex golf in particular. That makes sense. Sorry for the long winded answer. Has the city ever looked at this? Seems sort of backwards, even as I'm about to say it, but I'll say it anyway, saying, yes, this is fine. You can go with just the parking that you have, but the uses of the last two would have to be such that we'd only need four places instead of ten. Yep. All the time. Or sometimes that issue is resolved by offsetting hours. So you have a daytime only, a breakfast restaurant next to a bar, night only bar. They can share spaces. Some of that's in our code. There's certainly potential partnerships here with Northwest bank, which appears to have a fair amount of parking for overrun, possibly at land acquisition. That has not occurred yet, but it seems to be possible as well. So I think, you know, conditioning this recommendation or approval, if you make it on the appropriate parking, would make all the sense in the world. Isn't the appropriate parking part of the ultimate site plan that's coming up next week? And I think it's not like there's zero parking. Right. No one's already parked for a modicum, you know, kind of a general parking plan. So proposal. This use is just a little bit special because those golf bays are parked at four cars each, you know, four people each. Right. So. And it's Chet, right? Chet, yes. So just to understand what the outdoor bar area is going to encompass is just seating, maybe a tv, you know, and that. And is there going to be actually a bar out there or bars served from the inside? There's just the 1 bar. The inside bar.

That solves the parking problem in the sense that they won't get the site plan unless they have adequate parking.

Welcome to the Bettendorf City Council meeting. Today is Tuesday, May 21, 2024, at 07:00 p.m. michelle, would you please call the roll? Adamson. Here. Brown. Here. Jagger. Here. Naumann. Here. Sexer. Here. Baden. Here. Palczynski. Thank you all for being here. Now, if you could all please rise, remove any caps or headdresses you may have and join us in the pledge of allegiance, which will be followed by an invocation given by Bettany, fire and police chaplain and pastor of Asbury United Methodist Church, Pastor Tom Carver. Please remain standing for the invocation. I pledge of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Pastor let us pray, gracious God, on this weekend that we remember those who have served our country. Memorial Day weekend. We're grateful for all those who have gone before us, for all the names that are listed at the Veterans Memorial park in our city, but also folks who have gone before us to make this a premier city. From the Bettendorf brothers, whose city bears their name, to Mayor Hutchinson, whose plaza outside this building bears her name, to the be the light park just down the block that bears the name of citizens such as Dale Owen, we're thankful for their work. We pray for your guidance so that someday in the future, people will look back upon this body, this group and all of us, and be thankful for what we've done to make this world a better place. And Bettendorf, a premier city that is a blessing to all its citizens, an example to all other communities. We again thank you for the servants here tonight, and we look forward to what you're going to do and ask that you work through all of us. And we pray this in God's name. Amen. Amen. Thank you, pastor. Pastor Tom, if you'd like to please join me up here. Come on up, chief. Come on up. Our police chief, Keith Kimball and our fire chief, Troy said. Pastor Tom has been a vetner police and fire chaplain since 2018. He has officially retired as of July 1 from Asbury United Methodist Church. Just throw a stone's throw away and we'd like to thank you for your contributions to our community. Pastor Tom and Linda sold their house here. They've moved into their house south of Inola, near where their grandkids are. So it's a great retirement after more than 40 years in the ministry. So we really appreciate you. One of the things Pastor Tom has done for our community is bring the faith based leaders group to fruition. Tom has served in other areas, obviously, as pastors tend to move a little bit. And when he was in Cedar Rapids, he learned a lot about response to disasters. Knowledge he brought here. He was on a city council before as the mayor pro tem. Right. So he has brought with him a lot cedar at Ceuville, not in Cedar Rapids, the budding metropolis of Shoei. But I think what has helped us is your expertise in how we can work together. And I was fortunate enough to follow your lead to try to put this group together. And we're going to meet tomorrow and work on some succession so that we continue to do good things in the community. And if you would, maybe you would share with the group our motto and then what you say at the end of each one of our meetings so that we all may have a phrase or two for which we may remember you. Well, let's see. I guess we define ourselves as people of faith who are building trusting relationships in order to improve our community. And kind of the ecumenical blessing we would end our meetings with was go in peace, but don't go to pieces. Very apropos for the work that we've been doing. I would like to invite both of you to say a few words about Pastor Tom and the work that he's done here with the city of Metendorf as a police chaplain and as a fire chaplain. Yeah, I'll go first. Mister mayor, you hit it on, you know, perfectly when you said he's good at the time of response. But I think more importantly, what I respect most about you, Pastor Carver, is the time, not during response. You would show up for our Zoom meetings in the morning, in the afternoon, just to say hi. And I think you did that because you connect with people at that time. And that was really important because, you know, when police and fire, it's not easy in those difficult times to open up to somebody if you don't know them. And by you stopping by, you know, just having a cup of coffee really helped out. So truly appreciate it. Good luck to you with your new chapter and just expounding on that. What you've done for our community and our police department specifically, too, like Chief Sait said, just your presence just popping in when there weren't times of crisis or need and just getting to know our officers, their families being present.

And you do have a wonderful city council and a great staff, and this is a wonderful city. We're gonna miss it. We will come visit. But the grandkids are calling. Yes, I totally understand. 1231 more. One, two, three. Thank you. All right. Very good. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Nicole, would you come up and join me? Hello, dear. How are you? Thanks for all the great work you do in our community. We do have a proclamation today. This is for mental health awareness Month, which is the month of May. This proclamation was requested by the Quad Cities Open Network, and it will be received tonight by Nicole Kartner, the executive director of the Quad Cities Health Initiative. I got to know Nicole a little better during a daily Zoom call for a number of months when we started Covid, and then thereafter, weekly and monthly. I don't miss those calls, though. I do miss seeing you. You do great work in this community. So we're very appreciative of you. The Open Network, the health initiative, and all the good stuff that you guys are doing, we do have a proclamation from the Office of the mayor. Whereas mental health is essential to our physical health and our overall health in our community, and whereas last year, the community health assessment reported that nearly a quarter of quad citizens are receiving treatment for a mental health condition, and whereas, in July of 2022, the FCC launched a 988 telephone number to call to replace the national suicide prevention lifeline in an effort to make it easier for people to access a lifeline anyway. And wHereas, the Quad Cities Behavioral Health Coalition is working to share this message and to educate the public on the resources available to positively impact the behavioral health of the Quad Cities, more information can be found at qCBHC dot weebly.com. now, therefore, I, Robert Gallagher, the mayor of the City of Benton, North Iowa, do hereby proclaim the month of May as mental health awareness month in our community. And I encourage all citizens to promote the ongoing education on the importance of prioritizing mental health and reaching out to get connected to services if a mental health concern arises. Excellent. Thank you so much, mayor, and to all the members of city council and all the staff here at the City of Bettendorf, I'm here with a couple hats on tonight. Some of you know me from my work with the Quad City Health Initiative. And through that work, we do ongoing community health assessments, which has helped to identify and prioritize mental health as one of the key health issues in our community. And from that work, we were fortunate to partner with several organizations in co creating the Quad City Behavioral Health Coalition, and to also partner with the Quad Cities Open Network who made this request this evening. And their partnership has led, led to the Zero Suicide initiative. So hopefully some of those ideas, concepts, coalitions are familiar to all of you. I see a few familiar faces in the room who have had the chance to work with us. And we just really. On behalf of the members of the steering committee for the Behavioral Health Coalition and our partners at the Zero Suicide Initiative project, we just want to thank you for your ongoing support, for your help in raising awareness of the importance of mental health to our overall health in the community, and for your help in raising awareness about the resources that are available to help individuals who may find themselves in moments of crisis. So we appreciate so much your proclamation this evening, and I will proudly return and share it on social media and with our partners and let them all know of your collective support. One more. One, two, three. Thank you. Thank you. All right. We have reached public request of counsel. If there's anybody here who wishes to be heard on an item not already on tonight's agenda for a public. Now is your time to address counsel and make your request. Please state your name and address before you speak. We'd like to hear from you. Just here for the coffee tonight, Ray. Free coffee. You can't beat it. There you go. It's nice to see you. We're glad you're here. All right, we'll close the public request of counsel and move to our first public hearing.

One, two, three. Thank you. Thank you. All right. We have reached public request of counsel. If there's anybody here who wishes to be heard on an item not already on tonight's agenda for a public. Now is your time to address counsel and make your request. Please state your name and address before you speak. We'd like to hear from you. Just here for the coffee tonight, Ray. Free coffee. You can't beat it. There you go. It's nice to see you. We're glad you're here. All right, we'll close the public request of counsel and move to our first public hearing. This is with regard to next year's. Excuse me, this year's 23 four budget amendment. Michelle, did we publish notice of this public hearing? Yes, we did, your honor. And I do have affidavit of publication. Did we receive any written correspondence with regard to the same. No, we did not. Okay. Jason went through this last night. Do we have any questions for Jason before we formally open this public hearing? No, sir. Did you want to do a presentation? Are we okay? I'm happy to. Whatever you. I think we got our questions out last night. I think everybody's good. Let's go to the public hearing. Let's open the public hearing with regard to the schist budget amendment. Is there anybody here who wishes to be heard on this item? Okay, we'll close that public hearing and move to the resolution. Councilmember Baden, please. Thank you, your honor. I have a resolution adopting fiscal year 20 23 24 budget amendment. I move approval of the resolution. Second, is there further discussion on the budget amendment after our discussion last night? Aye. Seeing no movement, Michelle, would you please call the roll? Sexer? Aye. Baden? Aye. Adamson? Aye. Brown? Aye. Jagger? Aye. Naaman? Aye. We have unanimously approved the budget amendment. Thank you and your staff for your hard work, as well as the department heads who all have input and made that happen. The next item on tonight's agenda is for another public hearing. This is the 2024 rural road sealcoat program. Brian, would you just give us a few sentences? I think we're all pretty aware of this program, but we do have a big one coming in. Thank you. Your honor, this is just an annual program to chip and seal existing streets that have a rural cross section in the city of Bendorf. Any questions for brian? We've been through the CIP. You know where they're headed. Okay. Michelle, did we publish notice of this public hearing? Yes, we did, your honor, and I do have affidavit of publication. Did we receive any written correspondence with regard to the same. No, we did not. Let's open the public hearing on our 2024 rural road seal coat program. Anybody here wish to be heard on this item? All right, we close that public hearing. Council member sexter, can you help us with the resolution, please? Thank you, your honor. I have a resolution approving the plans, specifications and form of contract for the 2024 Royal Road Seal coat program. I move approval of the resolution. Second, is there further discussion on the seal code program? Michelle, can you please call the roll? Sexer? Aye. Baden? Aye. Adamson? Aye. Brown? Jagger? Aye. Nauman? Aye. We have unanimously passed the 2024 rural seal coat program. We move to a third and final reading of an ordinance. Councilmember Brown, please. Thank. Your honor, I have the third and final reading of an ordinance amending city code title eight, chapter two, entitled Sewer use and service. I move approval of the ordinance at its final reading. Second, any discussion here? We've heard this twice on an ordinance review, once on a committee of the whole. Michelle, please call the roll. Sexer? Aye. Baden? Aye. Adamson? Aye. Brown? Jagger? Aye. Nauman? Aye. We have unanswered approve that third and final reading, we move to our consent agenda. I'd like to entertain a motion to approve the same at this time. So move. Second, any discussion on any particular item on consent? I know we had some questions last night. Yes. Councilmember Baden. Thank you, your honor. Just wanted to ask Mark hunt, how many more homes are we going after? We're authorized 18 homes in the current grant round, which started in 2021. We will not be able to buy the eleven remaining homes, probably will probably pick up three or four more, but we probably won't have buyers that are ready to sell in that timeframe. We could, but I would suspect with the economics and replacement housing costs that those buyers, sellers are facing, that will probably pick up three or four. Thank you. Any other questions or comments, council? Yes. Councilmember Jagger? Thank you, your honor. In all my questions last night, I forgot to thank staff, and I wanted to do that. Staff was instrumental in getting not one but two grants that we talked about last night. I think that's very important for helping keep our tax dollars used effectively. I didn't say thank you to them for that last night. I want to rectify that and say thank you tonight. Nicely done. Anything else on consent? All right, Michelle, would you please call the roll on consent? Sexer? Aye. Baden? Aye. Adamson? Aye. Brown? Aye. Jagger? Aye. Naaman. Aye. We have unanimously approved each and every item on tonight's consent agenda. At this time, I'd like to entertain a motion to adjourn. Just one quick thing before we, council member Adamson, thank you. As most of you are aware, we're turning over the veterans memorial to the city, most of it except for the ceremonies, and that hopefully will still be done by the veterans groups here in Bettendorf.

Okay. Welcome to the board of adjustment meeting for the city of Bettendorf. Roll call. Gallagher? Yes. Sprenger? Tansy? Tomberg. Yes. Vermilion? Yes. Okay, thank you. This is the board of adjustment. We are normally a five member board, three of which are here today. And it's our responsibility. First of all, we're appointed by the mayor, and it's our responsibility to interpret the city zoning ordinances as it applies to variances and special uses. The board's first responsibility tonight is to approve minutes of the December 14, 2023 meeting. Okay, I'll have a motion to approve. Second. All those in favor say aye. Anybody opposed? If not, they're approved. The next thing on the agenda is to review the 2023 Board of Adjustment annual report. We have that. You have that in front of you. It was sent to you. I don't know whether anybody wants to talk about it, but basically it looks like the special uses were about the same as the year before, if I remember my talking again, and the. About the same, and. I'm sorry, the variances were about the same, and the special uses were down a little bit from the year before. Mark, do you have anything you want to say about it? No. No real tea use. Reading that report, that's just kind of cyclical. It seems we had a lot of stuff after Covid, then it kind of quieted down. I think it just depends on construction patterns and people's choices for the types of lots they want. Okay. Do we need then to have a motion to accept it and file it or approve it? I'll move to approve the 2023 board of adjustment annual report. Second. Okay. All those in favor say aye, that nobody's opposed, so therefore it passes. The next item is election of officers. Do you want to proceed since there's only three of us here, or do you want to wait till the next meeting? I propose we wait until the next meeting. Okay, let's just defer that till the next meeting then. The next item is the board to hold a public hearing on the following cases. And the first is case 20. I'm sorry, the first case is withdrawn. And that was on Tangle foot. And the second one is case 240. Zero seven. It's at 3066 Victoria street. It's a c one. It's a special location plan to allow off street parking at 3333 18th street to meet the minimum parking space requirements. Submitted by Carolyn up to campus for Bettendorf Community School District. Do we have a staff report? Yes, we do, mister chairman camp. I guess this used to be a former financial services office since been acquired by the Bettendorf Public Schools district and the site is going to be converted into an academy style schooling for high school individuals. It's at 36 six Victoria street. This is 33 33 18th street, the high school. This special location plan concerns using a portion of this parking lot to help meet the requirements here for the students who are here. This essentially is going to be an area set up for this parking here. For the employees who happen to be working from this building, the student parking is going to be placed over here. You have two different land uses. Urban low intensity r one zoning here on the school site, and then you have urban medium intensity with c one neighborhood commercial district zoning on this locale. And the comprehensive plan goal g is met by enhancing educational opportunities, by protecting and maintaining institutions within the city limits. The site here has been changed. I mean, the ordinance is updated to allow an educational institution in a c one district that was completed last year so that this site is conforming as to the uses. The building as you see it right here, was built in the 1980s. The addition of four classroom spaces is going to be placed in the southwest corner of this particular lot of record. The south boundary here is your side lot line. This is your rear lot line. And then this area is the two frontages on Maple Crest and then Victoria street that constitute the surroundings for the site and the setbacks. This is an architectural breakout. There will be 50 to 60 students typically in this academy of program, with a maximum of 70. So we calculated the parking based on that maximum. 30 of the students would already normally be attending Bettendorf High School to begin with. So they're somewhat not counted per se in this total. What we did as staff is we looked at the number of employees. We'll be using the site of seven that meets the on site parking requirement. And then we analyze the number of spaces would be attributed to out of district students using this site as a maximum, and that would be 40 students. One space is required for each student. So essentially we're looking at ten spaces total that would be needed to be placed upon the other site. Currently you have 324 parking spaces that are a portion of the southern parking lot at Bettendorf High School. 594 more spaces are located north of the high school. So we have, in essence, a great deal of parking with ten spaces", "answer_v2": "[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Bettendorf Community School District\",\n    \"positives\": [\n      \"Enhancing educational opportunities by changing property usage for academy style schooling for high school individuals.\",\n      \"Conforming to updated ordinance allowing educational institution in the C-1 district.\",\n      \"Construction plan includes addition of four classroom spaces.\",\n      \"Adequate parking space allocation to meet requirements for employees and students.\"\n    ],\n    \"negatives\": [],\n    \"decision\": \"buy\",\n    \"comment\": \"The Bettendorf Community School District is aligning with city regulations and expanding its educational facilities to enhance educational opportunities.

Here. Baden. Here. Palczynski. Here. Well, thank you all for being here. Now, if you could all please rise, remove any caps or headdresses you may have and join us in the pledge of Allegiance, which will be followed by an invocation given by Alan Ross, the executive director of the Jewish Federation of the Quad Cities. Please remain standing for the invocation. My pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Ellen, please. For over a thousand years, rabbis and jewish scholars have differed on what jewish communities should do when their members are kidnapped and held hostage. On one side, there is the belief that ransoming lives from the kidnappers is the highest jewish value, no matter what the cost. On the other side, there are those that believe if the ransom is too high, it will hurt the entire community and will create incentives for kidnappers to seize more jewish prisoners. Today, there are 134 kidnapped prisoners from Israel being held in Gaza for the past 213 days. 101 are believed to be still alive. 91 of them are israeli Jews and israeli Muslims. Eight are from Thailand, one is from Nepal, and one is from Mexico. Five are american citizens. We pray and hope for their release soon. Now let us pray for them. May the Holy one who blessed our fathers and our mothers bless, keep and protect those that are in dire straits and in captivity. May the Holy one have compassion on them. Bring them out from darkness and despair, break their chains and from their depths redeem them and let us not forget them. May God return them quickly to their families. Let them realize the fulfillment of the verse, those redeemed by God shall return and come to Zion in Saul and anguish and moaning shall depart. And let us all say amen. Amen. Thank you, Alan. Appreciate that. We begin tonight with five proclamations, the first of which is for school nurse day. And this was requested by Jordan Drain, president of the Iowa School nurse organization. And we are asking, and we have several nurses with us today, Jordan Drain from Mark Twain Elementary, Meredith Ortega from Neil Armstrong Elementary, Carol Harris Lingang. I hope I said that right at Grant Wood Elementary, Jenny Hanson from Pleasant View Elementary, Kim Zupanik from Forest Grove Elementary, Stacy Schick from Pleasant Valley, and Joette Strobe. I hope I said that right. From Pleasant Valley. If you could all join me here in the center of the room, I'd like to deliver a proclamation from the office of the mayor. Please come on up. This is half our audience. The most proclamations ever for the city of Bettendorf in my tenure, and the most to receive a proclamation. Sorry. Great to see you all. Thank you all for being here. We appreciate you and all you do. Therefore, I have a proclamation from the office of the minute. Whereas all students have a right to have their physical and mental health needs safely met while in the school setting, and whereas school nurses are professional nurses that serve on the front lines, understanding the link between health and learning and are in a position to make a positive difference, providing support for children every day and have been ensuring students academic successes for more than 120 years. And whereas, school nurses act as a liaison to the school communities, families and healthcare providers on behalf of children's health by promoting wellness and improving health outcomes for our nation's children and our members of school based teams, for instance, school health services, or 504, IEP plans, disaster or emergency plans, they provide care to address the school population. Now, therefore, I, Robert Gallagher, the mayor of the city of Betty, North, Iowa, do hereby proclaim May 8, 2024, as school nurse day in our community. And I encourage all citizens to celebrate our nurses, our school nurses, and express gratitude for all that they do to keep our children safe and happy all year long. So, congratulations. Who wants to say a few words on behalf of school nurses Day, May 8? Please come on up. Hello. Good evening. My name is Jordan Drain. I'm the school nurse at Marco elementary. I'm also the president of the Iowa School Nurse organization. On behalf of the school nurses that are part of the Bettendorf Community School District and Pleasant Valley Community School District, we would like to thank you, Mary Gallagher, for honoring the work that school nurses do day in and day out, not just tomorrow, but year round.

I'm going to come over to the ice cream social on May 13, to say hi and redeliver this to those who really matter, those who are staying there, who get your care. So thank you very much. Thank you, Mitch. We appreciate it. I do have a proclamation from the whereas the week of May 12 through May 18, 2024, has been designated as national skilled Nursing Care Week, an observance that honors the dedicated care provided in skilled nursing centers across the nation, including right here in bettener. And whereas, this year's theme, radiant memories, a tribute to the golden age of radio, celebrates the rich tapestry of stories and experiences of those who reside and work within skilled nursing care centers, recalling an era cherished by many of our community's elders. And whereas, skilled nursing care providers play a pivotal role in delivering compassionate care to the elderly and to individuals with disabilities, and the city of Bettendorf acknowledges and celebrates the invaluable contributions of the school nursing care centers and their staff to the lives and residents of the families.

Every day and live my life well. Thank you very much. Yep. Monday it is. All right. Now. We have a proclamation for River Cleanup day, May 18, 2024. Okay, I'll just stay with a coffee that hydrates me so I have to drink warmer. This is a proclamation requested by Ivan Consulting. This proclamation will be received by Bree Collier, the CFO of the Quad Cities Chamber of Commerce. Come on up, Brieta. They both work just fine. I've just known you as Brie. I know. Forever. I do have a proclamation. And this is something that we've all worked on through Mr. CTI. And the work of that entity, combined with some of the folks here and some new work here by the Wilton Foundlea foundation. This is a proclamation from the office of the Mayor. Whereas since 1973, the United States has observed National River Cleanup Day of Action during May to promote river cleanups, and as a result, over 1.3 million volunteers have participated, removing more than 17 million pounds of trash from us rivers, and whereas, the Quad cities has unique geography. Excuse me, as a bi state region located on the Mississippi river, which has a vital source of drinking water, an important habitat for wildlife and plants, and a recreational and economic amenity, and whereas, in 2023, the Walton Family foundation, in partnership with Nyman Consulting and the Quad Cities Community foundation, formed the Clean River Advisory Council to inspire all community members to seek to create a more inclusive conservation community, bring awareness to its Mississippi river equity vision, and to highlight the importance of a zero pollutant mindset and wheReas, the proactive measures taken by the city of Pettorf recognize the importance of the Mississippi river and are committed to highlighting the importance of a zero pollutant mindset. Now, therefore, I remember Gallant Iowa, do hereby proclaim May 18 as river cleanup Day in the city of Betel and commend its observance by all citizens. You're here. Thank you. Please. You have the floor. Yes. Thank you very much, Mayor Gallagher, city council and members of the city, we appreciate the support. Obviously, we are a region that has a beautiful river. We want to keep it clean. We appreciate the commitment of the city to be not only a premier city, but to help this river remain a premier river as well. So thank you.

And for that, we have our public works director, Brian Schmidt. Brian, thanks for being here. Yearly received this proclamation from the office of Amir for all the good work of your folks in public works. Whereas public work services provided in our community are an integral part of our citizens everyday lives, and whereas, the support of an understanding and informed community is vital to the efficient operation of public work systems and programs such as sewers, streets, solid waste collection, and the numerous other services provided by this department, and whereas, the efficiency of qualified and dedicated staff is essential for our community to meet needs of our citizens and to provide the highest quality services that Bettendorf has the reputation for consistently providing. And whereas, the year 2024 marks the 64th annual Public Works week sponsored by the American Public Works association. Now, therefore, I, Robert Gallagher, the Mayor of the City of Edworth, Iowa do hereby proclaim May 18 as Public Works Day and May 19 through the 25th as Public Works Week. And I ask all citizens to equate themselves with our public work staff and operations and to take great pride in the excellence of service provided by their outstanding public works department. You're here. Thank you, your honor. Thank you for all you do on behalf of the men and women at CIR public works. We really thank you. To kick off National Public Works Week, we are going to be hosting once again National Public Works Day on May Saturday, May 18 from nine to one up at the Benton Public Works facility located off the Devil's Glen right behind the post office. This is a great opportunity for us to energize and educate the public of all the great things that our public works department does for our community. Snow plowing and streets just like you mentioned, your energy. It's always been a great day to see how many people come to this event. Last year we had over 400 people attend this event. We have trucks and equipment on display for the kids and adults to climb on, activities for the kids. We have bounce houses cleaning, snow plow painting, interactive displays, educational opportunities. But most importantly, we serve free lunch for everybody. It's from nine to one, Saturday, May 18. So please join our team and thank all the public work staff that will be there serving lunch for all the services that they do for our city. Thank you very much. Hey Brian, what's new this year? I forgot to mention. Thank you, your honor. This year we decided to do something different where we kind of threw a name or through a contest out there for a recycling truck naming contest. We had overwhelmingly support for that and decided to add two more trucks to be named this year. So the mayor will have the pleasure of naming these trucks or announcing the winners of the names of these trucks on public works day. So it's kind of a neat little event. We've had so many people, I think we've had over 4500 respondents on this, so it'll be kind of a cool thing and we're always looking for different ideas and whatnot. So if you guys have any other ideas to share with us, please let us know. All yours. Yes, sir. Thank you. Well done, Angie. What are some of the names of the recycled trucks? Recyclosaurus, Rex and my favorite, Ben Diesel, quoting us, open through Saturday on our website. The first one was overwhelming for a young guy who lost his live reading, so that's a doubt. Okay. Our last proclamation was requested by Clarence Anthony, the CEO and executive director of the National League of Cities here to accept the award on behalf of Clarence Anthony, who could not be with us tonight. Doctor plain. Thank you, your honor. Thank you. I do have a proclamation on behalf of the city of Bettany for the National League of Cities. Whereas the National League of Cities was founded in 1924 in Lawrence, Kansas, probably in the wheel, if you've been to Lawrence, you gotta go to the wheel. As the American Municipal association by state municipal League, seeking more coordination and national representation as cities, towns and villages expanded rapidly, and whereas, the nonpartisan national League of Cities is the oldest and largest organization representing municipal governments throughout the United States, representing the interests of more than 19,000 cities, towns and villages across the country, and whereas, today the National League of Cities works in partnership with 49 state municipal leagues, including ours, here across the country, to strengthen local leadership, drive innovation, and influence the federal policies that impact local programs and operations, and whereas, as the voice of cities, towns and villages in Washington, DC, the National League of Cities has successfully championed federal legislative solutions that support municipalities.

He was mayor for 24 years. And then in 2014, he became the executive director. He was named the executive director of the national and moved from Florida to DC.

I can't wait to call Clarence and tell him that this $10,000 that he owes us for this proclamation. One, two, three. Very good. All right. Thank you. Yeah, we do appreciate y'all coming for those proclamations. Very important stuff. Great things happening in our community, as always, and I do appreciate. Counsel, give me a little leeway to make those proclamations, excuse me, happen for great things happening in our community. We've now come to public request of counsel. If there's anybody here who wishes to be heard on an item not already on tonight's agenda for a public hearing, of which there's only one, you may be heard by approaching the podium in the back. Please state your name. We'd like to hear from you. First. We need your name and address, and we'd ask you to limit your comments to a few minutes. And please try not to be repetitive and refrain from any outburst. Anybody here wish to be heard on an item not already on tonight's agenda for public hearing? All right, we'll close the public hearing. Let's move. Sorry, we're closing public request of counsel, which is a public hearing, but we're moving to a different sort of public hearing. Michelle, did we publish notice of this public hearing? Yes, we did, your honor. I do have affidavit of publication. Did we receive any written correspondence with regard to this? No, we did not. Let's open our public hearing with regard to our fiscal year 2025 application for state transit assistance funds. We had some great discussions about this at our last meeting and then again yesterday. Council's up to speed. Anybody wish to be heard on this item? All right, let's close the public hearing and move to the resolution. Council member adamson, please. Thank you, your honor, I have a resolution approving the fiscal year 2025 application for state transit assistance funds for transit systems operations in the estimated amount of $252,710. I move approval of the resolution second. We do have a motion a second. Any discussion here? Michelle, would you please call the roll? Jagger? Aye. Sexer? Aye. Baden? Belchinsky? Adamson? Aye. Brown? Aye. All right, that resolution unanimously passes. Brian, make your application. We move to a first reading of an ordinance. This is about stop signs or yield signs. Councilmember jagger, please. Thank you, your honor. Your honor, the council letter on this matter indicates that the applicant was doing so on behalf of a disabled child who frequently uses the intersection in question. In my opinion, that raises the level of urgency for the appropriate passage of this ordinance. Therefore, your honor, I'm going to make a motion to move to waive the three readings of the ordinance. I will first bring the ordinance to the council's attention and then to make that motion, if that's all right with the. With the. Yes, I'm hearing you wish to make a motion. Waive the rule. The second and third reading? Yes, your honor. Is there a second for that? Second. Okay, michelle, did you get the person who seconded it as three? Seconded, basically the same time. A photo finish, like race horses, maybe. All right, we have a motion in a second, Michelle, but always go alphabetical. Michelle, would you please call the roll on the motion to wave readings two and three? Jagger? Aye. Sexer? Aye. Baden? Aye. Pelczinski? Adamson. Brown? Aye. All right, we have waved the second and third readings and moves to the first and final reading. Councilmember Jacob? Yes, your honor.

Welcome to the city of Bettendorf for our special city council meeting here for the presentation of our fiscal year 24 25 proposed budget. Michelle, would you please call the roll? Adamson. Here. Brown. Here. Jagger. Here. Nauman. Here. Sexer. Here. Baden. Here. Palczynski. Here. All right. Thank you all for joining us. And now we will turn over our presentation to our city administrator, Mister Decker Plain, and our director of finance, Mister Jason Schatt. Gentlemen, thank you for all of your hard work, as well as the department heads and the staff in finance, for putting together a budget that covers those priorities that we went through in our strategic planning session and listens to the public and their desire to have continued increase in fire protection services, as well as the other things that you guys have done. So thank you very much for your esteemed colleagues, for great work. You have the floor. Tell us what you did. Thank you, your honor. Why don't I start off? Your honor. So our budget presentation that we did back in February outlined what we're going to do with $118 million across all of our funds. We, as you know, this format tonight is different than what we've had in the past. This is a requirement of the state now to have additional public hearings. And we have people in the crowd, which is, I think, part of what that whole process was about. So we're glad that they're here so they can hear what we're going to be doing. But this, it demonstrates our financial strength and our flexibility. It responds to an extraordinary decrease in the rollback that we've never seen before since 1979, legislative property tax reductions and the challenge of our soaring costs that we talked about with you in our work session. This really concentrates on strengthening our commitment to public safety. It secures the funding long term of the safer grant, which, as you know, we received a $2 million grant to fund six firefighters. But that's only for a three year period. And what we have to do to honor that grant is agree that we will fund those positions on infinitum. And so we told you at the time of the budget that we thought that would require at least $0.36 over a three year period. And our budget recommends that we made a presentation to you that we could do that over three years or we could do it all at once. And the recommendation now is to try to accomplish that all at once. All of the firefighters have been hired. They are not all on board yet, but we are staffing now all three stations with a minimum of three and usually four so twelve guys per shift? Twelve people per shift. Since we hired a new female firefighter last week as part of the hires, and that is the primary focus of this. We'll go into. There are a couple other positions that we're adding, and the proposed levy rate then is $13.11 per $1,000 or $0.46 in the 24 year fiscal budget. I think it's important to note that that $0.46 was either going to take place in this budget or it's going to take place over three budgets. But either way, it has to take place to honor the safer grant in order for us to. We agreed we would accept that funding. And when we did that, we said we would guarantee that the firefighters would be with us forever. So it was either going to be over a three year period or over a one year period. And the recommendation now is to do it over a one year period. I'm going to turn it over to Jason. He did all of the work, as you know, and they did all of the work to get us ready for here. And then we could talk about the impact to individual properties, because there are some differences that occur through property assessed valuations that have changed that cause it to, for some people, about 35% of our community, they'll actually see a property tax reduction and about 65% could see a property tax increase. So let's have Jason walk you through all the things that we did to get here. Thank you. Talk loud because not everybody can hear you. All right? Yes, we are at nearing the culmination of what has been about a six month process so far in formulating this budget. My first introduction to the department heads and for their input on the budget happened last September. We went through council's goal setting in October. We've been through several budget work sessions on capital and operating through November, December, January and February. So there is a lot of work that has taken place to get us to where we are. As Decker said, the proposed levy rate, which we will hold the public hearing on tonight, is $13.11 per increase over the current year's budget. However, I want to really reiterate that the levy rate is just one component of three in the calculation of a property tax bill, and an increase in the levy rate does not necessarily equate to an increase in property taxes on an individual property. And we'll talk through that with a couple of slides going forward.

And we'll talk through that with a couple of slides going forward. As Decker introduced the 46 cent increase, funds fully funds six firefighters that are now being paid for with a safer grant. But come three years from now we will need to have them fully funded within the budget. In order to do that, you need $0.36 over the next three years. You can do it all at once or you can do it over three years. I think the recommendation right now is to let's grab that all at once. We also added an additional dime to take us to $0.46. So what do you get for $0.46? Well, first you get the fully funded firefighters. That was important to us all. We have some upgrades, three upgrades of officers to sergeant in the police department. Again, that commitment to public safety. We're going to add a full time fire marshal, a separate position, separate from firefighter. Again, commitment to public safety. We'll also add some staff at the library and bring back the parks director position that has been kind of absorbed through the culture and recreation director position for the last few years. So those are new additions. We also provided funding for previously existing positions that were already funded in the budget. Building maintenance tech and exhibit tech and public, public relations assistant in our communications department. So as I said, that requires $0.46 on the levy rate. That's an increase in the levy, not necessarily an increase in an individual person's tax bill, but certainly up for consideration tonight. Bettendorf remains among the most affordable when you look at the cost of owning an average home in comparable cities, and I have about 21 cities here on the chart, all with populations of 24,000 or more around the state of Iowa. If you take away the debt service levy and look at operating costs alone, Bettendorf is the lowest cost among the comparable group. So I think that's important to point out. I think we provide an incredible level of service and a great value for citizens for the cost that we ask of them. This is how the levy rate will change from the current fiscal year. In this second column in the table. I do have in the middle column there the plus $0.22. That was the scenario where we tried to piecemeal in the safer grant funding over three years. But to the far right we'll see the plus forty six cents. The city can levy taxes in a couple of different ways. First is the general fund, and we levied $7.80 there in the current year. The property tax legislation that was passed and adopted last year actually will automatically reduce our general fund levy each year depending on how our property values grow. So the general fund levy will be reduced to 765. But we can come back and make up for some of that loss through some of these other levy rates. We can levy for health insurance, we can levy for life liability insurance, the police and fire, pension, transit service. And then obviously our debt service levy at 485. That helps to fund all of the capital projects that happen throughout town. So in total, we'll be moving from 1265 to 1311. Council pass the budget with a 46 cent increase. The impact on a residential property. And I'll draw your attention to the bottom table here. The top table is at $0.22, but we're talking $0.46 tonight. There are really three levers involved when we are calculating a properties tax bill. And it starts off with the assessment that happens basically a year ago, 18 months ago, assessed values in Bettendorf on average increased about 17% for a residential property. And that factor alone would have increased an average mean valued home valued now at 318,000. That increase in valuation would have increased their taxes by about $317. But then there's the second factor, and that's the residential rollback, which is dictated by the state. The rollback was reduced from 54.65% in the current year to 46.34% for the budget year. So we're only going to tax 46% of that growth. Taxable value on the average home. In Bettendorf, the average existing home actually decreased by about 1%. So you're taxed on less of the home, less of your home's value than you are in the current year. That basically wiped away all of the increase from valuation. So the rollback takes away dollar 335. So we're about at zero. And then our levy rate change is the third and final factor in the calculation. If we increase forty six cents to thirteen eleven, that would add $66 to this tax bill. So the net increase on this average home, which is valued at $318,000, is about $48 or 2.6% for the year. And it funds all of those things that we talked about, especially those important things in public safety. However, I would also point out that many, as Deckard mentioned, will pay less. About 35% of our residential properties will pay less taxes. And it all has to do with not your valuation, but how much of your valuation increased or changed from the year before. So those that saw an increase of about 15% or more are likely to pay a little bit more. If your property increased less than 15%, you're likely", "answer_v2": "[\n{\n\"name\": \"Bettendorf City\",\n\"positives\": [\n\t\"Fully funded six firefighters with a safer grant.\",\n\t\"Upgrades of three officers to sergeant in the police department, showing a commitment to public safety.\",\n\t\"Addition of a full-time fire marshal position, separate from firefighter.\",\n\t\"Funding for staff additions at the library and reinstating the parks director position.\",\n\t\"Providing funding for previously existing positions in the budget (Building Maintenance Tech, Exhibit Tech, and Public Relations Assistant in communications department).\",\n\t\"Bettendorf remains among the most affordable cities in Iowa.\",\n\t\"Lowest operating costs among comparable cities in Iowa with populations of 24,000 or more.\"\n],\n\"negatives\": [\n\t\"Increase in the levy rate from 12.65 to 13.11, which could potentially increase the property tax burden on some residents.\"\n],\n\"decision\": \"buy\",\n\"comment\": \"The city of Bettendorf demonstrates strong fiscal responsibility and commitment to public safety and community services.

We have a pretty handy tool available on the website and I think we'll be happy to share it here tonight. You can punch in your address, it'll take you to a page that looks, has this in the bottom left hand corner. It's a property tax estimation tool specific to your address. If you put it in there and it just shows you what your taxes are for the current year at 1265. Now, these are city taxes only. We all know the schools levy taxes, the county levies taxes. There's a couple of other minor taxing entities that create your tax bill. So city taxes only. And you'll see the change year over year at the different levy rates. This particular house is at $1,577 in property taxes in the current year with a 46 cent increase that would go up just about $17 to 1594 for the following year. And then this is just where we are in the current budget calendar. We have done our informational meetings. We've done our Saturday budget workshop. We had a special meeting presenting the budget to the public. We've made notification of this public hearing and we are holding it tonight. There will be notification of a second public hearing going out next week. And that final public hearing will take place on April 16. And that is where council will finalize and adopt the budget and the levy rate. There's actually no council action necessary tonight other than to hear what the public has to say. I'm asking him to pull up that slide comparison to the other. Your slide. My slide. My favorite slide. Your slide. Oh my golly, it's in here somewhere. There you go. 17%, if you haven't done the math, to move to Davenport. So what we've done here is just taken that mean Bettendorf home, the $318,000 home and placed it in a couple of cities around the Quad Cities. So from the top to bottom, you have a city of Bettendorf, Bettendorf schools. Now these are total taxes, including city, county schools and everything else. Total taxes today, not with the increases, about $5,450. If you're in the pv district, you pay just a little bit more. 5635 again, current year. That same home in Davenport, in the Davenport school district would pay $6,616. So $1,200 more than bet. North, Bent, north and Moline, $9,118. And in rock island, over $10,000. So we often hear the critique that taxes are high in Bettendorf. And I think this just goes to show that that's not necessarily true. It's all dependent on property values and things of that nature. Jason, you're using slides from the state of the city address. Where could we find these slides? If we were interested in viewing them. I believe they're all available on the city's website. You can see a video of the state of the city on the city's YouTube channel. And you can. There's a link on our website to get to that, too. Perfect. Yeah. So just go to the website. You'll find all of this stuff. I saw some folks taking pictures, and they can just pull it up on their phones right now. Perfect. Anything else you wanted to add, gentlemen? Not for us, your honor, unless the council has questions for us. You've been through this a couple of times with the budget work session that we did on Saturday in February and the public notices and public meetings that we've had so far. Unless the council has a specific question for us, we did not choose to go into the 40 slides or 50 slides that we did during the budget session. We just thought that would be too much for people's eyes would blaze over, I think. So hit the highlights. And we appreciate that. So, any questions? I look to my left. Questions from council. All right, questions from council. Nick, do you have a question? Okay, then let's move to our public hearing. Michelle, did we publish notice of this public hearing? Yes, we did, your honor. And I do have affidavit of publication. We did receive a couple emails that everybody has seen. Any other written correspondence with regard to this public hearing? No, and those correspondence weren't with regard to the public hearing, but they were on point for the issue. Okay, let's open the public hearing. If there's anybody here who wishes to be heard on this item, you can do so by approaching the podium in the back. We'd like to hear from you. Please try to be respectful in your comments and refrain from any outbursts. If you would like to tell us what you think about the budget as presented, we'd like to hear from you. Please state your name and your address before your comments. We are open. Go to the back podium. Yep, the back podium. And if you'd like to speak and you want to kind of move that direction now, it looks like we have our first speaker. That way you can be ready to go as soon as his comments are finished. Thank you. I only hope I'm in the 35%, but that doesn't change my message here. Okay, we can take a look. Let's have your name and address first. My name is John Prieto.

I reside at 1360 Kimberly Ridge Road, Bettendorf. And I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak. While it's understandable that our city, as our city grows, so does the need for services, especially for the firefighters and police. But unlike the city, the residents do not have the option to tax others to help pay our bills as they rise due to consequences beyond our control. It's been reported through national statistics that over 60% of our nation's citizens are borrowing against their credit cards just to stay afloat. Many of those citizens are our neighbors here in Bettendorf. All of us in this room are charged with the responsibility to live within our means concerning our household budgets. When our costs go up, we are forced to make cuts, especially those of us who did not have the option to go out and find another job to make ends meet. I urge the city administrators to diligently look for ways to make our tax dollars stretch and institute other cuts in the budget before asking residents to produce money we cannot afford. If actions have already been taken, I ask we at least share the burden and lower the proposed hike that's being proposed. Thank you. Thank you, John. I appreciate it. Anybody else wish to be heard? Come up and give some comments for a couple of minutes. We'd like to hear from you. Name and address first, please. My name is Matt Mead and I live at 3624 Greenbrier Drive. I know there are a lot of numbers being thrown up here. They look minuscule. So much per $1,000, so much per $100. But when you have a parent like my mother over here that owns her home and sees nothing but increase after increase year after year in her tax dollars and her income doesn't change, it doesn't continue to go up, I feel that the city is putting people at risk on the edge of their stairwells and trying to kick them somewhere else. And I don't think that is in the best interest of any city or town or people in general. It seems like a little, but it seems like a little every year after year after year. And I think there are other things that the city can do along with businesses to help relieve that burden from those at risk of being out of their homes due to restricted incomes. Thank you. Thank you, Matt. Anybody else wish to be heard? Glenn, hey, good evening. Glenn Dugan, 5736 Butterfield Court. Just a question, out of curiosity, if anyone knows, we all see a lot of homes going up in Bettendorf, a lot of homes. And a general question of do we know what kind of percentage increase in property tax revenue there is, let's say last year. This compared to the increase in percentage wise of city costs to run the city. Any idea how they compare? So I will start just a minute and let you kind of gather your thoughts. We are averaging about 150 or more single family or duplex homes each year. That growth is awesome. But the problem is last year's change from the state legislature allows us to capture only a small portion of that growth. It's a complicated formula and this year I think we're just under 3% of the allowable growth able to capture. That doesn't, in my opinion, get us to paying for those services. But Jason, if you want to take a stab. No, thank you. Your honor. I don't know if I can answer the question directly, but I'd love to talk more. We do know in relation to that growth, usually the growth makes up between 50 and 80% of the new tax dollars each year. So new tax dollars from or new tax dollars from existing property is really a very small portion of the total new dollars that come to the city. I hesitate to throw a percentage at you tonight, but certainly something I can get for you. Follow up. It sounds like the expenses to run the city are outweighing the percentage of revenue gained from new construction. That's correct, yes. By is it comparable? Double. Any idea? No. I again, like if you know, new property taxes from existing property makes up maybe 20% of the new revenue. Thank you. Hi, I'm Teresa Schenck and I live at 3508 Greenbrier. And thank you for your question because that was really pretty much my question as well because we do have new homes going up, therefore more taxes coming in. However, I'm wondering about other businesses. I know sometimes businesses are allowed to come in and not pay taxes for a while. So I'm wondering how much of that is happening. And also I'm reading recently about people are concerned about the drivers and this is a very small thing so it's not going to make that great of a difference, but money being spent on a social media campaign rather than actually enforcement of our laws for drivers that are speeding and driving recklessly around town. So I mean, I think that there are a lot of things bettendorf does for us and I appreciate a lot of what is done, but I'm just thinking that there are other things that we might look at to pull back some of that money that may not be going for the best, being used in the best way. So that's my comment. Thank you. Do you have the list of the things here? Yes, we do.

For public hearing, you can approach the podium, state your name and address. Okay, we'll close the public hearing. And in response to let's see if we can cut, we also, as a council, pose that question to staff, department heads and finance. And this is the response that we received. And Jason, why don't you walk us through kind of some of the things that you all have done in an effort to at least maintain, if not reduce costs and find efficiencies. Sure. And this is not a complete list, but it's about as much as one can fit on a PowerPoint slide, even in a small font. But we do a lot of things, and cost reduction is, and cost efficiencies are always on the mind of everyone at that table, interns and seasonal staff, rather than filling, you know, taking on regular or full time staff so we can kind of flex up and down as, as the demand is needed. We have closed facilities. Family museum and the library are now closed on Sundays. We do, you know, native Nomo areas and parks and at the golf course, reduce chemical applications to save a lot of money there. A lot of virtual training opportunities, which is kind of a good result from the pandemic, is there's ample opportunities for training and learning remotely. Again, web based training, one to one devices is an IT initiative that we've taken on over the past couple of years to reduce the number of it assets that we have per employee. We have automatic aid agreements with other fire departments to get the help we need in the event of a major incident. We are constantly looking at ways to save money in the employee benefits area. We've moved our pharmacy insurance administration to Wellmark to take advantage of some better discounts. We have a wellness committee that's looking at the plan all the time and finding ways to enhance, enhance the plan while reducing costs in public works. I think there's some really cool things around snow removal that maybe aren't that exciting, but our liquid snow and ice control has saved many, many tons of solid salt being used on the roads at a pretty expensive rate. We have added mid mount wing plows so that the plow trucks can actually cover more road in one pass and can get more done in less time. We've done a lot of led lighting. We've done h vac work to get rebates. Our buildings are very energy efficient. There was a lighting project at the Waterfront convention center, which the city owns. Initial quotes for initial estimates for completing that project were about $750,000. Brian and his team got on it and got it done for, I think, less than $150,000. So we are constantly working to reduce costs and find ways to get the valued work that I think we do done for as least expensively as possible. Put this line up about the soaring cost. Your honor, there's a slide that we showed you in the. The budget scenario about. One of the gentlemen mentioned the budgets that they're stuck with, with frozen incomes. These are the costs that have changed since COVID on equipment that we have to buy to perform our operations. So, in 2010, we bought a single axle dump truck for 96,000. We're replacing that today at $237,000. That's after Brian has taken the box off the chassis and ran that. A number of those trucks are now in their 15th or 16th year. We've extended the life on almost every one of our vehicles with the vehicle committee to try to get better costs. We're replacing a 2015 pickup. They're now $60,000 pickup with a dump truck, about 115,000. The sewer vectors, we have two of them. We bought them ten years ago for $320,000. They're now $650,000 apiece. As you know, we have a fire apparatus that we're replacing. We bought it 23 years ago for $580,000. It's now at $2 million. And we had to pay some of that upfront, and we won't get it for another three years. Three. Three years. So these are when folks talk about the costs that we're associated with, these are the kinds of things that we're facing. Our liability coverage has gone up, and we're going up about 25% to 30%. Our health insurance, even though we're managing it much better, about 20%. And we've secured four year contracts with our bargaining units in the 3% range when 5% was the going rate. So our vehicles and our equipment are exceeding 10%, at least annually. And these, in order for us to do these tasks, we need this equipment to make that happen. So we all talk to you about the cost of outfitting the firefighters or the police officers. Each one of the radios that the police and fire carry are roughly $5,000. Fortunately, in our partnership with Scott county, we're now part of that consortium, and the county bought the radio system with us so that they've picked up that cost. But those are the kinds of cost increases that we've encountered. So these are part of the problems we had, is we created the budget.

But those are the kinds of cost increases that we've encountered. So these are part of the problems we had, is we created the budget. How do we buy all these pieces of equipment to do the things we have to do. Again, those sewer vectors are now ten years old. The life on those is about ten years. We'll try to stretch that until they start to really nickel and dime us, but that, those are what the costs that we're kind of replaced and stuck with. So anything else from you two gentlemen on your presentation? I would just encourage everybody to visit the website, check out the different slideshows and videos we have on the budget and punch your address into that calculator and see how the levy rate change affects your property. Because, again, an increase in the levy rate does not necessarily equate to an increase in your tax dollars. And we'd be willing, your honor, we'll stick around afterwards and we'll punch in everybody's address who's willing to give it to us and show them what that change is right here so they can understand what the impact to them is on city taxes only. We can only speak for our city taxes. And again, with a couple caveats. We don't know if they filed for their homestead exemption. We don't know if they're veterans, those sorts of individual play, but we can give them a pretty good calculation of what the $0.46 does to their individual property. That would be probably on the high side, because you're right, you're not in the calculator. It doesn't have the function to say the military tax credit or the. So you know it's going to come down if you're military, homestead and other credits that you get as a result of some of the legislation that increased those credits last year. Correct? I don't know if any council members have. Any council members that have questions? I have questions. Yes, sir. Thank you. Councilmember Nauman, how many cities in Iowa, if we know, roughly, were at the maximum levy going into this year? All but three. And now it's two, probably five or six. Yeah. Let me see if I have that in here. Not sure I have that slide. Can you explain that, too, for the public? So under the law, the maximum levy any city can have is $8.10 in their general fund. In their general fund, which is the main fund of the city and where police and fire function out of. So our levy rate a year ago was in the 572, 572 range. But because we saw what was going to happen at the legislature last year, we adjusted our levy rate up and moved everything into the general fund levy because of the growth factor cap that was going to occur at the state to try to give us the most dollars we could get by making that maneuver. Those cities that were at their 810 could not make that maneuver. And in some cities, like Davenport, for example, levees were taken away from them. The library levy rate and was it not transferred emergency levy, those were taken away by the state. So they're gonna have to either cut services or they found growth, perhaps in the commercial sector. I'm not sure how they've dealt with that, but almost every city is in a much worse position than we're in. We're able to be able to pick up those services. I'm not sure what they're gonna do. I think a point of pride for years, excuse me, of staff members requesting either personnel or equipment. And there's been a point of running the city of Bettendorf on a very lean manner. And there's. You're in a little bit of a paradox here because some of that leanness may now be coming back to cost us in one way, shape or form. Right. You're almost penalized for being a lean operation. That's exactly what happened. 100%. That's exactly what happened. Typically, like Glenn indicated, we would be potentially and probably in a position where if we were able to capture that growth, because I don't know how many cities are growing like 17, 18% like the city of Bettendorf is. I think that was a really great point that we discussed during our budget hearing, is left to our own devices. If local control were still present here, we'd be able to talk about how much we were reducing this levy. Is that fair? That would be very fair. So it seems like the state house is doing a one size fits all solution. And there are communities like Bettendorf who've been really lean that are now positioned where we're not able to capture growth. And we set a standard for service. Everybody loves the fact that we can drive through and not have potholes on every arterial and that the snowfall is cleaned, you know, virtually as it hits the ground. But that one size fits all. So it seems like state's looking good. Now. All of a sudden we've got to justify what we're doing and how we're doing. We're sitting here struggling to try to make those ends meet. And remember that the state eight years ago enacted a policy of taking all commercial residential property, that is apartment buildings over four plexes, where they were taxed at 90% of their value. They changed the way those properties were taxed and they're now taxed at the same rate as residential property, even though they're commercial ventures.

They changed the way those properties were taxed and they're now taxed at the same rate as residential property, even though they're commercial ventures. And I think that roughly cost us about a million dollars a year in revenue that from that switch. And that was from a lobby from the landlords association, primarily around the three university cities that were able to get the legislature to change those classification types. And obviously none of those rents were reduced. But those are the kinds of changes at the state level that have impacted our ability to deal with that growth and deal with those services. Right. Well, you know, and like Mister Mead said, others may not know, but my mom's at Thomas Place and she's 91 and a half and she is simply every increase, you know, they took away their bulk cable and every increase, 30 or $35 might as well be 3000 to her. So I'm funding a lot of those things and we feel every, every bill and I think this council collectively gets that too. That I think what I hope people, we're so grateful to see people in the room, hope people understand how hard it is to deliver a consistent level of service and do things that are not gratuitous and then even economic development. I think people have maybe a misunderstanding of how much, why are they giving money to TbK when in fact TbK maybe, Jeff, if now or in the future a long way, the economic engine that that's become so that we can garner some growth to try to fight every day to keep these services affordable. I think there's a lot going on and the dialogue can start today but certainly won't end. Yeah, I'm happy to oblige. Thank you, Councilmember Nama. So I'll give it, for example, next door we have the bridges apartments, for example, the bridges lofts. And I think everyone here has a historical perspective of the Twin Bridges Motor Inn and what it had become. And we were met with a developer there who chose to incur that property and demolish it and redevelop it into the site. Today there was a benefit to the city on a number of fronts. It cut our police and fire calls down by probably seven to 900 a year. We didn't have children going to our school district that were actually residing in that property, so there was the ancillary benefits. But the question is more relative to the contribution of tax dollars, if you will, or not allowing them or having them pay taxes in a scenario like that. The developer chose to take that project on, that burden on, if you will, demolish a property and redevelop it. He agreed to still pay the amount of tax taxes that were being paid the assessed value that was there. That gentleman chose to, through an agreement with us still pay that amount. So I believe at the time, the twin Bridges was assessed at about $700,000. And when that property owner paid his taxes, it would be on 700,000. That developer then, who came in, still paid the taxes on that amount of money, and then the city chose to rebate him any growth, any new taxable value, his tax dollars back. So, in a case like that, we saw the intangible benefits of having children, living in a healthier environment, less police and fire burden, and obviously, the fact that we created downtown living for new residents in Bettany, which is a great thing, but we rebated him back property taxes that he paid above the value that had been established there at the Twin Bridges motor end. And that's a very simplistic, quick explanation of how that works. We did the same where the lodge site was, a very similar type of agreement, because, again, that property became a nuisance property, and the end game, again, pay the base value. What was there is what they paid taxes on. Anything new that they created. There was a rebate provided to them because they took that on and created a new development there that generated more. Plus. Plus. Your honor, the debt service levy on that property gets paid what it generates, probably about $50,000 a year in additional taxes just from the debt service levy. Now much more expensive. Much more expensive. And the developer doesn't get to capture that. So that property is generating probably, let's say, $60 to $70,000 more than it did by virtue of the new development. And when fully developed and comes online, it'll pay taxes in the 25, $30 million range. So the city still gets. Even though the primary source of property tax is rebated to them, there's still a strong ancillary benefit to that kind of development, and it gives us such a quality development in our downtown compared to what was there. Right? Anything else? Okay, Mister Norman, I guess I do have a question about the rollback in the taxable value. And even if we didn't change the levy, it was my understanding that there wasn't really much of a. I mean, it seems like Netflix rates are going up more than what people would actually garner in tax savings, if I recall that. Right. Because of that rollback, which, again, reduced. Let's see if I can find a good slot. Maybe this is the one. So the rollback reduced taxable value so much that, like I said, on existing properties, not the new construction, but existing properties, taxable value was down about a percent on average.

And when fully developed and comes online, it'll pay taxes in the 25, $30 million range. So the city still gets. Even though the primary source of property tax is rebated to them, there's still a strong ancillary benefit to that kind of development, and it gives us such a quality development in our downtown compared to what was there. Right? Anything else? Okay, Mister Norman, I guess I do have a question about the rollback in the taxable value. And even if we didn't change the levy, it was my understanding that there wasn't really much of a. I mean, it seems like Netflix rates are going up more than what people would actually garner in tax savings, if I recall that. Right. Because of that rollback, which, again, reduced. Let's see if I can find a good slot. Maybe this is the one. So the rollback reduced taxable value so much that, like I said, on existing properties, not the new construction, but existing properties, taxable value was down about a percent on average. So that alone would reduce a person's tax bill with no change to the levy? No, you know, but I think the slide we have here is taken together, all of these things that have come along from the state over the past ten or so years have reduced the percent of the taxable value as a percent of assessed value. We used to count on about 62% as taxable across all property types, and now that's down to 51%. It's equal to about $393 million in value or 3 million in potential property taxes. Not that we were going to go grab, but that were available to us just through the valuation. And to your earlier point, councilmember Naumann, we now have less opportunity to access that valuation because of the different mechanizations that the state has put in place to reduce valuation, no matter how much it costs. Thank you, your honor. Thank you, councilmember sexer. Thank you, your honor. As a follow up to the tiffs in the hotels, in addition, those new hotels are generating hotel motel tax, which the new hotels have far more hotel motel tax generated than the old lodge was generated for us. I mean, that's true based on what's going on at TBK. As you know, we had, we incented the property to demolish the old lodge or old jumers, and two new hotels are up there. And we do have more hotel motel tax revenue. We are getting more sales tax revenue. Our gaming revenue is actually pretty flat and we do not get any of the gaming revenue from online or betting. Sports betting legislature didn't allow us to change that. So our gaming revenue is slowly going down. So those have been some changes that have been both good and bad as we wrangle with all of this. Yes. Councilmember Jagger. Thank you, your honor. The last person who spoke to us this evening raised a point about a social media campaign, and I just wanted to respond to that for just a moment, if I could. The question was whether the city is spending $50,000 on a social media campaign. Campaign it's not. There was some confusion on a Nextdoor app about that where a person posted that the city was doing that, and it is not. When I've talked about social media campaigns, what I'm talking about is talking to people on the Nextdoor app, talking to people on Facebook, getting paper newspaper stories like what started all of that in the Quad City Times, getting stories on channel six or channel eight, having the mayor do a mayor's message on the need for people to be aware of traffic regulations and to obey traffic regulations that doesn't cost anything other than perhaps the mayor's time or staff's time to do the video for these kinds of things. The $50,000 is a grant from the state to pay for overtime for police officers to do more traffic enforcement. So for the people who say we aren't spending enough actual police time stopping speeders or stopping people who are running red lights or. A lot of the conversation dealt with people using the turn lane on these three lane roads of Forest grove or tanglefoot. For people who say that we aren't spending enough effort in that respect, that $50,000 is dedicated solely to that purpose. The city is not spending any money on social media. And I just wanted to make that clear because there was some confusion over the weekend. Thank you. Thank you, your honor. Councilmember adamson, did you have something? I thought you were getting my attention. He just took care of it. Okay. Councilmember Pausinski, did you have anything that you wanted to ask about? No. Thank you, your honor. I just appreciate all the steps, hard work on putting all this information together. This is, it's incredibly valuable for the council as well as the constituents. And I appreciate everybody joining today, even though I'm coming to you digitally. That's okay. We understand. Okay. Well, then, at this time, I'd like to entertain a motion to adjourn. Your honor, we will stick around and. Yeah, yeah. If anybody wants to put it in there, we won't put it on the screen. You just see it on your small screen, and you'll see if your taxes are going up or down or remaining about the same second. All right, we are adjourned. Good work, people. Thank you again.

Welcome to the board of adjustment for the city of Bettendorf. March 14, 2024. Meeting. Roll call, please. Gallagher? Yes. Spranger? Here. Tansy? Here. Tom Berks? Here. Vermillion? Here with full house. Everybody's here. The board of Adjustment is a five member board and there are five of us here tonight. And we are appointed by the mayor and we review certain matters that are properly before us, such as variances and special uses. We are normally prepared to review and vote on matters that come before us on the night they come before us. So the next item on the agenda is to review the minutes of our last meeting, which was February 15. You've all received those minutes. Do I have any additions or corrections? No. If not, I'll entertain a motion to approve the minutes. So move. I got a motion. A second. All those in favor say aye. Oh, same sign. The next item on the agenda. We deferred that from last month because there weren't too many people here. But now I have a full house is the election of officers. So I guess I'd open a nomination for chairman of the. Of the board. So I'll nominate you, Bob. I'll second that. To continue as the chairman. Okay. Anyone else? Any other nominations? Anybody else wants to throw their way? Clamoring please? Okay, I guess then there's been a motion in a second. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Okay, I guess. And now an assistant chair. I'm happy to continue in the role. Will you then I will certainly nominate you as the assistant chair. Second that. Second. Thank you. And all those in favor say aye. Okay, the next item is case 240. One four. It's at 60 21 Valley Drive. It's an I two. It's a variance to reduce the required landscape buffer yard from 30ft to 25. It's submitted by Greg French. Greg Beck's going to give us a report, I think. Please do, mister chairman. This location is right here off of Valley Drive and is a lot of record affiliated with the fields. Development edition is actually lot eight. This was platted at one time. It was one piece, and then there was a centerpiece, which we'll show later. It was planted as the second edition, which features this out lot. A request is to reduce the landscape buffer yard from 30 to 25ft in this area, which. But at the same time retaining the required 25 foot front yard setback and buffer yards in this area because it's declared a major street, Valley Drive requires that there be 30ft of landscape. The situation is petitioner wants to place this structure on this lot, it is seven contractor condominium units parking inside. The coverage here is only 24% of the entire lot. With the 10,300 square foot building, which is going to be 50ft wide, 206ft long, it meets and complies with all the standards as required by city code. Typically, there's no rear yard setback foundation in an I two district, but in this instance, there are areas back here in this blue area showing where the placement of sanitary sewer and also stormwater runoff, as well as storm sewer, which is dissipated in this area, is being facilitated. Because this is the lowest part of this lot. Water we're also trying to get through here is conveyed not only from this lot, but other lots. To go to this out lot a, which is a detention basin. The land use is pretty much industrial throughout anything south of Valley Drive. We were in low intensity land use further to the north, but this separation line has been here approximately since 1972, when this area en masse became zoned I two general industrial. This was I one and this was r two up here to the north and then to the northwest. And, as again in the landscape ordinance mentioned earlier, a 30 foot buffer yard is usually required between r1 and I two. One looks at the lot, they'll see that out front. Here's the approximate area of the property line. Here's a 25 foot setback, and here's 30. This lot is pretty well. It's filled right now and it has all the proper floodplain development permits. If you come back to the rear end portion of the rear lot line area, you'll see that this tapers off. It drops off down here. This has not been filled and this is a drainage area that conveys water over to this locale right here, which is that out lot a, which we want to facilitate. Also, the sanitary sewer connection is down in this area and then to drain the parking lot, we want to make sure that water comes down this direction and then is dissipated in this area before heading to out lot eight. So the designs are essentially, again, what is in some cases, pushing this building further to the north, because it makes more sense, the topography and the layout, to place those type utilities into the rear lot line area. This is the first edition of the Fields development edition. This is lot eight right here. This portion was not subdivided until later, but it was fields development, second edition, and an out lot eight is a regional detention mechanism was included in this area. Lot in question here.

This is the first edition of the Fields development edition. This is lot eight right here. This portion was not subdivided until later, but it was fields development, second edition, and an out lot eight is a regional detention mechanism was included in this area. Lot in question here. Lot eight has approximately one acre of ground, so it is not particularly a large lot, as one might think of some of these other lots within the industrial park. Staff in evaluating this particular setback request, found three affirmative and no negative rulings. One was a 6125 nearby Valley Drive. Parking was permitted within 2ft of the property line due to the topographic limitation. And that's what we have here. Topography is more favorable for certain utilities to be installed in the rear of the lot. 4465 53rd Avenue saw that parking was placed 5ft closer to the property line into what was the buffer yard. And then at 428 28 and a half street, the buffer yard was reduced from 30 to 5ft due to the lock configuration, again to fit in. Parking staff reviewing this case feels that there is a hardship based on topography, utility location and drainage facilitation, and based on those items that the petitioners request in this instance should be granted to reduce the buffer yard from 30 to 25ft on lot eight of fields development, first edition. I would ask, are there any questions, any questions from the board? Nope. Anyone in the audience wish to speak in favor of this application? Don't see any how, buddy. Anybody wish to speak opposed to it? Again, I don't see anyone. Okay, so what's the pleasure of the board? I'll make the motion to approve case 240. One four, allow the 30 down to 25 foot second. Okay, we have a motion in a second. Any discussion? How about a roll call vote? Gallagher? Yes. Spranger? Yes. Tansy? Yes. Homburgs? Yes. Vermillion? Yes. Okay, that passes. The next case is 24 oh 16. It's 3011 Devil's Glen Road. It's a c three and it's a variance to increase the allowable size of an off on premises. On premises identification sign from 107. It's submitted by Nicole Richards for Ace sign display. We have a report, mister chairman. This site used to be a car wash and it has since been removed, that car wash. And as you're seeing if you have passed recently through Devil's Glen, up Devil's Glen Road near Ivy, you do see that there is a new building underway. And that is the new car wash. It is 3011 Devils Glen Road. It is lot one of Arrowhead edition. And the request is to increase this approximately 70 signage that is on site. The land use is community commercial, as almost everything is around here. There's a public, semi public area here for housing. But other than that, pretty much everything is in tune with promotion of the zoning classes as they are c three and c two. In this instance, because a portion of this ground was c two, a special permit application was required in this body to approve that special use permit and as such, all signage on this site will be set back 20ft due to the setback requirements in c three zoning. This is the approved site plan showing two means of entry onto the lot. There's an area here where there is a driving area and that has somewhat pushed this building farther back. So there's better circulation in here to stack vehicles to come into the car wash and then have them exit. So that is something that necessitated a 74 foot setback from the property line. The signage is based off of a formula, essentially, and what it does, it looks at the lot width, which is 140ft in this case, and then it looks at that distance, which is 74ft. You combine the two of those, you come up with a figure of 214 total feet divided by two, and that would yield you the permitted signage based on the depth of the lot and the width. Typically, if that factor was not used in the past, prior to the ordinance update in 2017, this business could have had up to 300 on premise identification signage. However, the way the building is located, as you can see by this photo, this area here is the front of the building, but it's obscured by this building, by this tree and also the further back you go by signage and other buildings. So as you're approaching, this delineates right here, right as you would enter Burger King, about 225ft distance and you still can't see the area. The future sign for a potential pole sign is right about here where that might be placed. When you get to about the 80 foot mark, you can eventually see where the building is and you might be able to see the frontage where that signage is going to go. Or you may not. Again, this building has been recessed in order to create better circulation within the site.

From 400ft from the center line essentially right here of Maple Crest and on down to the south, you can essentially see probably approximately where the building protrudes here. Again, the signage is not totally within view, but the building is visible at that point. So what we're trying to do is remedy the situation with the signage. Given the setback of the building and for the traffic approaching from the south, there was no negative precedence found in this region surrounding for about half a mile this particular site. There were cases where extra signage was granted based on visibility and one was at 1207 Devils of Glen Road for the Eagle food stores, which is now used for computer and information data storage. Also at one time, 2011 Devil's Glen Road for the prior owner of the prior car wash to accommodate a change type sign, extra signage on that sign. And then that same case cited two other instances where Wallace's garden center and Hy vee also received variances for increased square footage for more visibility in their particular areas. Staff, from reviewing this proposal feels that there is a hardship given the obstruction for traffic approaching from the south and given the recessed nature of the building. So staff would support the increase in square footage of signage. Given the petitioner's request, I would ask her any questions. Any questions at all? No. Anyone in the audience wish to speak in favor of this application? Anyone wish to speak opposed to it? Don't be shy. Nope. Okay. So there's nobody opposed or in favor of it? What's your pleasure? I'll make a motion that we approve case 240, one six for a various variance in the square footage of the project to be completed there. Okay, I'll second that. Right. So I have a motion and a second roll call. Gallagher. Yes. Spranger. Yes. Hanse. Yes. Homburg. Yes. Vermillion? Yes. Okay. That one passes. The next one is case 2415. It's 5221 competition drive. It's a c three. It's a variance to increase the allowable height of an on premises identification signal from 20ft to 30ft. And it's submitted by Acme Sign Company, Inc. To. Everybody switch staff. Go right ahead. It's 20 415 is a 52 21 competition drive. It's a variance request. This is a newly developed lot just north of Forest Grove Drive and east of Middle Road. As mentioned, this variance is to allow a 30 foot sign height in lieu of the 20 foot sign height requirement. Code proposal is associated with an approved McDonald's restaurant highlighted in blue here, east of the current bedplex. And this will be just west of the iron t development. Zoning on this location is all very commercial. It is currently c three general business district commercial development. Developed areas are surrounding the proposed development to the west in all directions. The approved site plan shows the sign location. The sign is shown on the northwest corner of the parking lot, so shown in red. This will be. This is now the newly finished roundabouts at Middle Road. Competition is just near the corner and near the sidewalk. It is located outside the front yard. Setback. There's 20 foot setback in this district. Due to that, it's allowed to be the full height and have up to its maximum allowable square footage. We're just looking at the height of the sign right at this meeting. Proposed sign dimensions are shown. This is a pole sign type. A backlit logo would be top, would top the sign and either backlit panels or an led message board have been proposed for the lower part of the sign, but nevertheless the sign height is 30ft shown. Just to give you a. Since we didn't have any really good aerial due to the new development, this is the new island, as I call it. Here's competition drive, the new roundabout on competition in the middle and the new roundabout on middle and Forest grove. So that restaurant will be located right on a corner. So that'll have very good visibility. I will touch on the applicants comments for requesting this variance. The applicant states that their business would be at a advertising disadvantage due to the 20 foot sign height compared to a 30 foot sign height. Quickstar, which is located just across the street across Middle Road to the west, does have a 30 foot pole sign. This was probably one of the last allowed 30 foot signs before the 2017 ordinance lowered the allowed sign height from 30 to 20ft. So you see that sign? It's a Google street view for the roundabouts were constructed and is due west. The current code from 2017 on is 20 foot sign height. So I wanted to state that staff acknowledges the difference in standards due to the ordinance change in 2017, but cannot identify a particular hardship to the quest. In the context trading McDonald's site is on a corner, is at a corner adjacent to a major roundabout. The sign location. A lot will be very visible for vehicular traffic, especially since their travel speeds were reduced by the roundabout. Now, if there is more objective sign height code alternatives, say we're dealing with the code that was adopted in 2017, but if there's. This is a commercial area, residential areas are pretty far away. This probably would not be the body to do that with Stafford. Recommend the applicant propose a sign code amendment versus granting a variance. In this case, staff contends a request does not meet requirements for granting a variance, is recommending and recommends denial of the request. And I can take any questions. Question.

I drove out there and I forgot I got out there and I didn't go on 80 to see if there. If you can see the quickstar sign from as you exit. Yeah, that's. Or not. And I. I went out there, I drove around, but I didn't do that. What, probably interstate? Yeah. Well, from the exits, um. There are some. There's a difference in topography. Um. A little bit. You're going down. Yes. The actual distance. I know is. I know it's over a thousand feet. It's pretty far. Right. Um. But yeah. That we're. Staff really analyzed adjacent properties and adjacent. We have a major arterial road, right next to which is middle road. Competition is going to be. It's going to almost act like a collector, in a way, a commercial collector, especially once the development occurs. You'll have a future. If I go back to the layout, just to imagine all these new developments were approved in the last year. Yes. So adjacent to the proposed McDonald's is you'll have a hotel, four stories, I believe. Walk you through. These are all commercial units, multi unit commercial spaces. One story to the north, they'll have a two story ora facility. So that'll be with two story in height, pretty large building, 110,000 sqft. You do have very tall. Now, these aren't signs. This is. These are structures for the netting of the golf course to the east. We would not allow advertising on those structures. They would still have to meet our sign code. They're just. There's no lights actually that high either. The lighting is all mounted on the building facing, I think, second level. It's two story building. And then you have a. It's going to be very similar, almost identical indoor sports facility. Like a large pole building, it'll look very similar to the one to the west. And I think on this particular plan, there's a few buildings missing, but they're just one story, multi tenant commercial spaces as well. So it kind of gives you, if you're analyzing for instructions, anything of that nature, try to help you out with your decision. Thank you. Can you go ahead. Can you recap just in a sentence, why it went from 30 to 20 and 17? Staff's research, my research I was not able to identify. I think there was some comments from the council at that time, for lack of a better term, reining in that was proposed, but there was not a specific reason stated in the ordinance change and I was not here at that time. So as I said, with signs, it's slightly aesthetics, but it's also trying to. It's trying to protect property from different. Talk about light obstruction, property values, all those things. That's why zoning regulates signs. Trying to protect those things. Safety is also a big part. I don't think in this case a 30 versus 20 foot sign has a safety issue. If it's too low, that's when we get into our sight line distances. So monument signs sometimes are quite large and we have to. Even if it meets all of our code, if it doesn't meet that particular part, we'll have to move it back on a roundabout. When you have a, you know, multiple intersections, you don't want that to interfere. I don't think lighting in this case will be. It's first, it'll have some additional, I guess, illumination based on the height, but in this area, you'll have a lot of light. So. But addressing going through the board for a variance in this case, if we gave a variance for this specific structure, this request, we'd be happy going. This would set the precedents for going through all of these. Other staff does acknowledge that this. There's a kind of a difference here, but it's directly on the roundabout, that corner. It is on the roundabout. Say, if this were an interior lot or given that its location, I really don't. I feel it's staff's analysis feels that it's going to have very good views. Mister chairman Taylor and I talked a lot about this case, and I think the rule changed. It's clear it's not a scripter's error. It was intentional by the council to change that rule. We're the arbiters of their rules. We did look for hardship, and you can go down the road of what ifs, but there's not a hardship that we could find. Like, say, the. See, the netting was opaque, and the netting kept you from seeing the sign. Well, maybe that's a difference, or there was really tall buildings blocking it. The 2017 code made in 2017 made a change. So the variance has to be, per our law, has to be based on a hardship. We can't find a hardship in this case. If the position wants to challenge it and maybe suggest a text amendment to code, they could do that. There's a process for that, and we've encouraged them to go that route as well. But staff doesn't find a hardship. Any other questions? No? Anyone wish to speak in favor of the application? Yes, sir. Hello, my name is Austin Smith.

I'm purchasing this new Bettendorf McDonald's. I hope in the future to own all of the Bentondorf McDonald's once Joe Stanky retires. So hopefully I'm with you guys for a long time, and I don't mean to be a pain in the butt here, but I've been doing this for almost 20 years, and my parents have been doing this for over 40, and the larger road sign you have is just better for advertisement we've changed road signs in the past from ten foot to 20 foot and 20 foot to 30 foot, and it always increases sales. I want to be a part of this community. I want to be a, you know, benefactor of this community and be involved. And I feel like I'm at a disadvantage when one of my biggest competitors in Quickstar or convenience store gas station has a 30 foot sign and I'm only going to have a 20 foot sign. I feel like that's going to affect me. Not only that, but there's a huge hotel going on right next to me. There's strip malls behind me, and if I've gone back there and spent a lot of time out there, and if you walk back there, a 20 foot sign versus a 30 foot sign is so much more visible from the other side of those strip malls. And then they have those 150 foot. I know, I know you said there's a net there, but there's gonna be a lot of illumination. I don't know if you guys have ever played at a topgolf or something like that, but there's a lot of illumination that comes out of there. So from the other side, it's gonna be really hard to see. So also, when it comes to the light, we're not a 24 hours restaurant, you know, light. I know a lot of McDonald's are, but that's not my business philosophy. We close at 11:00 p.m. and we open at 05:00 a.m. and so I know Quickstar is an overnight business as well, so that lights on all night. And so I understand that there was a change in the rules, but I feel like that I will be at a disadvantage as a part of this community. As a business member in this community, I think that I should have the 30 foot sign. So I appreciate your time, and thank you. Thank you. Anybody else want to speak in favor of it? Yes, sir. I'm Craig Jarvis with Acme sign. And I came along here, actually, the design on the sign there, the red part, where the McDonald's arches are, is aluminum. And the only thing that's going to light up on the top of that is the golden arches itself. And down below, you see the three panels down below. Austin has not decided which one he's going to use, but from what I understand, that will not light up either. So the only thing that's really going to light up on this thing at night while he's there is the arches itself. So that's all I have to add. Besides being his own lot, you know, he owns that lot, period, where a lot of these other developments are multi tenants. This is his own lot himself, so he's trying to draw business into his. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else? Anyone wish to speak opposed to the application? See anybody there either? Okay. Any questions or from the board? No? Anybody have a motion they like to make? I did. I'm going to make the motion that we approve or deny the variance for case 24. Oh, 15. It sounds like, mark, you guys have laid out a path of a way that they can go a different direction. It just looks like our hands are tied by the code. Right. And just for everybody's edification, when we say hardship, I. We concede the point. There would be a hardship to the business. If you have a smaller sign, you get less business. That makes sense to me. The. The hardship that we have to follow for the law that we're interpreting here is a hardship based on the lay of the land, not caused by the developer himself. So, for example, something like topography or drainage, that would make it difficult to place the sign where you wanted to place it, those type of things. So maybe the path forward, if this vote's gonna go the way I think it's gonna go, would be for the petitioner to seek a text amendment change to our code and run that through a city council. That's another process. Staff hasn't analyzed that, so we. I don't know where we come out on it, but that's. That's another avenue to maybe more appropriately address this, because your decisions are based on a hardship of the land that would allow interference to occur. And a hardship of the land doesn't. Doesn't occur here, in my opinion. Certainly, I understand the hardship of, if I have a smaller sign, less people can see me, unless people are going to come to me. And I concede that point. I think that's fair, but that's not a reason you can use in making your decision today. Unfortunately, I would want to sign, too, if it was my business, but I absolutely not comfortable setting that precedent. That everybody's going to have a 30 foot sign then, if we'll. That's the problem. Yeah, and then they made. That was before Taylor and I's time here, but they made that decision for some reason, so they can reconsider. Okay. Okay.

And you might be able to craft some language that applies to a sign in that sort of situation versus a sign front of my house. I mean I know that says make sense but environment, yeah, different environments. Go ahead. I'm just curious of the Texas amendment. What's the time period on that? I haven't had this building built in 60 more days or 70 more days. It's not going to be that fast. You're going to have probably three readings. So you're going to have three council meetings to get that through. And I have to have the sign up because I don't know if you guys know this or if you've ever worked in restaurant business but it's hard to staff after Covid it's even harder to staff in this area. With the income level with as high as it is. It's even harder to staff kids. You know, I get a lot of my, you know, 16 1718 year old kids, kids going through college in that area. They just don't need the money like they do in other areas. It's just what it is. I've been doing this for a long time. It's going to be a super hard location to staff. I don't have the time to do the text or else I would. And from hearing you guys speak it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of reason for the 30 foot rule anyway. So you're saying that I should amend to get that text change, right? That would be the way it feels. So it just doesn't seem like there's a reason other than it's just a rule you don't want to change. I understand your difficulty position and I'm not trying to be difficult. And I know that other people might want a bigger sign now because I'm getting one and it's setting precedent. But I can't take that route because I have to have this building up. My open date is June 1. And if I don't have that sign where the people are going to see that and go apply for a job, I can't wait. I have to have the sign up. So. But should it change in the future, he could change out the sign to a larger sign in the future. Tens of thousands of dollars. That's an expensive. And I appreciate it. I appreciate what the situation is. But hopefully you can appreciate our set. We can't change the code is set. We just have to interpret the code and the code's there and that's kind of where we're at. So he just, he just made it to seem like there was no big deal. So if I went with the text amendment change, I could get it done. I just don't understand. We can't bypass that process if that's going to happen anyways. That's a legislative process of counsel. They make the rules. Not usually judicial boards they're looking at literally like measuring that while going through counsel. They change law and that really, that's the avenue under options.

It's a c one special use permit to allow a miniature golf course, and it's submitted by Craig Wagner. Thank you. Chair, 36 Tanglewood Road. A special use permit. Applicant is Craig Wagner, owner of the Tanglewood restaurant. The request is for specially used permit to allow a miniature golf course in the c one district. The site development plan proposes an 18 hole mini golf course with associated lighting, landscaping and artificial turf. For those that view, here's Danglewood looking on Devil's Glen and Tanglewood Road. Zoning for the area. Current zoning is c one neighborhood business district. A miniature golf course is defined, is defined as a commercial, recreation controlled impact use. And this use does require a special use permit in this district. It's permitted use in c two and c three. Surrounding developments include c one. So commercial and industrial to the north and then residential pud to the west. I will note there is one residential development that zone c one directly south. We have townhomes right here. So that's kind of hidden. Developments consist of civic uses, storage areas and residential townhomes. So we have the YMCA townhomes. We have a pv bus barn and public works, actually to the northeast. So the existing site is. Well, I should mention the existing outdoor uses at the Tanglewood include bar, patio, evening music events, yard games, fire pits. A meadow exists farther east where the proposed miniature golf course is proposed. City of Bettendorf owned property farther east contains a parking lot which is leased by the restaurant. The golf course would only be allowed in the restaurant property, so there's a site plan that shows it on that property that would need a change. This board is more looking at the overall use externality. It's not necessarily. There's a couple, a little two holes that over go over to that property so that need to be changed.

The golf course would only be allowed in the restaurant property, so there's a site plan that shows it on that property that would need a change. This board is more looking at the overall use externality. It's not necessarily. There's a couple, a little two holes that over go over to that property so that need to be changed. More analysis of the existing site. As mentioned, it has the parking lot to the east shown with 52 spots. That agreement that lease agreement only allows for parking. Other off street parking for the Tanglewood is provided the following locations. They have 145 spaces on their own property and they also have a shared parking agreement with the YMCA to the south and they have 277 spots per code analyzing all the uses there. So we have outdoor patio, we have music vent, we have general restaurant adding all that up. The venue now currently requires 372 spaces per our code. An additional 18 are required. For the miniature golf course, it's one per pole. So as mentioned, the meadow, you can see the overlay of the golf course layout. The meadow exists. Where the golf course is going is proposed. Fence is proposed to surround the miniature golf course, which would then be accessed. So the golf course would be accessible within the restaurant area. You have one entrance where the current entrances and then you would go farther east so it has some containment. Again, staff is recommending that the golf course be located completely on the restaurant property. That's more for the site plan phase. If approved by the board tonight, the overall increase in customers and intensity, staff will contend is small relative to the 1250 person occupancy of the existing site. So you have an 18 hole miniature golf course. We don't really have an occupancy calculation for that. Our parking says 18 cars, but we'll save four people per hole. That's pretty busy. You can kind of think of that as an added customer base, but that would also be, well, of music's going on. You'd have to think of all these events and these kind of altar. It's going to be kind of a background thing, another amenity to do. While it's nice outside, looking more at the rendering and the layout, noise from the miniature golf course is expected to be limited. This is especially true given relative to the existing uses present on the property. Compared to some of the events going on in the music, it's going to be much lower than that. There has been proposed. This isn't shown necessarily on here, but there might be some music with, I guess you'd say landscape speakers and rocks per se that can be altered by the owner and the staff. So we will remind that we do have a noise ordinance and that needs to be adhered despite the special use permit. So that's one noise element, the hours of operation that wasn't really discussed. The board, this is just a suggestion, but the board may explore conditioning hours of certain noise or how long the lights are on. Events outdoors, or at least music events are limited to 10:00 p.m. at the site. Right now, I don't think people playing golf is similar to that intensity, but it's something considered stuff in your power. The lighting on the course are three foot lighting posts as shown on the little green lighting posts. So those will have downward illumination on the course after dark. These are not like a parking lot lights or anything like that. So it's going to be very kind of like what you see in a landscape yard, I guess. And this is all artificial turf except for the walkways. So this is, it has drainable base and that's all been submitted as well. Not probably under this board's purview. In analyzing special use permits, we have a nine question standard. Much of that was addressed in my presentation. I will address things such as is it allowed use the target district? It is. It applies to the zoning regulations, except for that, some of the conditions cited by staff. As far as moving that golf course on the property, staff contends this is a there's higher intensities on the property, so if this is in harm, this is in harmony with the use of the site. It's not adding a higher intensity that's going to impact the residential neighbors to the south even more or have a negative externality and not degrade the character harmony of the site. It won't discourage development in nearby or adjacent sites. Staff to address the parking it is still parked as much more parking spot. With that agreement in place with the YMCA addressing any devaluing of surrounding properties, it'll have sufficient buffering and screening. It already has a parking lot separating it from Tanglewood Road. And then there's also trees on that location that buff screen that area from Tanglewood Road and then the residential area is farther south. East is the city's property and it's actually industrial, kind of underutilized. And then also to the north is the same situation as Pleasant Valley, the bus barn. So staff contends that this will it's minimizing negative externalities if the special use permit were to be approved. This is consistent with the comprehensive plan shown as commercial district or commissioned commercial area. And it supports attract and retain business and industry is the goal. And given all that, staff contends all specialty use standards are met and recommends approval of the request.

And given all that, staff contends all specialty use standards are met and recommends approval of the request. I can take any questions? Any questions? There a sidewalk? I didn't look at the thing. The location of the golf courses meadow sidewalk is right here. Okay. I believe they proposed to have a walkway. I'm not sure if it's going to. That will be kind of in this building site plan phase as far as being ADA standards and all the. All those things. But I believe there'll be an interior walkway as well. It's adjacent to the current site up there and the comings and goings along there. It would seem that as far as the. So the sidewalk she just showed you, that's an interior sidewalk? Interior private sidewalk. Okay. Just parking lot. There's not a sidewalk being added at the right of way? No, there's no right of way additions here. There's actually a. That's actually a trail, I believe, or it's a large sidewalk. There's a sidewalk on both sides on the north side of tangled. Yeah, there is. Behind the building. Just for everyone. Got it. I got it. Everyone's knowledge. This is really what we're looking at right here. Yep, I got it. And then this, this area right here is. That's all city property. And you go farther north, that's the maintenance center and our parks maintenance area and then public works and planning department. Okay. I'm in favor of the project. Yeah. My only fear is the parking spots. And as long as they don't go away, you'll be in good shape. That'll be a problem. So. But they know that. So I think we did talk about that and we're requiring evidence of those agreements, those part. Well, ones with the city. So of course we have the evidence. But the parking agreement with the YMCA as well, with any user in town or any business in town, if they suddenly lost their access to parking or removed parking, then their use would be subject to that change and they would have to accommodate less parking with probably less intense use. I certainly hope that doesn't happen because I think we all believe this is a really nice business to have in town, but they are required to meet that parking count. And if they can't, then that use would be impacted or other uses would be impacted on that site. And that's just the rules. Hopefully that won't happen because it is a great facility for the community. Mark, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we currently have no parking on Tanglewood at this location. Correct. Not on the road. Good thing you didn't see my truck. Yes. And previously Tanglewood was not improved. It was not curb and gutter. You had ditches and you had a shoulder. So it's very easy to park on now at the curb and gutter, you're really hopping on the curb into a boulevard, really, or grass, given that you have Devil's Glen Road, which is obviously no parking without that YMCA spot or our spot, they're very isolated for expansion of parking. We have similar situations in other parts of town where when you go to a place and it's full, you're walking a block, or you can do that. Yeah, I mean, we have. There has been events here, but. So we don't think that parking on. We get in some situations where there's over parking from one business to another business property, in this case. Yeah. Now, that's not our problem. I know. Okay. Any other questions about anybody in the audience want to talk in favor of it? You want to say anything? Okay. All right, very good. Any other questions from the board? No. How about a motion to approve or deny? I'll make the motion to approve case 240, one seven to allow the special use permit. I'm. Second motion a second. How about roll call, please. Gallagher? Yes. Spranger? Yes. Handsy? Yes. Yes. Vermillion? Yes. Okay, we're all done. Thank you for coming.

When you do, we would appreciate it if you'd go to the back podium and to give us your address. Your name and address. For the record, we have. Looks like we've got two members that are on YouTube. I guess it is teams. So that'll make it a little cumbersome, but it'll work. And with that, we'll go to the first. Looks like the first case. 230 six nine. Mister chairman, this is related to the case. Very. Next up, 230 four nine. This is Glenbrook Ridge, fourth edition. This is a replat, and you'd originally seen it before, but now there's a different configuration based on a new floodway projection. It's being presented by Nelson Development one, LLC, otherwise known as Nelson Construction and development. And the request is to take a replay of out lot eight and out lot one from Glenbrook Ridge, second edition, and lot two and out lot f of Glenbrook Ridge, third edition, and combine them essentially into one plant. The area surrounding here is pretty much all urban medium intensity with urban low intensity, the southwest and urban low intensity land use to the west. There is some greenway land use, and then there is semi public here where the tower is, and then some urban high intensity land use as well. The urban medium intensity land use for this area facilitates the zoning to urban medium intensity. You still have a one to the southwest for zoning, but the majority of the area is surrounded by urban medium intensity. And then across the street, a one and c two, and then to the further to the west, r three. In this district. The proposal that will be coming up at the site development plan level calls for multifamily housing. Arrows, otherwise known as multiple family structures, is the term that is used under the UHI definition for zoning. Lot configuration for the proposed plat is such that lot one now will be made up of a part of that out lot eight and lot one from the prior second edition, and then also lot one or lot two and out lot f of the third edition. But what we have is 4.62 acres as the result of that. And that's essentially this area right here. They're also adjoining out lots. Detention out lot one here, which is 1.35 acres, and then detention out lot that is right here too, which is 1.47. This area right here below is still all floodway. That is 6.14 acres designated as out lot a as a part of Glenbrook Bridge. Fourth edition, third edition. This area here was what was platted. That is part of this plat tonight, out lot f and lot two. The second edition was this area. There's the tension basin one and then this entirety of out lot eight that now makes up the fourth edition. The reason that we've seen a difference here between the original approved plat that went through city council on November 7 and this is the new one, is that the new flood insurance rate map has diminished greatly the area that is flood weight, so that the area that might be filled now is far greater than what was originally shown you back last fall. And that's why the proceeding is different going through this new plat. That plat did not get recorded, the prior one that was approved by city council. So in essence, it's not really a replat of that platform. This will give you an idea here that most of the utilities are coming through this area connecting to the structure. You do have a major gas main here coming through, 75ft in width, with a pipeline that is also running through, and that's going to necessitate further permissions from the pipeline company at some point for connectivity, thoroughfare and access. You've got access Northridge circle, and then you have, I should say, Glenbrook Circle north and then branches off to Glenbrook Circle south. This is, remember, a easement area. This is a private drive here. This is a public street here. And then there is also a south access way drive. It currently connects from Devil's Glen over to the existing quartet. There will be obligations on all property owners within this area to maintain and keep these as open ways. The city will not take on any of those responsibilities. There's also anticipated a trail that will be placed in the area below here, below where the structure is actually anticipated. And then you do have sidewalks that do come up along the building from the south end on the east side, and you have the general sidewalk connecting out from Glenbrook Circle south to the major to the arterial street.

Devils Glen. Stormwater again will be maintained in these two outlets. These are regional basins and this is the firm that the comparison was referring to before the floodway is down here now. And this is what will be on September, either April 11 of this year. It will become active once it has totally proceeded through city council. I believe last night was one of the might have been the final reading for that particular item. Staff in recommending approval of the final plat would also attach these conditions to any approval I would ask. Are there any questions? Anyone have any questions on the recommendation? Greg, owner developer site to provide caretaking agreement for outlets during recording the plan. What are those? Do we know what the caretaking agreement is usually, and then how do you hold them to that standard if we don't know what that is? Or do we know what that is? We don't have anything yet, but we've had the provisions in the past that we do have caretaking agreements for the regional detention, that there needs to be something for all the parties to sort of share that burden. And I believe our city engineer can elaborate typically what we have for policy on that. Ultimately, Lynn, it would just be that they have to make sure that they are meeting city code and meeting our stormwater ordinance. We would not go into specifics. We would leave that between the property owners. If there was something for a public infrastructure that we were requiring caretaking, that'd be different. But ultimately, we leave it between the private parties. So it can grow up, it can do whatever it wants. We don't say that again. It can grow, it can fill in, it could not. We don't specify those. No. Well, that is built into city code, so if there is violations, then yes, we would apply that. But in terms of who is doing what, we leave that between them. Thank you. Sure. I'm curious, Greg. Why didn't the original plaque get recorded? When we went through the process, we discovered that the firm and we brought this to the attention of the developer that this is going to become active. The original plat would show the older outlawed area, which is far more extensive. So in order for the structure to have potential to be placed with the number of units that it has, this is the preferred design, that this be replicated here and that this be the new outline so that it doesn't come strictly down here. This is where the old boundary was. The new boundary is down here. So there's more land mass that can be used to support the density level that is anticipated for the structure. That's one thing I really appreciate about you guys on this team here with the city. You're always looking out for the developers and helping people be aware of what's coming, appreciate that about you guys. Thanks, Greg. Okay, Ann or Roy, either one of you have any questions or comments? Not for Roy. I have one comment either on this one or the site plan. Just confirmation that nothing will be done until the easement or the beneficial interest in the easement approves any utilization of it. Scott, I did have one question. Go ahead, Greg. You mentioned the trail. Is that trail for the benefit of that property only, or is it connecting to an existing trail? It does not connect any trail that is publicly held. It is, I believe, for the benefit of the people who live there. It's designed for their sake. It connects to that area to the north. We had anticipated at one time that there might be a trail connection, and that was the parks department that was thinking about doing something along those lines, but that's been since dismissed due to the rugged nature of trying to connect a trail through this area. Okay, thank you. Okay, Roy, just back to your question or comments on this particular case. When we do have a motion, as long as we're going with the staff recommendations, I think that takes care of it. The easement part, and then the next case when we get to that one. I believe it says right in there, that will not move forward until the floodplain stuff is taken care of. Anyone in the audience wish to address us on this? No. I have one more question. Yep, go ahead, Lynn. It makes reference to the trash pickup will be handled through a private service. What about snow removal? Sorry, I just didn't. Snow removal. Trash pickup handled through private service. Yep. Snow removal is all private. Private snow removal. The same, except for the right of way, which is established in the northern part of the subdivision. Gotcha. Unless it's right away, it doesn't get snow removal from us. So the private drive does not get snow. Once you come into the subdivision, everything to the east and the north is public. Glenbrook circle south to the west is private. So that'll be posting that. Yeah. And that'll be part of the hoa. And that already is, actually. So that's already built, obviously. So they have been doing that for three years at this point.

Anyone in the audience wish to address us on this? No. I have one more question. Yep, go ahead, Lynn. It makes reference to the trash pickup will be handled through a private service. What about snow removal? Sorry, I just didn't. Snow removal. Trash pickup handled through private service. Yep. Snow removal is all private. Private snow removal. The same, except for the right of way, which is established in the northern part of the subdivision. Gotcha. Unless it's right away, it doesn't get snow removal from us. So the private drive does not get snow. Once you come into the subdivision, everything to the east and the north is public. Glenbrook circle south to the west is private. So that'll be posting that. Yeah. And that'll be part of the hoa. And that already is, actually. So that's already built, obviously. So they have been doing that for three years at this point. So any new units would be subject to the same thing, ma'am. Thank you. You want to discuss this case as well, mister chairman? And then vote on them together, or. I think we should do them separately. Okay. All right. Chris has spoken. So with that, if there no other questions. Looking for a motion? So, chairman, I move to approve case number 230 six nine, subject to any staff recommendations. I'll second that. Okay, Lynn beat you to it. All right, three. Okay. Any discussion on the motions? All right, hearing none. All in favor say aye. Aye. Aye. Opposed? Same sign? Okay, there's none. So the motion carries. This case, mister chairman, is related in that it is about the site plan. I've already gone through these slides regarding a number of the issues. Essentially what you're looking at for the site plan is 111 unit multifamily structure that is here outlined in the tan. It meets our standards based on the area that could be filled, excluding out loud a, there's 2912 each unit. The requirement is for there to be 2500 each unit of land area. In this design, the density is 14.96 units that is proposed. The upward limit is 17. So the petitioner has met both of those standards. In regard to the movement in the floodway, this will give you an idea of what the structure will look like. It's going to be somewhat similar to the existing structure and the size requirements have been met. We would put that there is also a condition in here regarding the basement area for garage that there is anticipated a set of pumps for pumping any water out of the basement area if it were to flood. And that would have to have an overview from any of our people, either in engineering or in the building department. Utilities, again, are all stubbed in, primarily from the north into the structure. And we do have this 75 foot easement, again, which the building is not in any part of this, but shall require because of some encroachment of parking in that drive area, written permission from the utility and that is an agreement that will have to be presented prior to the issuing of building permits. And again, we talked about the thoroughfare access, again off of devil's Glen Road, primarily through the south access drives that exist, and then through Glenbrook Circle north down to Glenbrook Circle south pedestrian trail. The same thing. Again, there is nothing that is actually different. What we had discussed. The parking 215 spaces are provided, 209 are required. Eight ADA spaces shall be provided. 106 of these parking spaces shall be in the basement area that I previously discussed. 109 parking spaces shall be located outside the structure. Stormwater detention. Again, as you can see, these designs in here for these areas that are enclosed for out lots one and two, and then there will be water quality elements that will also have to be verified prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy. For these, the trees are being planted and there are more than enough trees that have been provided by the developer. They'll be planted in non easement areas. Our concern is that they just get planted. We don't want to see them intruding in any easement areas. Lighting shall be downcast on the site. And again, this is the firm showing the 100 year, or I should say the floodway and the 100 year floodplain. And the changes in the receiving of both staff would make a recommendation for approval of the site development plan. With the conditions listed. I would ask, are there any questions? Any questions? All right, hearing none. Anyone in the audience wish to address us on this? Everyone's quiet tonight. All written out pretty well in the staff recommendations. Yeah, agreed. All right, then. Anyone want to make a motion? Mister chairman, I move to approve case 23069, subject to all the staff recommendations. Second, is that 49? Are we four nine? Yep. 23049, subject to all the staff recommendations. Second. We got a second. All right, one more chance. Any further discussion on this? No. All right, all those in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? Same sign. Motion carries. All right, onward. Our next case regards the final plat for unity point crossing at first edition. Applicant is Kevin Kellner. Focus development. This is already coming before city council. The first reading and public hearing were held last night. First step has been approved and there will be two more readings. Current land use is community commercial. And we have parks and rec over here in the DaB, port side. Urban light intensity to the east of 74. And then we have public, semi public, further to the north. Zoning, again, somewhat reflects with the open space to the west. And Davenport community commercial zoning throughout the area surrounding this proposed development. And then we have r1, single family on the east side of I 74. This site is, of course, transitioning to a c three zoning class. That this body had already reviewed earlier. And as I mentioned, it's already gone through the first reading in public hearing.

This is the sewer map showing sort of the retracement of this plot. It has never been platted. And this is the platting here. There's a dedication area here to make sure the right of way is actually being assigned to Kimberly Road. And we have a breakout of five lots that are somewhat following the configuration of the parking area. We've also got necessary easements that have been added. And also we have accesses to each one of these lot areas to make sure that each lot has proper access. As you can see in this overlay, there is a following of what is a pattern throughout this parking lot. And then also acknowledgement of the hobby lobby building. And we wanted to make sure each one of these areas conforms to the setbacks that are shown. The thoroughfare access, essentially is Kimberly Road. And there are two main access points. These are going to remain as they are as shown on the plaid on the flag portion. As you can see here and here, the utilities are being provided for. Finally, acknowledgement of easements being placed on site is what is key here. And we have pedestrian trail access primarily is this sidewalk here. Most of the traffic coming into this area is going to be all vehicular, so we don't anticipate anything major in that regard. Staff, in reviewing the proposal, recommends approval as it does meet Goal C, to attract and retain businesses and industry in the goals and plan organization segment of the comprehensive plan. I would ask you any questions. Any questions? Just one, Greg. Miss Roy, does any of this site, or is any of this site impacted in any kind of flood zone? And is that changing with the new map that's being adopted with the other map? Yeah, with the other map, there was no encroachment. And with the new map, there is no encroachment. Okay, thank you. Anyone in the audience which wish to address this on this? No. All right, if there's no questions, anyone have a motion? Mister chairman, I move to approve case 240 zero. Eight. Subjective staff recommendations. Second. All right, any further discussion? Hearing, none. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? Same sign. Motion carries. Our next case. Mister chairman, it's 240 one one. It's 6021 Valley Drive. It's one of the lots that faces out toward Valley Drive. Right here. It's lot eight of fields development, first edition. Greg Franich of symmetry mortgage is the applicant. It's for contractor. Condos is essentially what the application concerns. Future land use. Designation is industrial, and that supports the overall land use. Or I should say the zoning that has occurred here. There's been a delimiter, if you will, or a boundary where valley drive, north and east or north and west, I should say, has been typically residential. And then everything back here in the early 1970s got rezoned primarily to an I two zoning classification. And that's what it is right now. So you have residential to the north and industrial primarily to the south. This is the lot of record right here that is involved. It's approximately one acre. The amount of lot coverage, given that the building is 10,300 sqft, is only 24%. So it meets that requirement. The structure itself also meets the requirement in terms of height. Question comes up whether or not the 30 foot or 25 foot setback should be observed from this area. It would be brought up to the board of adjustment to see if the buffer yard would need to be at that distance of 30ft. It is rather a constrained parcel and there is an area where water is attempting to be allowed to be conveyed. On the backside of this lot, it will be a six unit structure of 10,300 sqft that the proposal is being brought to us as tonight. Let's give you an idea of how this will look. Utilities are going to primarily again come from Valley Drive, almost everything. And the south connection there is a sanitary sewer connection available. The thoroughfare access shows this area being cut off here, part of the subdivision of fields. These two lots here were meant to have direct access only to valley dry. When this is platted, there will be no trail or sidewalk connection as this is pretty much a vehicular use site and there are definitely a good amount of parking spaces for what is required. 17 spaces provided and then additional. Within each of these structures, typically you would see one half space for each employee and then one for each vehicle used in the conduct of the business. And the stormwater detention stormwater will be allowed to be conveyed off the back of the lot. And this is looking at the lot back up toward Valley Drive. There is a drop off. This area is primarily flat and filled, and then there's immediate, somewhat of a drop as you get back toward this area, which is where the water tends to drain and would drain more normally toward the east. Landscaping and lighting. Eight tree factors will be planted along Valley Drive right of way. There will be two required in the vehicular use area and all lighting s", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Unity Point Crossing\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Attracts and retains businesses and industry\",\n            \"Approved by staff\",\n            \"No flood zone encroachment\",\n            \"Comprehensive plan goals alignment\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"buy\",\n        \"comment\": \"Unity Point Crossing is aligned with the city's goal to attract and retain businesses.

This lot has already been removed and is acknowledged on the new firm that it is no longer within the 100 year floodplain. Staff, in reviewing the proposal, would recommend approval. There are two conditions, one being that the site plan go before the the board of adjustment for evaluation as to the hardship, whether or not there should be that hardship reduction. And then the other one is that the we go again with the water quality mechanisms in dealing with those being certified by the city engineer. Other than that, staff recommends approval. Mister chairman, can I just clarify the staff report? Because I think as you read through that, you kind of saw there was the 30 foot front yard buffer, which would be the normal thing that you would review and make a recommendation on today. Like any other site plan, if there are constraints on the lot, and the petitioner wants to go to the board of adjustment to have some of those constraints removed, such as a five foot less setback, as is the case here, the petitioner's indicated that may be something they choose to do. That would be a board of adjustment decision just so you're aware. Thank you. Okay. Any questions? Would they've normally done that? First? We don't usually have two choices in front of us. No, I think. I think it was really just a kind of transparency. Okay. 30 foot is what is under code. It's for an industrial lot. It's small. Industrial lots have the most bulk standards, the most restrictive bulk standards put on them. So when you do that to a small lot, it causes some constraints, obviously. And so I think the petitioner has contemplated that's certainly their decision, but contemplated that and shown that in their drawings, provided that they, you know, they're gonna have a 30 foot option. But if they do receive board of adjustment approval, they may choose to seek that, I should say. So. This process is not out of the ordinary, necessarily out of order. No, it's just, you know, about it. Understood. Brent, can you go ahead. That's the question I'm asking. Brent, could you clarify what water quality mechanisms are required for the back of that property and why? So that's just our typical stormwater detention. So this lot was part of a previous subdivision. So stormwater detention itself is actually provided off site within the rest of the subdivision regionally. But the subdivision was built before we added water quality to our stormwater ordinance. So they are required to provide just the water quality component. So they have a bioswale that's located at the west property line that will then discharge that water down around the building and ultimately to the detention. Gotcha. Thank you, Roy. Yeah. One question about the parking. I'm sensing just a little chicken egg. Clarify for me. So we got a six unit contractor condominium, but if our code formula is based on half an employee per unit and such, how do we know what the math is going to be till we know who's actually occupying it? We run into this problem. We've had this problem with other projects of a similar nature in this area, and that is pretty much the burden that will have to be carried by the people who are renting on site. We cannot anticipate the number of vehicles or employees in every one of these instances. So it almost comes down to a standard of what the renter and the person renting the property to them will be able to withstand. We have not run into any problems with these type condos over parking. There are other issues, though, further on down with other types of businesses where there has been a parking issue, but to try to gauge that number of parking spaces based on trying to figure out how many vehicles there may be or employees that is something that we are not going to hit an exact figure. We are not going to always be able to do that. The code just makes some assumptions here. Our parking code is what it is. But it does make some assumptions that these contractor condos are really, that they're usually one man or one woman, shops with one or two vehicles. They come in in the morning, run out, do their calls, do their service calls, whatever they're going to do. Using a fleet vehicle to do that and have a personal vehicle parked and then reverse that in the evening, it's just that's assumed in code. So that's how it's calculated. Thank you. Where does it say these are rentals? They're not individual, they're not going to be sold? Well, it actually says condominium. Condominium. It does? Yeah. Yeah. They could be all of the above. The ownership regime is not under our review. No. But would that change our parking requirement if it ends up being a condo versus a rental? No. Okay. Anyone in the audience wish to address us in this? If you could go to the podium. Thank you. Joseph Bowl. B O l L. I'm the small lot adjacent to it.

Anyone in the audience wish to address us in this? If you could go to the podium. Thank you. Joseph Bowl. B O l L. I'm the small lot adjacent to it. The house there were about where it says 30 foot setback design. Just a couple small concerns, I guess. Is it established how far the set off is from our property line to the back of the building? I believe I was told 25ft. I just wanted to make sure that was correct. Mister chairman, we'd have Greg answer that. Greg, can you. Yeah. Magnify this here and see if we can. 13. It's a total, I believe at 25. Well, no, we have 13 and we have 12.8 right here. It's a little over 25. A little over 25. There's twelve between the building and your property line. Yep. And then that would be kind of finished off. Like lawn back there. Grass. Correct. Maybe like shrubbery of some sort or how's that transition into our yard? They're not required to place any landscaping in terms of shrubbery because you're both I two. That's up to the discretion of the developer if he would like to do that. They graded that in such a manner that the slope. I'm not certain as to know what way that might be to facilitate that, but that is up to his discretion because you're both itwo general industrial district and another concern was the shrubbery and some of the stuff at the road. It's like a racetrack down there and pulling out in the driveway. We have kids that are gonna be driving soon and all the neighbors across the road have kids who are driving soon. Just a little bit of concern of that with traffic and then the shrubbery, you know that it ain't too obnoxious and blinding per se was just a small concern. I can answer the question about the site distance there. So we do have requirements to maintain site distance. Triangles at all the corners of the entrances. So that no permanent of structure. So whether it be a sign or landscaping would cause a sight line. Right? Yeah. So those may be graphically shown there. But once they actually get the planting, our group will. Our building department will make sure that the sight lines at the driveways are clear. So they may have to be adjusted slightly. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Thank you. I'm gonna look up that site required site yard setback. But it's industrial to industrial is the issue here. Even though it's occupied by a home right now, the use there is a legal, non conforming use where the home resides. I'll give you in just a minute here. The Taylor's got it. Okay. Yeah. It's a sum of 25ft. So if you have ten and 15 or twelve and a half. And twelve and a half. So he has total 25 on all the side yards. He's divided by two. They're well exceeded. And then, Greg, you were saying that the slope or the grade slopes down quite a bit from this new building towards the property flat. And then there is an abrupt here and then down here as well. You have a drop off that occurs within a very short distance of maybe about like 5ft. But it's not sloping down towards the house. Right. There's a slope over here already. This has already been filled. So there is. But the house is removed from that slope. It's not like the toe of this down here is right up against the house. There's area to dissipate where the water can come down, Jenna. So they're required to. So it's hard to see on there. There is a drain tile that collects all the runoff from the roofs and pipes it all the way around. I was hoping, assuming that's what you were saying earlier. But I just wanted to clarify since there is a. So the only. The only off site drainage would be grass. Okay. Thank you. Which is exactly what exists now. Okay. Okay. Just so I understand, because the Bowles house is zoned industrial as well. There's nothing that requires then this building to have any protection or any fencing, anything to protect the neighboring property, regardless if it's a house or just because of the zoning. Zoning. Understood. Thank you. Okay. Anyone else in the audience wish to address us on this? Good evening everyone. My name is Greg Franich. I'm the developer and potential developer. Thank you for your time in the review and for the staff and their review. I just wanted to clarify one thing. Greg. You mentioned on the site plan the distance from Mister Bowles property line to the back of the building. My understanding is that's in excess of 25ft. That's correct. So you've got 28ft. It shows 25ft, Greg. The total setback required for the entire property is twelve and a half feet on each side. Or a sum of 25. You're actually doubling that. Okay. I just wanted to make sure there was a misunderstanding. I promised everybody in the neighborhood that would, especially Mister Bolt if that would be 25ft from heaven. That's what it's shown. Sounds good. Thank you. Thank you. I have a question. I see the portable toilet placed right in somewhere in the driveway. And also the concrete wash washout part of the handicap stall. Is that something that how it's going to be designed? Those are just the erosion control plan. So that's just while it's under construction? Yeah, while it's under construction.

One. Last chance. Any further discussion? No hearing? None. All those in favor say aye. Opposed? Same sign. Motion carries. All right, on to the public hearing on the rezoning of 1017 Grant Street. Mister Chairman, this is a rezoning anticipated for what was a single family dwelling. And this area along Grant street there's commingling and many different zoning classes. If you go from 6th all the way over to 26th street along Grant, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. This is lot five, block 17. A Riverview edition. SJF Homes LLC. Arc and Amber homes are the applicants in this instance and they're requesting that rezoning from r two single family residence district to see neighborhood commercial district land use permits such a rezoning request as future land use is designated urban low intensity. That permits a rezoning to c one neighborhood commercial district. And that would permit the. What they would want is a real estate office here, which is something that would fall under the general office category. Throughout most of the area you do see two reals adjoining this structure and then two reals to the north. But you also have c three, which is the most intense zoning use for commercial property. Just directly across the alley from this location. Lot size is 0.107 acres. There is no minimum in a c one district for lot width or size. What you see here is the structure, and then behind it you see axis, which will be anticipated to be used for parking. And then you see three zoning over in this locale. It's part of the overlay district for the master plan. Downtown master plan the downtown master plan lists as an objective small scale redevelopment projects north of State street, which this is also development character, that is to provide a mix of office, retail and residential throughout. And the petitioner's area is right here in the West Bridge district, so it's not something that was seen out of place. This is the original plat showing the lot, which is 92 one 2ft by 50ft. This is the plot plan drawn by the petitioner, showing what they will do in terms of putting parking in. They only need three spaces, they're providing six. And then they will also take and adjoin the cement or paving to the city. Existing sidewalk thoroughfare area is pretty well clear. You have Grant street to the north, you have 10th that comes down and then accesses the alley. So there's entry into the rear portion of this parcel. And then you have Interstate 74, which is approximately two blocks away from this parcel. Utilities are already in place. If there needs to be anything done, then fire and our building department will handle any of those issues as they would be interior issues. Pedestrian access is pretty much along the sidewalk. Again, this is going to be one of those businesses that is generating vehicular traffic, mainly to come to this locale and use the services we talked about, off street parking. Again, this area here will be designed in such a manner that it will provide at least the required number of parking spaces, plus 180 a space. Staff recommends approval of the rezoning because it meets goal c in attracting and retaining business in an industry. And also given the test that we put these types of rezoning requests through, it meets all the requirements. The conditions that we would add to this particular rezoning regard the paving of the front entry of the structure to the city sidewalk, and then also providing a dry and dustless surface for any parking lot in the rear of the parcel. I would ask, are there any questions? Okay, this is the. This is a public hearing, so this can be handled a little differently. First, is there proof of publication for case 240? One four. Yes, there is. Yes, there is. Okay, we'll open the public hearing on this. Is there any public comment on this particular case? Yes, sir. Good evening, I'm David Baker at 327 10th street in Bettendorf. That's caddy cornered from this property. Generally I would be in favor of this change and I want to thank you for the opportunity to provide input here this evening. Thank you to Mister Beck for the background. I was able to read some of that today, but some of the specifics. The people in the area probably didn't know what the intention of the owners of what they wanted to do. I've got a couple of questions about the particular building, if there's any plans to augment the size of the building in the future. Is there anything in the proposal that indicates that. No, it's just a rezoning request and we don't anticipate a site plan to follow. This will be used as has built. There are a couple minor improvements, some sidewalk, pedestrian walkway and kind of cleaning up the parking in the back off the alleyway that already exists. Okay, there you go.

That's caddy cornered from this property. Generally I would be in favor of this change and I want to thank you for the opportunity to provide input here this evening. Thank you to Mister Beck for the background. I was able to read some of that today, but some of the specifics. The people in the area probably didn't know what the intention of the owners of what they wanted to do. I've got a couple of questions about the particular building, if there's any plans to augment the size of the building in the future. Is there anything in the proposal that indicates that. No, it's just a rezoning request and we don't anticipate a site plan to follow. This will be used as has built. There are a couple minor improvements, some sidewalk, pedestrian walkway and kind of cleaning up the parking in the back off the alleyway that already exists. Okay, there you go. All right, that answers that question. What about signage and lighting facing Grant street or in the alley where we have still some residential property there? They'll have to comply with all the standards of the overlay district and then our sign code and then all lighting will have to be downcast on the lot itself. It cannot be permitted to emanate on the adjoining properties. Okay, very good. And you've already answered my question regarding the parking in the rear and I'm going to make a comment here. As a longtime property owner for Bettendorf, 21 years at my location, that was a single well parking space when I moved in and it was owned by an individual and then it was sold to another owner that turned it into rental property. I believe without city staff's knowledge it became a multi bay parking area and it was never paved. So we have had a number of issues of multiple vehicles parking there in the alley. And being a good neighbor, I have not called the police in 911 to alert them about this, but as we speak there's a camper actually parked out there. So I would welcome a change like this and the area to be paved properly and as I heard Ada, there'd be an ADA space available as well. So I just want to confirm that that is going to occur. That is recommended. The paving back there? Yes. Our code would require a dry dustless surface, so it has to be impermeable. It could be paved, it could be asphalt pavers. However they accomplish that, as long as it meets our code and then they are required to have 180 a space for that facility. Excellent. One last question. Will this be tenant occupied yet, or is the property going to be solely for business use? Again, the ownership regime is not something we evaluate. We are told by the petitioner they intend to use it for their own business purposes, which is, I think, insurance or real estate. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. That answers my questions. Thank you very much. C one. And be like commercial. Right. So office type space. Yeah, typically. Okay. Anyone else in the audience that wishes to address us on this issue? All right, so we're going to close the public hearing part. And now any questions or comments from the commissioner? I have one. You referenced, one of you referenced this. I understand this is rezoning requests and there's more steps. Right. But we're not going to see a site plan. The approval for council is going to come from this. So the rezoning is what's before you. Now, I don't anticipate a site plan because there's really not much going on here. The house is going to be the house, and they're going to have a sidewalk in a parking lot that already exists. Fair enough. And I don't know if this is within city control, but most petitioners get to hire an engineer and present something other than a hand drawn plan, and I don't love the hand drawn plan. That's just me. So as far as standards records, way things appear, the way things get read by commissioners in public, I would appreciate in the future if we could do that. But if it's not within our control. Yeah, we don't have that standard. It's not something I can impose right now. So, on the rezoning, but we could look at that. What I hear you saying, Mark, is that this is a house that's already there, just going to be used for a different purpose, and that's going to be improved in the back from a gravel parking space to a paved parking space, it should be already and a little bit more background. So a residential house with a home occupation in it, say you want to sell your, whatever, cookies out of it or something, is totally legal in an r one district. But if you're not living at the premise, it's a business that is required to be in a commercial district. And that is because there's not enough room, from the petitioner's point of view, to both occupied as a residence and have business there. So hence the rezoning request. Certainly what Taylor's saying, maybe more diplomatic than me, is if the petitioner just told us they were going to live there, they could start this business tomorrow. There would be no review for the city at all under current state law. So actually, they've gone above and beyond, in my opinion. Okay. Yeah, I just had the same observation. Probably your perspective as Lynn. I know we're in a different standard here, but I would love to have seen, hey, how many feet is it from the actual alley line to the back of the building? What's the dimension? Space on these parking spaces? That would give me a higher comfort level that you can essentially park six vehicles, including an ADA, in there. And I know that's going to be accomplished. It's pretty hard to tell from that. But if it's not required, it's not required. Any other questions or comments? No. All right, then we need a motion. Mister chairman, I move to approve case number 240 one four, subject to staff recommendations. I'll second. All right, one last chance for comments.

Taylor's going to take this one, which is also a public hearing. Thank you. Okay, the next case for you is case 240 zero nine. This is a request for rezoning north of Crow Creek Road. Has the. It's currently agricultural, but has the address of 6500 just north of Pleasant View Elementary School. The applicant is Adam. Site's doing business as Pheasant Creek State's LLC. Rezoning is for 20 little over 20 acres of land currently zoned a one. The request is for two reals, single family residence district. Their proposal. The development proposal includes single single family subdivision containing 23 lots for 23 detached homes. So you have a picture of the property right there. Current zoning and future land use. The future land use map designates this area as urban. Low intensity areas located north and around zoning track are also low intensity. There is floodplain to the northeast from a creek. That area is parksick open space on the right hand side. We have the current zoning which is a one, our agricultural urban reserve and then our surrounding properties, our zone single family r one. Apart from the elementary school, which is a remnant tract in a one, the proposed zoning is two reals single family residents. R two is consistent with the ULi future land use designation and development consistent with goals outlined in the currently adopted comprehensive plan. Single family detached houses are allowed in this district. I will note the proposed 23 lots are considered large for this zoning district. Lot sizes are over four and a half times the minimum lot size that 20. The different main difference between r one and r two is 25 versus 30 foot setbacks and the developers proposing that to actually allow additional trees be preserved on the both the west and the east side of the subdivision. A concept for the proposed rezoning frontage has the tract has frontage on Crow Creek Road. The road would connect just west of a current retaining wall and then switch back up the slope. There's some steep topography there, but they will be working with the as much as they can with the topography. This would be a public right of way and it would end at the north property line of this rezoning tract. Future development north of this tract is owned by a separate property owner, but that would allow that development of that tract and then connect to Winfield Court which is currently developed. I will note that Pigeon Creek Trail is not proposed to connect to the subdivision or future development. This area has already been developed. There are two vacant lots that are currently zoned r1 and they are proposed to be developed and that will be the end of that street. The proposed development does not necessitate any additional connectivity at this time. It's under our maximum allowed lots for a single connection to Crow Creek and then if we're future development to the north, it would connect to have two connections, Mudfield Court and Crow Creek, and it meets any fire code and accessibility requirements. As noted, there is floodplain just in the far east portion of the rezoning tract. This area is not proposed for development per se. They'll be contained in lots, but it's reserved for open space and no houses will be part of that. You also note Winfield Court up here on the aerial right there in the blue. That will be the kind of future this is not really working for me. Future planned route for kind of the master plan for a future road rezoning requests must adequately address seven criteria as outlined in section 1115 13 B. Those have to meet the standard for a positive staff recommendation. Staff contends the request meets this requirement. Analysis for each criteria is included in the staff report for this case. Given the evidence and reasons stated in the staff analysis. Staff recommends the planning zoning commission recommend approval of the proposed rezoning request from a one to two reals. I can take any questions. Thank you. Is there proof of publication for this case? There is. All right. With that, we will open the public hearing for case 240 zero nine.

Is there a plan to make that connection in the future? There is not. There is not. Correct. So what type of barrier will be put up there? So it will be similar to other. Usually you see them in temporary turnarounds in subdivisions. But it's a three diamond barrier. Usually just on a fence or on fence posts that would go up there. We have. The applicant is also purchasing the lot directly across the street from you. On the north side of Pigeon Creek trail. And going to be building one single family home on that. And we have worked out an agreement with them. That will provide a way for our city vehicles. To utilize the driveway as a turnaround. So for garbage and snow that currently is having to do a multi point turnaround. Having to do a multi point. Exactly. The area right now, how is runoff going to be addressed? Because right now when there's a heavy downpour. Not only do I get it in the backyard from the feeding of the rest of the houses. That lot that you have designated as not belonging to anyone will actually rise with water. So the concept, this is just a revilling. And we have further steps on when a parcel of land is proposed for development. There's the platting. That's the subdivision of that. And that's when they designate more. The engineering happens. Taylor, I think you may have to face forward you. So this is just the rezoning concept. Upon a further public meetings, there'll be a subdivision process, preliminary plat, final plat. And the engineering will really kind of look at those type of things. Right now they've designated an area just below, south of the road, north of Crow Creek. It's the low spot. I believe that's one possible area for detention. I don't believe they've asked the applicant if there's. They've not done engineering to make sure that there's more detention needed. So, yeah, Taylor, I believe he's talking at the end of Pigeon Creek trail. You're saying runoff. Right. You come down Pigeon Creek and I'm right here at the very end. I'm on the right side across the street from where you're going to be building. Right to what would be to the right of me looking at or looking at my house would be the left. That area I always thought was part of the. Belonged to Bob Walters, who developed that section. Now, it sounds like that's not the case, but that area itself took all the runoff from the, I guess, the creek or whatever. And now that's starting to build up that with a heavy rain, torrential water will be sitting there for at least a week. Yeah. And unfortunately, since that's off the city right away, that property was sold to the person that currently owns Bob Walters former house. Okay, just so we can try to orient ourselves, but the. The property that's southeast of you owns that piece of property. So ultimately, since it's on private property, they'll have to figure out how to handle that drainage. Yes. Yeah, that. And that is actually separate and distinct from this subdivision. Interesting. Okay, so they're going to be building, then starting the construction? Well, they'll do the one across the street from where I am, but the rest of this will then be starting from Crook Creek coming in. Yep. And as Taylor said, we have several more steps for the subdivision before they get anywhere near that. That lot across the street is a buildable lot, so they can just go apply for a standard building permit for a single home on that property. Okay, then just the last question I would have is are there any ordinance or guidance that's in place that would address construction vehicles in that area? That's a dead end. In just the last couple days it was. The workers were very considerate, but it makes it very difficult to get in and out when you got vehicles on both sides. Probably nothing that's specific in code, but I think if you make a phone call to actually, probably to Mark's group, to our building department, we can have an inspector go out there and work with that. We see it a lot, especially in new subdivisions. Yeah, well, like I said, they. They've been out there a couple days. We've had no problems. But my wife is a physician. She needs to get out, you know, during the middle of tight, I'm sure. So, yeah, we can absolutely help. Yeah. They certainly can't be blocking your driveway. They can't be leaving debris on the road. So if there's mud, mud and debris on the road, we get after them for that. The engineering team and the commdev team work together on those kinds of things. So if that's happening, we want to know. And then my construction inspectors, Brent's utility inspectors, are also out there. We try to stay on top of that stuff, too, but you can always call us and we'll send somebody out.

Well, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you. Yes, sir. Greg Gackle, 1116 Kofelt Avenue, Bettendorf. It's been a while since I looked at this plat out here. Back when I was on the planet zone. Commissioner, the settlement at Pigeon Creek was being developed just to the left of this and upstream. And one of the major questions that came up was why or how there would be access to the settlement at Pigeon Creek. There's something like 100 and some lots in that subdivision. And I can still recall at that meeting, Bob Walters was there and explained to the commission that when this other area was developed, that that Pigeon Creek Road would come down and connect to Crow Creek. Made sense, you know, and that was one reason that we approved back then. The settlement at Pigeon Creek with only one entrance, it's really not a good, it's really not a good way to do it with that many lots times that many cars with only one entrance and exit. So when this came up, I saw this in the newspaper. I was kind of shocked to see that there isn't any connection there. And Jeff Seitz, who's the developer, I think, owns that end lot, plus this lot, all these other lots. So it would seem to be under the control of the same person. And I don't know why the city, furthermore, would allow this subdivision without a connection on Pigeon Creek. I mean, the city is emphasized over and over again. They don't want cul de sacs. It screws up garbage collection, it screws up snow removal. And to have a block end to that, to basically two subdivisions, seems contrary to city policy, I guess. Yeah, Greg, I guess I'd like an explanation of why those don't connect. So part of what you said, Greg, is not correct in that the advanced homes and sites do not own all the properties. So unfortunately, with the way that Pigeon Creek trail was extended, the lot line that we were just referencing that exists between the. Taylor, can you think if there's a better way to show this without looking at. Zoom in. There you go. Thank you. He's got that. So that'd be perfect. So if you actually follow the the arc there of how that street was stubbed, it does not stay all on the advanced homes property, which means the city would have to condemn property from the south property owner. And that was not something that our administration was interested at this point in time. We do have a second entrance now, it's not the most direct one, we first want to admit that, but you have the entrance at Schoolhouse Road that does connect through a series of streets over to Settlers Point. And then the condition that this will connect to Winfield court when the property to the north develops, that will provide a secondary access as well. So if they did own all the property. Absolutely. We would make them dedicate the right of way, but they don't own it all. Yeah, I've looked at the ownership of that land and there's an llc that's run by Jeff Seitz that owns that land. No. So Greg, the property to the south that Jeff Campania owns, if you extend the street along the arc that it's built on, it would encroach onto his property. So we cannot, we're not going to go in and condemn that the direction of our city administrator and we cannot arc that street up and around to stay on that one single lot. I'm not going to argue with it. It's bad planning. And from the research from back when this was proposed to rezone settlement, Pigeon Creek 7th this whole area was proposed to be rezoned with settlement at Pigeon Creek 7th and that's when, that's why this has remained a one, because there was enough uproar about the amount of homes being accessed by one way. So this was left to a one and there was conditions placed that this area could only be developed when there's future access to Crow Creek and then ultimately future access to 53rd, which is no longer possible because 53rd has now since rerouted north. But it does have access to Winfield of any future development. Have access to Winfield Court, would connect to this street, which has access to Crow Creek, which would make it a better situation, meet our fire code, meet double access. It's really hard to fix the settlement. Pigeon Creek, which already has rezoned two, lock two parcels on that, that neighborhood. I can't take that back. Ultimately, Greg, in terms of poor planning, I really wish that when that was subdivided in 20, was it original? It was 2000. It was 24 years ago that right away should have been extended across all of Bob Walters property. And it was not. For some reason he was allowed to maintain that last lot and not include it in the subdivision. That's the reason we don't have the right of way across there. If you look back at the settlement at Pigeon Creek, 7th edition, that little sliver that was his single family home. Plus the property of the north was allowed to be exempted out of the subdivision. Never should have been. Who allowed that? We should move on. Mister chairman at that point. Any other public comment on this? Okay. Hearing? None. We will close the public hearing portion. Anyone on the commission with any questions? Just one. And we've referenced connecting Winfield court at some point. Is that up for discussion? Is there a development plan coming?

It's parcel. I can't see it at the moment, but it's the last lot on the north of Pigeon Creek trail. And that abuts in a little corner the property that we're talking about here, right? Correct. Yep. So is there. Is there not enough space on the south side of that lot to continue Crow Creek? Right. That's the. That's the crux of the matter is that when that subdivision was approved, the city, for whatever reasons, did not get right of way established. And two private lots were developed. And both those private lots were. Would encroach on the pathway that we would need to create the road to go through both the lot to the south. Although it's hard to see due to. Due to the. Due to the map's size, it's hard to see that, but with the full width of the profile, would not fit without encroaching on both of those lots. Okay. Yeah.

One two. Thank you, chairman. I'll present the next two cases, actually, 240 one two and zero one three. These are final plats and replats of forest Green, third edition and fourth editions. Background Chris McNamara, McNamara Construction these are two final plats. There was an original plat for this whole tract of land that was approved by this body and city council back in 2022. The applicant is requesting two phase of construction. In order to do that, they have to split each plat into thirds. The first phase, Forest Grove, second edition, was approved by this body and city council in July of 2023. These next two will finish out all proposed residential development for this area. I will note the proposed plats match the original plat concept from the rezoning and the original plat that was approved in 2022. This is purely from a phasing construction financial standpoint for replatting the original plats. Before you is 46 single family homes, 72 townhomes located, 19 buildings, a detention out lot an, out lot b, and then a reserved out lot a, which is still zoned agricultural but is reserved for future commercial and that's consistent with our future land use map. Property was resounded in 2022 to r three with the following condition, that the final plate development plan must material match the approved concept. Plan. Staff contends that is true and has been for the first phase and it's for the third edition, which is before you. This third edition plats out all the remaining single family lots and includes one town home lot on the upper northeast. There. This matches that originally proposed layout exactly. The fourth edition plats the remaining, all the remaining residential development, which are all townhome lots. They vary from three to four townhome units per building, and then that also shows out Lot A, which is reserved for future commercial development. This matches the original proposed layout and concept. Staff has reviewed submitted replats and contends no material changes to be made from the original concept and they've submitted applicable code requirements. Staff recommends approval of both forescreen, third edition 20 412 and four screen fourth edition 20 413. And I can take any questions. Great. Thank you. Any questions from anyone on the commission for either one of these? Anyone in the audience have any questions? Comments? Again, crickets. Easy peasy. All right, well, then I need a motion.

Here. All right, we have a quorum. This is the plan and zone commission. December 7. Member commission appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council. The commission is a recommended body only, with the city council making final decisions. Regular meetings of the plan and zone commissioner held on the third Wednesday of each month at 530 in the city hall chambers. City council chambers special meetings may be held at such times as necessary. The following items are presented and acted on by this commission. Rezoning plats preliminary and final plats site development landscape plans planned unit development plans. For those of you that are here in the audience, if you have anything to say today, we'd appreciate it if you'd go to the back podium, state your name and address when the time comes. Thank you. With that, great. As you mentioned, mister chairman, case 240 three one has been deferred till May 15. 1st up on our agenda. Hang on just a second. Forgot one thing. We need approval of the minutes from the March 20 meeting. Yes, mister Chairman. I'll move for approval of the March 20 meeting minutes I submitted. Second that. Thank you. In favor, say aye. Aye. Those same sign that carries. Go ahead. Sorry about that. Our item up, first of all on the agenda is case 240 one nine, masonic village two, which is a subdivision, 2500 Grant street. What we're looking at is this area where we do have the masonic lodge. We have independent living here and multifamily units. And then we have a nursing care facility at the northeast portion of this overall area. It's been proposed by Bettendorf, IASNf Propco, LlC. And it is to replat this ground, which is currently masonic village, and then to replat it into two lots of record and one outline. Future land use for the area is public semicublic. The surrounding area, urban low intensity. That's mainly an two reals. Zoning area, commercial community, commercial here, which is all this is our four reals underlying, I mean, I should say for the zoning. Urban medium intensity land use here and then urban high intensity. South of Grant street. On the zoning map, we can see that urban high intensity area, zone c three four here for the Umi area that was to the southwest over here, the community, commercial. This is all four reals. But the surrounding majority of the zoning on this aerial shows it to be our two single family residence district. This area was zoned pr five, which is a derivative of the r five high density, multifamily residence district under today's zoning classification, and the rezoning was done in stages in the 1980s. The plat here delineates the last area that was rezoned from c three to this PR overlay district. This area here had been originally a single family residence type zoning, and then all of it was made to be printed in the 1980s. The original acreage consisted of 18.27 acres. This plat was completed in 1986. The proposal is to create two lots of record lot one and lot two. Lot one primarily for the independent living units, of which there are 40 present at the current level. Permission have been given under the print five overlay district to build an additional 85 units. Lot two consists of the nursing care facility. There are 79 beds. There could be up to 81 beds or units built on lot two out. Lot a contains a detention basin as well as other infrastructure related to stormwater. Structures right now are compliant under the current r five zoning. Essentially, outline a was brought in here to deal with the stormwater detention basin, which is approximately right here. It also incorporates a drainage easement and a sanitary sewer easement. The square footages on lot one are met even at full build out at 3241 each unit, when only 1500 land space is required for each unit in multifamily for the addition. Up here for the nursing care facility, 3162 land space per each unit is provided when only 1500 square feet is required per each unit, so the density requirements are made. The height of the structure here on lot two as well, is within compliance. Ten stories is the upward limit in an five reals district. Utility connections are found throughout pretty much along 27th and 26th streets, Grant street, and then some other areas of the perimeter here in Roberts, but essentially everything is intact and there isn't any at this time. Plans for expansion of these areas to give you a better perspective on what is at stake here. Thoroughfare plan and access is a key element to this, the area that is lot two. These people who own this lot will have care and maintenance responsibilities for this easement. And this easement is essentially this asphalted drive that starts on 27th street and meanders its way down through the development", "answer_v2": "[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Bettendorf, IASNf Propco, LLC\",\n    \"positives\": [\n      \"Proposing to replat the currently existing Masonic Village to better delineate lots and improve development.\",\n      \"The new plat includes independent living units and a nursing care facility.\",\n      \"Plans to build an additional 85 units for independent living.\",\n      \"Compliance with urban zoning and density requirements.\",\n      \"Use of land for necessary infrastructure like stormwater detention and sewer easements.\"\n    ],\n    \"negatives\": [],\n    \"decision\": \"buy\",\n    \"comment\": \"The company is on a progress track with plans for expansion and infrastructure improvements, making it an attractive investment opportunity.\"\n  }\n]", "esg_v1": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Bettendorf, IASNf Propco, LLC\",\n        \"insights\": [\n            {\n                \"observation\": \"The proposal is to replat the current Masonic Village into two lots of record and one outline, with outlines related to infrastructure including a detention basin for stormwater management.\",\n                \"classification\": \"E\",\n                \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"observation\": \"The future land use for the area is public semicublic and urban low intensity.\",\n                \"classification\": \"E\",\n                \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"observation\": \"Lot one will have independent living units and has permission to build an additional 85 units.

Plans for expansion of these areas to give you a better perspective on what is at stake here. Thoroughfare plan and access is a key element to this, the area that is lot two. These people who own this lot will have care and maintenance responsibilities for this easement. And this easement is essentially this asphalted drive that starts on 27th street and meanders its way down through the development until it exits out here at grant. Now, this is a total entry exit as well as we see up here on 27th street. But this is asphalted concrete, and it will be the responsibility of the nursing care facility lot owners to maintain and repair this access. People on lot one will have a different aspect in dealing with this and that they will maintain this area here, which is, some of it, a wild drainage area. And then also there is a detention basin right here. That's going to be their responsibility. As we look here at the pedestrian access, there is a sidewalk that is actually contained on the property and that is met out with an easement 15ft wide to have that five foot wide sidewalk essentially in place. There is no anticipation of any other sidewalk being built along here on 27th street. And then eventually this becomes 26th street as it meanders closer here to the west. And as I mentioned before, there's a detention basin here. This detention basin has to be maintained and kept by the owners, primarily of the lodge area and the independent living. It outlets down into this ravine. This ravine collects a great deal of water from the acreage further north and then conveys it through this drainage area, which is highly wooded. And then it comes down through this area, where eventually it is directed underneath Grant street and then toward the river, where there are two pumping stations where that outlets. Staff, in looking at this proposal, would recommend approval as it does meet with comprehensive plan goal d, provide housing options and reinvestment in existing neighborhoods as well. The two conditions that go along with that recommendation are the owners of lot one shall provide a caretaking agreement for out lot a to be presented with flatting documents for recording of the plat. The same is true for the owners of lot two, essentially to provide agreement that deals with the maintenance and repair of the paved access easement area connecting lots one and two. And these documents are to be provided that they shall be recorded with the planning documentation to be submitted as part of what will be recorded at the recorder's office and we make a recommendation for approval. As staff, I would ask, are there any questions? So the paved access easement area is a roadway, right? Yes. A private drive, but a shared private drive? That's correct. So don't we usually require it to be city street standards on a shared drive? It's a drive area. This is existing. Yeah. All this existing. They're just splitting the lot? Yeah. Is all they're doing. The subdivision is new. All the infrastructure, all the locations of all the buildings, the sidewalks, all that stuff. Exactly the same as it was prior. So it's really. The subdivision of the property is changing into two chunks instead of one big chunk. I have a question. We're looking at a plat and that's all we're deciding. Now, I understand that there's obviously a reason why the owners want to replat this property, and I find the potential for 85 additional units in the lower lot, the independent living lot. It's hard for me to envision that. So I guess my question is, if we get to that point, then we'll see a site plan and that will have to come before us again, correct? That's correct. I think what Mister Beck was doing was just trying to explain how dense or un dense the property is. We are aware of no additional development or no proposal for. Right. Future development that certainly could come, but that's not been shared with us. And I think that comment wasn't made as, hey, this is what's going to happen. It was just made to show you. Right. And there, there are two different purposes to these two different facilities, so it's logical that they would want to divide them. I understand that. And whatever happens next that comes here, then we'll talk about it. Chris would like to. Yeah. If anything happens next time, if I could just jump in. I've had Greg as well. We've had a lot of discussion with the applicant here and with their attorney. The reason for this is not to change anything or to change ownership even. The reason is that the applicant is financing through HUD, permanent HUD financing for the skilled nursing portion of this facility. And one condition of the financing is that there can't be any other improvement on that, on that type of, on that lot. So they had to split the skilled nursing from the non skilled nursing. And so it's simply splitting it for that purpose. There's no, presently there's no understanding that they're going to sell it or change it. The ownership will remain the same. That's the intention at this point. And so that's sort of the impetus behind this request to split the lot. All right, that makes a lot of sense. And so the discussion of the potential for 85 additional units is just saying that it fits in with the r five density. That's how you're bringing that up, right.

It doesn't mean that it is even viable because there are so many other standards that would have to be met for setbacks between the structures. And that also for the infrastructure needed to support those types of buildings would make it probably far less of a development than what they just were looking at an upward number. They do meet all of the standards as of right now for five reals zoning. And even with the additional units, they would, if they can, meet the site development plan requirements. So that's all that was to point out what this agreement was for the pr five. Thank you. Anyone in the audience? Oh, go ahead, Roy. Yes, I had the same question. I was looking at the same thing and said, well, what's the long game here? But the practical side of it too is that the grade up there is extreme. And I think from a practical standpoint they probably developed the most developable portion of that one lot that's being separated. The rest of it is basically into the hill. And it would take some substantial engineering changes to make that work, or demolition of some existing buildings to put up a much bigger building, which is very expensive. So can you, sir, just a couple quick questions. I guess the HUD financing part, I'm a little. Oh yes. Questionable on. Who are we talking? Oh, I'm sorry. Dan McGarvey, 831 25th street. Thank you.

That's the applicant. It's the same applicant. Well, yeah, they could. It's their point. You know, it's their decision to sell in the future. But that's not the intention at this point. And they've made that representation to us. Okay. As far as the HUD financing goes, why can't they just have it all under the HUD? You said something about. And this is where I got kind of lost. I was trying to explain the reason why they're doing this because I think there was some confusion perhaps on why it's been represented to us that the reason that they're doing this is that they want this permanent HUD financing and it only is only for the skilled nursing facility. And one of the conditions of the financing is that there can't be any other type of facility on that lot. So they're refinancing what will be lot two, which only contains the skilled nursing portion of their property. Okay. So that by saying that, they're saying that down the road they may be improving the lower portion, then. Am I misunderstanding? Yeah. No, they're not. They're not changing anything. They simply needed to split the land into two lots so that the skilled nursing facility was separated from the non skilled use. That's where my confusion was. The second, by changing the plat, is that going to allow any development on the wooded drainage area? That area right now is designated for detention, which is about located here. And then there's an easement that runs through here and this area right now as an outlet is not considered buildable. Okay. Because it is sectioned out from the areas. If it would have been included as part of lot one, there was potential maybe for that, but it was not included. All right, thank you for your time. I appreciate it. Thank you. Right. Any other questions or comments from anyone? No. All right with that. Anyone care to make a motion? Mister chairman, I'll move to approve case number 240 one nine. Subject to any staff recommendations. Second. All right, we have a motion in a second. All those in favor say aye. Opposed? Same sign. Motion carries. All right, thank you, chairman. Our next case on the agenda is 240 two eight. This is Blom Huffington. Final plat, a little background. The applicant is Brian Buck Blong. Request is for a final plat for a four lot subdivision. This was recently rezoned from a one to two reals, just a portion of this area east of Middle Road, just south and accessible by Tanglewood Road. The platte creates two new developable lots for single family homes. Taking a look at the future land use and zoning, our currently adopted future land use map designates this area's urban medium intensity and parks and open space in the floodplain of Crow creek. And the current zoning now is single family residential. And a one to our agricultural district noted that Crow Creek floodplain exists on the eastern half of the property. Taking a look at the proposed plat shouldn't be any surprises here. This was the concept for the rezoning. The area zoned r two contains smaller lots two, three in out lot a, and then the area zoned a one contains lot one. This will remain a horse farm house. The plat and the plat complies with the book zoning standards for this district. Out lot a will be owned and maintained by lot two. Owner. No development is allowed in this lot. It's in the floodplain, and then the floodplain is delineated on the final plat, just to note.

And I can take any questions? Okay. Any questions? Commission? No. No. All right, we have one person in the audience speak. Yes, that is you. Okay. All right then, mister chairman, I'll move for approval of case 240. Two eight subject to staff recommendations a second. All right, we have a motion in a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? Same sign. Motion carries. Thank you. You're welcome. Our next. I'll present on the next two cases in one presentation, 24 29 and 24 00:30 this is a final plat replat of FGed holdings, fifth edition, and then a site development plan for lot one of that fifth edition. The background applicant is Kevin Kellner. As mentioned, the final plat and site plan for the request. This is located in the northwest corner of the FJAD holdings, fourth edition. So this is the betplex. This is pretty much to the east. We have a detention pond, the west and another detention pond. And then to the south is that extra parking, that optional parking for the ora that only will develop if they need it. So that's what that rectangle is. So this is just being split into two pretty much evenly sized lots. And the site plan will be on the south side of this. The proposed uses for that site plan are retail and automotive services. Brief look at the future land use and zoning currently adopted. We have community commercial future land use designation and c three general business zoning. Both of these are. Both the uses are permitted in the zoning and the bulk standards are met by that plat as well. This is the reference plat. Lot five is up here, and then the proposed plat. As mentioned, the two lots are virtually the same size. Access is provided by a combined utility access easement. There is a cul de sac, for lack of a better term, radius, that goes into the northern lot and then also provides access to the detention pond to the east, and then will allow access for future development for either an access or a road for future development north of that sports complex. So remember, the sports complex is on lot. It's four of the fourth edition, and there is some land to the north of there that can be developed. So at some future point they could replat that lot, and then you'd have a little bit of a. You'd have enough access road or room to put an access point for more customer access, I believe. And then you'd have more utility or employee access to the eastern side. And also mentioned on this plat there. No detentions needed. It's all provided off site to those reference detention pods. So as staff mentioned, all bulk standards are met, size setbacks, et cetera, and access. Looking at the site plan, this is the southern lot, lot one. Two access points are shown onto that common access easement. A southern and northern one. A total of 72 parking spaces are shown based on the proposed uses in the square footage, roughly 9600 sqft. This is well above the requirement for our off street parking schedule. Schedule. There are drive thru doors, garage doors located in the center of the building. So that's intended for the auto use, the auto service use. So they do have a maneuvering room on the east and west side of this building. One screen dumpster is located in the southwest corner of the lot of the development area. And then also mentioned is stormwater detention is provided off site site. Taking a look at the landscape plan, proposed development shows a total of 17 and a half tree factors. This meets our requirements. And then this is also a variation of tree species as proposed, which is consistent with the contemplated landscape code changes. So less maple trees. Basically. Given that, staff recommends approval of case number 24 29, final plat for FG holdings, fifth edition. And case number 24, site development plan for lot one, FG, 85th edition. I can take any questions. Thank you, Taylor. Any questions from anyone on this? I was just curious. It says that there's going to be a screened dumpster. Usually we see like dumpster enclosure. Same thing. Okay. Dense panels. Typically what they do, sometimes they do concrete way too much. There's usually a fence screening and then the dumpster itself. Any other questions? Yeah, I've always got a question. Is there no drive through facility contemplated here? Does, I'm not seeing any queue or anything. This is not set up for drive thru. Drive through is in there. As far as the garage doors you could drive through. Correct. But that drive into for service. But not a drive through. Not a drive through in relation to drive through. Restaurant.

Those opposed? Same sign hearing? None. Motion carries. And. Okay, that's that completes our cases for tonight. And staff would like to then move in to continue our, where we left off from our last meeting. We had our kind of agenda for that meeting completed, the going through our downtown master plan. We had some very good conversation with Jeff Ryder, our assistant administrator and economic development director. And we got to what I believe we've kind of got into chapter our land use chapter, chapter two in our cop plan. And then we kind of had to take a break. We kind of left off there. So I thought was to start there again. I know not all we're able to attend, but I would like to share, we were able to share kind of a summary to committee the whole on Monday with council of the changes that are occurring to the plan. Kind of just if you're given the plan, what's changed? What is it changing? So we wanted to share that with the commission and then we can kind of go into more details. Okay, sounds good. All right, I'm going to tee it up for you if you go to the next slide and then Taylor will kind of take you through the details and we're. I'll just. I think we have kind of a hourish that we were willing to spend on this tonight. We'll go as far on this as you want to go and if we need to meet again, we're happy to do that. You can't actually make a vote to approve it tonight anyway because you have to have a public hearing to do that. With that said, I think there's kind of six key updates that are important for you to keep in mind as you try to digest this, this big document. And those are the future land use map. The annexation map. Those are the two most important, in my opinion, the important pages in the book. Those are the tool that we use when we look at rezonings or potential annexations, both of which you guys have been through recently. And those are the most regulatory aspect of the book. The book is mainly a plan. It's mainly in generalization of what we would like to do. But the future land use map and the annexation map are more regulatory in their nature and are used to make those decisions in both our zoning decisions and annexation decisions. Number three is the appendix that charts the changes from why the map changed from what it was to what it is now. If you remember, we had an old ball field that was a private ball diamond on a certain corner in town and that was accidentally left as a ball field in the future land use map. That was a mistake, but we had to go through some real pain to prove that out. This annexation or this appendix, I should say kind of makes that go away. You have this legislative history, so I think that's really, to use Ann's term last time, that's really important. Adds a huge amount of functionality to the tool. The new sub area studies or sub area reports are parts of town. We have a lot of growth or potential growth or want to see change or grow. I'll let you thumb through those yourself, but they do provide some neat ideas on how we might develop. I'm really excited about Duck Creek Heights and I think there's some potential to improve that area and make a nice neighborhood. We worked really hard in aligning with other plans. So behind the scenes, the downtown master plan, the parks master plan, all those other city plans, they all say the same thing now. They don't say you don't have a different future land use map in your downtown plan than you do in your comprehensive plan. They're all the same. So we don't get that dissonance. And then we updated the action items. Those items were updated because many of the things were done. Think about this plan. It was done before I 74 bridge. It was really done before TbK. It was really done before Forest Grove park. So a lot of those action items were just updated naturally. What didn't change? I can go to the next slide. The overarching goals, the vision and mission statement of the city of Bettendorf, those remain the same. So we're planning up the same basis, the same foundation, if you will. We didn't change the goals that had been set in the previous plan.

We worked really hard in aligning with other plans. So behind the scenes, the downtown master plan, the parks master plan, all those other city plans, they all say the same thing now. They don't say you don't have a different future land use map in your downtown plan than you do in your comprehensive plan. They're all the same. So we don't get that dissonance. And then we updated the action items. Those items were updated because many of the things were done. Think about this plan. It was done before I 74 bridge. It was really done before TbK. It was really done before Forest Grove park. So a lot of those action items were just updated naturally. What didn't change? I can go to the next slide. The overarching goals, the vision and mission statement of the city of Bettendorf, those remain the same. So we're planning up the same basis, the same foundation, if you will. We didn't change the goals that had been set in the previous plan. Those are the same. We just updated the actions related to them because some of them got done. And this concept of development character areas is still part of the plan and I think that's an important part and works out to continue those and maybe update that concept in the future zoning ordinance that we're going to change. So as you talk, as we talk tonight, or you look at this offline, those are six things to keep in mind. We went through most of chapter one last time, but I'll let Taylor go as deep into the slides as he wants to go. But chapter one, really, there's eight chapters, maybe nine, but that's almost half of the book. So you got through chapter one, you got through future land use and you got through annexation for the most part. So you really did the heavy lift. Taylor, if you want to do the rest of the slides, I'm. Yeah, I can just briefly touch. Mark covered it pretty much all. But we went over the future land use map. Key point here is we talked about this at our last meeting, but this aligns with our annexation map alignment alignment. So we have areas, especially in our east of Criswell area and north of I 80 area, there's alignment. We have two new land use areas, or designations, that we're calling it neighborhood commercial. But I can kind of. I'll show you that in a second. Our potential walkover table and then our conservation subdivision area. The annexation map has changed. We've talked about this. We have an eastern area now, an expanded northern area. Mark touched on that legislative history. Why we're changing it. We've had many iterations of this map through draft mode. We've gone, we've scratched off the areas that were initially, well, we had business park for north of ad in our currently adopted one. Now we're changing that to residential transitioning into greenway transitioning into to mixed high commercials. So lots of changes there. Just explaining those changes. The five sub areas, some are undeveloped, kind of just microcosms of the future land use map with more finite suggestions. And then the downtown overlay district has pretty much its own master plan, the Duck Creek Heights, which is our Magnolia Hawthorne Parkway area, some specific suggestions for increased connectivity, improving aesthetics and character. And then Mark mentioned all the plans. These are all, these are just all of them. There's just a example of some of the plans that have been updated since our last comp plan in 2017. So there's a lot of action happening, and not only in the cities, through other departments and public Works Administration, through the strategic plan, our parks department. We also have by state who does our regional clone range, transportation plan. We have our sets, community economic development, comprehensive economic development plan, downtown master plan, go on and on. So these are all aligned. It feeds into the comp plan. And this alignment encourages collaborative planning through different departments, agencies, the cities in the area, and then our action items. This is how it's structured. So we kind of went through most of chapter one. Chapter two is going to just have some suggested actions. It's our focus area chapter. So it's got suggested actions for at least one for each focus area. Downtown has the most of them, but at least there's one suggested action or policy. Could be another maybe corridor plan such as the Mill Road corridor area, kind of a master plan for the Indiana north of 80 area. So we do have that future land use map. But remember, that's a fuzzy map. It's very, it's for the whole city outside the city. When you're looking specific at smaller geographies, you start master plan. These finite details, kind of like a site plan per se, but somewhere in between that. And it can help drive the city's vision for that particular area, which will be very key because it's the doorstep, our northern doorstep from I 80. So pretty important. I did want to share something that came up at our last meeting, was kind of, how will this plan, all the change in land uses, how will they. How does that work? From a code to a land use comp plan to code? So our current adopted land uses are on the far left column, we have urban low intensity, urban high medium intensity, and urban high intensity, which are the same names as the zoning district, which is very confusing. So what do we do? We went out and changed those, and that crosses over to neighborhood light mixed transitional urban activity. Another change was adding an additional commercial land use. So you can see that we did use the same name. That might be confusing. I think that this shows that that neighborhood commercial is the lightest of the three commercial land uses. That service commercial is that medium one. And then the community commercial is still the highest intensity for larger regional type of attractions, etcetera. All the other ones remain the same.

That service commercial is that medium one. And then the community commercial is still the highest intensity for larger regional type of attractions, etcetera. All the other ones remain the same. There was a rural agricultural one that wasn't used, honestly, it was in code, so we're not going to prolong that. That's kind of how it's set up from the land use perspective. The next step that we don't have fleshed out, but we will be proposing in the next month, at least a kind of a draft version, is how will these compatible zoning districts align to these new land uses. So if you have a neighborhood light district, historically, you are allowed to have, you know, it's r1.02 reals single family zoning, or your DCA, of course. So we have to cross over that table, and that's how this cop plan will walk over to code. So when you look at a proposed rezoning, is this consistent with the comprehensive plan and the future land use map? This table really helps to help you. You had a table like this in the past? Yep. It's currently in our preamble overseas. It's really helpful. So it's kind of an odd place for it. And Chris and I have discussed and with Mark as well, kind of how will we walk that over? And we think this is pretty integral to have at least some update, updated version of this. We might be able to update it, version 1.1, and then update it once we're all done. With the zoning code update. But we need to have some update just to at least recognize the new land use designations because it'll take some time to update the code and we'll get proposals that will come in between. There's not a really good alternative, in my opinion, other than stopping. The term I use is a crosswalk. You need to crosswalk between the new comp plan and the old zoning code and this crosswalks between the two until we get the new zoning code updated with all the things we want, want to do there. And I think there'll be some proposed, you know, with the three kind of commercial land uses versus the previous two. I mean, I think c, one commercial, which is our lightest zoning district, would obviously fit into the lowest neighborhood commercial land use. What would fit? I know that the last meeting was discussed, should all residential be banned from, you know, that those corner lots that are designated for commercial or should like a five reals type of use be considered some higher rise buildings. So all those things can be discussed, but just from a zoning district level, I think we still have our dcas which allow kind of the master plan mentality, form based code. And that's when you submit that plan, everything is kind of on paper, but then you stick to that plan or amend it with council and commission's approval. And that's just a summarization. So those are, that's all there. Industrial is going to transfer to industrial. But one discussion point there is, we've seen a lot of light industrial things such as like contractor condos or indoor storage, that really has very few negative externalities. You can't even tell what's going on there actually. Is that appropriate for maybe a use that could be in like maybe a high commercial area? So the things that are kind of bridging over from the industrial to the commercial greenways, parks, I mean, those are going to be consistent with their last ordinance, I believe. But just some thoughts, just thinking about how that, this is how it transfers. So we kind of designated our land uses and how we'll have to address it. And just to be clear, this is not, this is just for your thought. This is not in your plan. This is just for your, you know, to understand how we'll go from one to the other. This is not something we're adopting or doing anything with yet besides sharing with you that crosswalk. But this is planned to be brought to the commission at the next. In the, in the May. At the May meeting. It'll probably, it'll have to be a zoning orchids. It's in the, literally the preamble, the very first paragraph of the zoning ordinances. That's where it lives. I guess I didn't want you to think that we've already decided all this. We have to write a staff report on what we suggest for the zoning. I mean, the future land uses are definitely decided, but that's what the map. That's how that map translates. It's largely, though, mechanical, isn't it? I mean, you've changed the names of these land use categories, and it's just on those fringes where, like, the highest commercial and the lowest industrial or the lowest, you know, those are just some of the. The proposed changes and then the new neighborhood commercial. Yep. Okay, so not very many integral changes. And that still preserves the uses that are allowed within those zoning districts. So you have the zoning, you have the land use, which allows certain zoning districts. You have zoning districts that allow certain uses. So the use table has to be updated. And we have uses that are not contemplating our current code that we want to add. Like, we have coffee shops, for instance, which brings. Those are classified as restaurants in our current code.

So just want to touch on that. But we can go back to the compl things. Are you adding in different new and different things for those? Yeah. Well, and that's what we want to get to. After we get the comp plan we want, we'll open the whole code up. There's some RDG suggested some other uses that are modern uses. I guess that we just haven't updated our code to combining uses. All these different. Some uses aren't around anymore. So that's another thing we'll be addressing for sure. When we do, we just can't do it. Same work session. We do a cop plan, because we don't enough time. One thing at a time. Okay, so, Mark, I guess I can open up the questions, or I'll open up the plan. And if you guys have questions, chapter two, that's kind of where we are. If you want to jump in there, ask questions, we'd say just like we did at the last meeting, just dive in and we'll interrupt. And Roy is still there. I'm here. So it starts with the downtown overlay district. This is probably the most vetted of these subarea studies because it's part of the downtown master plan study, which was done and has been shared with you and Mister Ryder presented on that it will be adopted officially when we adopt the future land use plan. And so I don't want to go through Jeff's presentation because it was pretty long, but it does divide the downtown up into four or five segments and kind of proposes areas for redevelopment, those being Westbridge, Eastbridge Riverfront and Pratt Promenade area and an industrial area as well. But the future land use map that's in here is the same. That's in here. This is on page 65 is the same. That's in the downtown master plan. So if we had a developer looking at one or the other, they would get the same information. To me that's a huge hit because it wasn't that way before and it caused us problems. Not a ton, I would say from Jeff's presentation that I would say to change because it hasn't been that long. But I'm happy to answer questions on the downtown master plan focus area, if you had them. I will remind you that you are the review committee for the downtown master plan as far as architectural elements. So when we do get a downtown project, the downtown master plan, and they're kind of noted here, have some pretty specific architectural elements that have to be met. You can't put plastic siding on a hundred year old building, for example. We wouldn't allow you to do that. So. And I'll note the. As far as just the actions in this chapter, a few of the downtown ones were kept from the last plan. And then a couple, the railway corridors was one of them was added. That kind of goes into the quiet zone, which is golden cities and. But also it really maintaining connectivity between the riverfront and our. We're calling our promenade or just kind of our center core of downtown between Grant and State street. We're kind of just right across the street here. So maintaining connectivity. We have the George Dean Bridge, but we also that we have 12th street, which is a at grade crossing future, potentially might have a letdown structure of some sort. Potentially that's on hold. So that was one and then enhanced an update. Leach park that was noted previous parks plan and it's still kind of on the schedule, but it might be. Jeff kind of went into a lot of detail about that in the downtown master plan. So I won't. Redundant. So that was another addition. Any questions on the. I mean, Duck Creek Heights is really. May I just interject a couple comments? Yep, go ahead. There are two things that I found really interesting in the downtown residential section. One was that the city should be looking for a demonstration project for future housing to try to encourage more housing projects down there. And also there was a section on neighborhood transition and mindfulness of moving from the downtown area into the residential areas and making that a smooth transition. I mean, the neighborhoods are already there, but as they change, I think that's really important. And then that made me wonder. You just referenced the park, which is at the west end of downtown. Well, we have Leech park, and then we have Rocket park is what I call the other park. Are you talking about Meyer park? Yes. No, not Meyer Park. McManus park. Has there ever been any discussion about maybe a pocket park down at this end of the town? So we've got Beatleite. I don't know if you've seen that. It is. It is a park. I'm thinking more like in the community center area. Oh, well, there's a park right above sunny Crest. Yeah. Okay. It is not regularly used, but it is there. But as. As housing increases downtown. Well, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's more used than I think, but it seems to be kind of hidden behind the community center. I didn't know. But don't forget we also have under the bridge, we have the urban park, which is still kind of coming into its own.

And then that made me wonder. You just referenced the park, which is at the west end of downtown. Well, we have Leech park, and then we have Rocket park is what I call the other park. Are you talking about Meyer park? Yes. No, not Meyer Park. McManus park. Has there ever been any discussion about maybe a pocket park down at this end of the town? So we've got Beatleite. I don't know if you've seen that. It is. It is a park. I'm thinking more like in the community center area. Oh, well, there's a park right above sunny Crest. Yeah. Okay. It is not regularly used, but it is there. But as. As housing increases downtown. Well, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's more used than I think, but it seems to be kind of hidden behind the community center. I didn't know. But don't forget we also have under the bridge, we have the urban park, which is still kind of coming into its own. So under that bridge, there's some stone and some trails and trying to create that as a place. Again, not sure. I apologize. I wasn't at that work session. I wasn't able to go. But not sure how much information Jeff gave you on the Leach park rebuild that's being worked on with the. The west bridge master plan. It's a fairly significant expansion of the park, you know, beyond what's actual park amenities, I think would be the easiest way to put it. The footprint of the park or what's at the park. Say it again. The footprint of the park itself or just the amenities. The footprint of the park. Yeah. That, I think would solve a lot of what you're talking about. Good. That's great. All right. That's all I wanted to say, too. And I also note that getting into parks that are currently undergoing a park's master plan update that just kind of isn't, I don't know, early stages or mid early stages. You made a comment about the importance of transitioning into the neighborhood up the hill, and I think if you look at page 65, you'll see that we go from an Orlando's perspective, we go from red. So just let's call that more intense to orange, to yellow as you move up the hill. So we were intentional about that. Probably not perfect, but, you know, we tried to, but that's important. Yeah. And I think the development trend has shown, has followed this pretty much so far. After the realignment of Grand State street, especially farther west, I don't think you're seeing as much. We did have a rezoning, actually on a one lot house, so that could happen, but not in bunches, I guess. Any other questions on chapter two I can cover? I mean, the basic. I think the Duck Creek Heights is more of a. It's kind of our first. It really revolves around physical character. So you're talking about maybe acquiring one lot to increase connectivity between streets. The network is just kind of not there parks. There are some out lots or vacant land, I believe. I'm not sure what it's used for. Along the Interstate 74 area that could be used as maybe a neighborhood park or. Or parking amenities like off street parking. And then there is a neighborhood park associated with it, which is from flood buyouts. So there's a lot of different ideas. The housing stock there is really. It's there. It just needs some. Those kind of physical improvements surrounding it. So, yeah, it's not budgeted. So a lot of interesting things on this page that cost money. We get to plan. We don't necessarily have to budget what's in this plan. These are maybe highfalutin ideas, but you'll see like potential adding a trail that goes from Duck Creek Heights down to the buyout area where we're going to have a future park someday. That's kind of on the west side of that little call out. They talked about maybe adding a sidewalk that is more of an off street sidewalk that is kind of behind the homes or between the homes and then really addressing the neighborhood's lack of parking. We would probably have to do some street work, maybe some right away acquisition striping at a minimal to make that work. But those streets aren't striped like that. The area functions so poorly because it does not have enough parking. We would not build a neighborhood this way. It is under parked. It was approved back when there was one car per home and now there's two or three cars per home. So trying to just address those infrastructure issues. If money were no option or not an obstacle, we would maybe be able to do all these things. We'd probably have to implement these over time when we had willing sellers and were able to acquire some ground and do some of these things. So I wanted to cover that as far as the middle road corridor, the IED interchange and then our eastern annex area. It's just really looking at their undeveloped areas. So maybe the IED has tbk to the south, but just looking at how to integrate smart land use is really an integration transitioning. So it's just kind of a level on that. But everybody needs some other developments to come in to kind of predict where as far as connectivity goes, street alignments, all that. I think we'll. Once we get something, especially on the northern, between Hopewell and Forest Grove, we do have one development coming in, but as morgue, we can kind of see that Brent's department as far as street network and things of that nature. Same thing goes for north of Indiana. Once we get sewer out there and there's a limited amount of streets, Indiana Avenue and Bar street and I think 56 or something. Yeah, it runs north south, one north south. Other than that, it's hilly and there's some right away that we needed. So and then the land uses are to kind of integrate with those slopes and then also floodplain. So and then our east annex area, which we covered before we have one annexation coming soon, and then east of Criswell, that would need sewer, but kind of integrating with already developed areas and then undeveloped areas and again, topography and networking.

So let's kind of reiterate all those things. Any questions on focus areas? Right, the next few chapters, economic development, housing don't have the actual table. They're mostly up just updates on statistics, demographics, huge changes from the last plan, I should say housing change, what it's talking about, because a lot has happened since between 2017 and now. Covid housing prices have increased dramatically. So that's reflected housing affordability is reflected in economic development. You know, it's really going back to what our strategic goals are from the strategic, strategic plan and identify as emerging commercial areas, which we're very well aware. I think this commission kind of looks at what's coming in and out of Bedendorf, Scott county and how it compares state. I don't know if there's any specific things I want to point out that are new. It does highlight, you know, the updates of the TDK area and then just kind of updates some of the maps, the emerging, existing, emerging commercial. So some of them were emerging in the last plan and now we're putting as existing TVK would be one of them. We've kind of got over 50%, roughly 50% of that developed. I would say the west side and we're being the east side is probably mostly approved by now for this commission. We just did another project tonight. There's not really many lots left out there for. No, not many. So there's some on Forest Grove Drive and maybe a couple to the north. A couple to north, but yeah. So. And then you have some of the development to the west of that. Yeah, I mean, point interrupt if you have anything to interject, but I don't expect so much comments from this section. I'm a little curious how you guys feel like, the maneuverability or around the sports complexes like the vet plex, finding, you know, their businesses that you're looking for and getting from one area to the next. You feel like you like the way it's turned out or as far as, like, through the parking lot area, driving from one, you know, business. I think the east side is a much better layout. I think. I think Kevin would probably agree that the west side, some of the parking lot configurations, drive lanes, weave in and out, and they go from two way to one way and angle parking and head on parking. You know, they kind of dealt with what everything was built around, how big tbk itself took, and it just didn't leave enough room up against Forest Grove, you know, really pinched some of that. So I don't think it was ideal. I think the east side is a much better layout coming together. Better, yeah. And if you've taken a drive, even at this point through that, what's going to be iron t way? You know, the main entrance through there, you know, it's three lanes wide, straight shot in. It's really going to function at a much better level. I think when I take my nerdy planter hat off and just experience it as a citizen for a weekend, and I had family that had kids came and played ball games there, and they played until one in the morning, I found that I. That we went there and we parked, and once we got parked, we were done with the car, you know. So did you find it Walker friendly then? Yeah, once. Once you're in. We didn't. We didn't go back. Back to the car to do anything. Now they ended up not being able to stay in a hotel on site, which will be changing because we're building hotels on site. Not we, but developers are building hotels on site. So the family had to get in the car. The only reason they had to get in the car is because they didn't have hotel room to stay in. And, you know, so eight baseball, ten baseball kids stayed some other hotel because the one there was full of other baseball kids or softball kids. This case may be so, but yeah, my experience just as a person just going there for a tournament for a weekend, we parked the car and we were done with it. Yeah. So we walked in and mainly used the interior between the diamonds. It was during outdoor baseball season. So pedestrian accommodations will get better, let's put it that way. With the ped bridge, there's additional walks that are going to get added to provide a better level of connectivity. And then I think at some point as Forest Grove landing develops and competition gets extended, there will be a call for additional connectivity. Let's say west of the main entrance into TbK, if you want to call it that, the east north south driveway. It's right where the Tesla Chargers. And we've got some good crosswalks right in that area. We've worked with them to get some extensions a little further west. They dedicated some striping through the parking lot to try to give a clear path to get you to the front door at the entertainment center. But we still don't have a lot west of there. You don't need it right now, but we will in the future. And it's something we're keeping an eye on. And the Penn Bridge, like I said, will have a lot of additional connectivity being provided through that project.

Like say if you use Google Maps or Apple. Yeah, that's a. That's a tough thing for next time you see Kevin and or Adam sites, make a suggestion. And there's no special. There's no special sign requirements from our. From the city standpoint. Some special district. I believe Kevin has some like review or something more restrictive review requirements on. So they can't make everything look the same character. Is there a combined. Every time you drive around, you find something new. It's kind of fun. Like the milk in the back of the store. You gotta make the journey. Actually it was nice when we had our detour. Kevin built temporary sign. Yeah. And it was very clear. I did see that. Yeah, that was entrance. This entrance. And it was actually pretty convenient. Can we leave that up there? Yeah. And then I've seen the proposed development for Bush. Was that like west of the ball fields, equestrian fields and that whole area looks like it's going to be really cool too. Like as far as like this is what happens when Kevin goes on vacation. We spend his money, continue connectivity over there. It's going to be cool. Could make a list to do list for him while he's going. Maybe. As we kind of put chapter three aside. Just look again at figure 3.4. It's a commuting patterns figure. But it also has a note associated with it. And the note says, numerous employees struggle to find housing that meets their needs in Bettendorf, leaving them to commute from surrounding communities. I think that's an important statistic as you look at how many people live in Bettendorf or work in Bettendorf, but don't live in Bettendorf. That. Yep. At the bottom of the page there. Contemplate that for a little bit. It shows you to me that is a graphic that tells you why we see the number of townhomes, duplexes and apartments that keep coming to this commission. You know, it's not as if staff are out recruiting these things. This is what the markets. Amanda, you talking about? You're right there. Okay, good. All right. Figure 3.4 on the bottom of page 84. And so that's probably that market demand, especially if you're working at places like the Betplex. That's maybe more of an entry level job. Their ability to afford a home in Bettendorf for purchase is pretty, pretty difficult. So I think that's why we see those apartments and townhomes and duplexes coming in. I think that mark, Roy, do we have any feel for what the breakdown is of the type of housing that's needed for the different categories? So, hey, if there were, you know, 500 apartment units or, you know, 150, whatever, just like we planned it. Roy helped me in that transition, man. Yeah. I think we should go to chapter four. It does take a lot of time to look into the housing. Yeah, there's. There's a lot of statistics and figures in this chapter. And Reg did pretty much rewrite this chapter. There's so many changes in the market and we've grown so much too with new census data, new survey data, ACS data, etcetera. I mean, just look at this figure right here. That north in 2010 was average. Medium home values at 164,000 jumped up to $244,000 for 2021. I mean, it's a huge jump. It's growing. The Delta's growing from between Benton north and Scott county. And we've always been higher than the median for Iowa. So some changes in rents, median gross rent as well. As far as Roy, his question is 97. That might someone, he was asking. Yeah, so this is what, and this is reiterated in multiple sections of the plan. Beginning part of the plan looks at more of a. This is a land use. This is actually, sorry. This is a total number of units. But in the earlier part of the plan, we suggest we look at land use. You know what certain land uses lead to certain products. This is products. And today we have a single family community, single family, detached, I should say. It's grown, it's gone down, but it's still predominant based on RDG's work and our trends for projected growth and our affordability and our land use consumption rate, all those things combined, the target is still to get to like a 20% either attached, which are like your villa style or your townhomes. So you're. That's what we see. We're seeing more of. But the more housing we get, it's going to take a while to get to 20%. Can you, when you're done there, can you go just page 96 just right over?

So you're. That's what we see. We're seeing more of. But the more housing we get, it's going to take a while to get to 20%. Can you, when you're done there, can you go just page 96 just right over? Yep. And I will put, I will say the caveat. I have had some comments on this graph. I think it needs a little more explanation. And I'm going to. Once you know how to read it. Yeah, get that. There's three lines there. There's a line for household income in blue. There's a line in gray for affordable homes for those people in blue above it, I'm just looking at the very top. And then there's a line in red for affordable rentals. And so it's kind of, it gives you a range, and within that income range, it shows you the supply each time. But rentals come up as. Don't worry about the range, but just look how affordable rentals come up as undersupplied. How many times you see the word undersupplied relative to affordable rentals, even for the highest income earners, people are sometimes confused, but a lot of times people are renting because they're on their way somewhere else. They have aged out of their home and they're going to rent until they move in to wherever that next spot is. So we don't zone for rentals. It's not something we zone for, but we often. You are often asked the question, is it going to be a rental? At every category? The data would say you need rentals at even the top earning category, which is sometimes counterintuitive. And the background of this graph, really, the analysis is, I'll try to summarize. It is looking at medium income values and medium housing prices. Those are for rents and for owner occupied, and really looking at anything over 30% of that income is unsustainable. So that kind of moves people down the bracket of if you have, what, six different brackets here. And that's where those. The supply and demand gets really wonky. If people are getting moved down because the incomes are changing, but not as fast as the housing changing. So that's, if they get over 30%, then you have. That's an issue too. So that's kind of how this is developed, adding all that together, and that's sort of this affordability matrix. I think I had a question or a comment, something along the line of what you were just talking about that really supported, surprised me. We approved not that long ago, a duplex, attached ranch villas on Central Avenue, just down from Armstrong school. And I was really. They're very nice looking. And I was surprised to see that they were for sale because I thought that's a. There's more rentals in that neighborhood. And that's just what I expected. And, you know, there is more need for that. But in that particular case, that wasn't the choice. And that I just found that surprising. Yeah. Yeah. The numbers are. These two chapters are neat to kind of get into the numbers you can. Yeah, I mean, I think it accurately depicts, you know, what's going on. You ever had rental properties? Well, yes, I have. It's a lot more pleasurable to sell them than it is to rent them. Well, you can't really tell the owner what to do with their property. This gets into the numbers. Taylor, just for a minute, back on that 96 again, it just. Just to underscore what Mark said or emphasize it, I guess, a little more. When I look at the household income, more than 150,000 affordable renters is noted as $3,000. I'm assuming that plus a month, right? Yes, sir. And that is the largest undersupply category out of all the categories. Right. And so then you get what can happen. I'm not a real estate agent, but what can happen is you, you don't get your people, your, your aging population who are in their, you know, their four or five bedroom homes. They want to, they want to leave that home. They don't want another mortgage. They just want to rent until, you know, and vacation and do whatever they do in retirement. But then they're, they're not leaving that home because they don't have the rental to go to. They don't want to buy a 30 year mortgage that's not in their life plan anymore. And so you end up jamming up the supply of housing. You don't move the people out and give them a place to go and then that just down the line. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, we did get some comments to kind of help explain that data and some of these graphs a little cleaner. We can do that, though, with RDG's help. A lot of the same actions which were in the last plan or exist in this plan, this is actually one of the few actions that's broken into kind of a step process. But we're still encouraging the formation of neighborhood associations. Ben doesn't really have very many. We're aging as a city, but so we're getting to neighborhood groups, associations different from homeowners associations. But we're also continuing to incur the creation of those remainder of roads tensions where our CIP funds still have an allotment for improvements in older neighborhoods every year.

There are some recommendations and suggestions for incentivizing Enfield projects. They kind of give some development tools. These are all suggestions from RDG that they've seen from other communities and that they've worked in and then regulate and inspect rental properties to ensure property maintenance and safety. We're doing that. So it's kind of a, an easy check mark, but so there's some highlights and like some of these incentives are suggested. Now I want to also reiterate, the plan is a vision. The future land use map and that annexation map are very important because we have to be consistent with those in our zoning. But some of the suggestions, action items aren't mandates. They're not funded. This plan goes out to 2045. These aren't needed to be funded in next year's budget. This by no means means that this is just, these are suggestions. These are very overreaching, overarching visions for the city. What kind of incentives does Bettendorf currently have? I'm sorry, I didn't hear that. What kind of incentives does Bettendorf currently have? Incentives. We use Tiffany financing in certain parts of town. We also have, in our downtown area, we do have the Schmidt, which is basically a tax on yourself, your downtown business. You can voluntarily tax yourself for improvements in the downtown and there are grants available to that. And then with bi state regional commission, we have a revolving loan fund for small businesses that, because we're a part of bi state regional commission, that regional commission that we do use, those are the three off the top of my head, I don't do incentives. We kind of separate those duties because I'm a regular regulatory in nature. I'm a reviewer, I don't incentivize projects. Jeff Ryder, does our incentives work for the city? But some of these ideas that do exist in our communities that would be very novel to Bettendorf are simple as kind of creating these templates for different types of housing that allow it to be. The approval process is much more predictable. You know, you have through the commission, through council, through building permits, etcetera. I know the city of Ottumwa and some city of Dubuque have done similar projects like that. They've kind of picked a plan set. That's an idea that really doesn't cost the city money, per se, or just kind of giving it people a direction, because predictability is actually a big part of its incentive in a way. So that's just an example. That's suggested tiffs, of course, tax abatements, etcetera. Most of those are more economic development incentives. Not really housing development incentives. This would be novel. As Taylor said. This isn't really something that we've done. Yeah, but this was rewritten, so I wanted to point that out. Kind of. These are some newer concepts. So we're doing things like this on the commercial side, but this, to apply some of this perhaps to. I mean, that's the novel part of it. You have tips, I see single family homes, probably limited incentives available. Yeah. But when it becomes something like mixed use, mixed use development, just right over there, you know, where we had the old paddle wheel and the single room occupancy hotel, you know, there were incentives brought to bear for that. That helps with that redevelopment. But yeah, your single family home neighborhood, we're not going to tiff that. That's not what we do. But the novel part of this is we're talking about housing, right? Yeah, yeah. I mean, some housing incentives. Yeah. There's some of these examples from other communities. I just wanted to point those out. Sure. I just want to make a comment on housing, I'm going to say it because we need to say this. We need to be careful or something. There's two ways to get affordable housing. There's one, some sort of incentives, and I think we really got to be careful about those incentives and what comes with it. The other way is supply and demand, and that is supply and demand. You increase the supply and eventually the prices come down and the rents come down. From my perspective, the business incentives sound great, but housing incentives, I would be real cautious of us ever going down that route. Yeah, I think that would be reflected on council as well. Solid point. That covers thousands section. Any other general question? Like I said, it's more of a background data to kind of feed into the overall visions and actions. Two main sections left and then it's our implementation section. So we'll try to cover these quickly. Our community character, it kind of goes over the types of character we have as far as like transportation, you know, where corridors are, how we get around the city, our place character as far as play place, making signs, those nature, the green character, which is our parks really. And then the neighborhood character, different types of residential areas, how they're really related to each other. I'll just kind of skim through as far as we have, you know, we're talking about our downtown lighting, things of that nature on our transportation corridors, bricks. I mean, this goes.

cautious of us ever going down that route. Yeah, I think that would be reflected on council as well. Solid point. That covers thousands section. Any other general question? Like I said, it's more of a background data to kind of feed into the overall visions and actions. Two main sections left and then it's our implementation section. So we'll try to cover these quickly. Our community character, it kind of goes over the types of character we have as far as like transportation, you know, where corridors are, how we get around the city, our place character as far as play place, making signs, those nature, the green character, which is our parks really. And then the neighborhood character, different types of residential areas, how they're really related to each other. I'll just kind of skim through as far as we have, you know, we're talking about our downtown lighting, things of that nature on our transportation corridors, bricks. I mean, this goes. Some of this isn't a lot of this isn't public, honestly. It's a lot of private things in our residential subdivisions, but also in our community or our commercial areas to Nessa was mentioning kind of like signage, things of those nature. I think that kind of covers some of this. Our activity centers were updated. It's kind of like existing in of emerging commercial areas, but this kind of combines parks with where the people are, where the density is for activities. Downtown, our middle Cumberland Square area, Utica Ridge Middle Road, Devil's Glen and then kind of becoming more and more busy is our middle road, forest Grove. A lot of this was honestly reused from the last plan. This was an update, remember? So we're still. It's kind of an always. We're always trying to increase, enhancing our place character through our public art, plantings, landscaping, etcetera, community events, everything. I mean, it's all in here. They give you an example. We have our new pool which is referenced here, landing and going. This is our park section. I will note that we are undergoing the parks master plan update right now, so we'll probably have to. We will as best as we can with the knowledge we have now, this is what our parks plan, our existing and our future parks plan is. But we will have to probably update that to make these consistent and align. The parks plan will go in much more greater detail. We noted that the parks like north of I 80 are just kind of representation of acreage, not really site selected. And we make that note our future land use map page multiple times throughout the plan. That's being discussed much further under the microscope. And what's amenities in each park and all those different things. The visitor type demographics are mentioned in the parks master plan. So that will be updated. It's kind of scheduled to be adopted later this year, end of this year. Any questions? One of those action items is update the parks master plan. So, and we do have some sub plans like the forest grilled master plan as well that are suggested. If nothing there, I'll jump to the protect and maintain is a pretty short one, but pretty important. Basically looking at our sewer and water service, which has been a big deal, we're talking about growth. We're talking about all that growth, sewer access and we needed. We're building a lift station right now which provides sewer north of 80. We're looking at annexation area east of Griswell, which will need sewer. So that's all talked about upgrades, the system, storm water. We still have to with development and growth, we have to keep that, all those improvements, enhancing storm water system through ini projects, etcetera. And then also preserving sensitive areas, which is addressed in the future. Land use map. So those greenways are very important from preserving those from development to keep our stormwater connectivity and capacity high. Public safety is addressed as just kind of the same topic. It's brought up as with growth, we also kind of keep an eye on. We can provide the same services for that larger population, also provide homes for those people that are working in those service jobs. Not just our service jobs, but in the city, but schools as well. Teachers, kind of some common sense stuff, but it's important. Fire protection, fire facilities. That's awesome. All that information is in here. Police, fire, kind of. All those things were addressed in more detail. Taylor? Yep, go ahead. I think it was on the page you went right before this. It said, talked about preserving nature sensitive areas. Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know exactly what page you were on. Right here. Natural areas from development. Yep, that's the same. That's the development suitability map as a general guide. Yeah, I was just wondering what those areas were and how we decided which like, parts should be, in several cases recently, in the existing comp plan, there's that developable. Maybe you can go to the map. Ooh, 1.6. There's a map that just maybe to first interpretation, it looks like all this part of town can't be developed. And so we've tried to kind of soften that up, because it doesn't mean that. It just means where you do have certain soils, certain slopes, you're gonna have to do more engineering if you want to develop. And so we've tried to soften that map and that language associated with that map up a little bit. Still a guide, but it's not. But it's not a. It is not a deciding factor consideration. It's not a taking of somebody's development rights. It just tries to point out those areas. So we'll. We take those into consideration. We review the engineering that they're proposing. Maybe they're going to do some type of wetland bank or something like this. And I would suggest to use it as. It's really a combination of a flood plain map and a high slopes map, and a wetlands map and hydra soils map. And then just combining all those, you don't have to go reference all of these.

And I think it's overlooked. That's really what it is. And the slopes are, I think, 15%. We increased the slope range, because if you put the slopes at really low range, the whole city's right. This language, it is important to note that the map is a general guide site. Specific factors will dictate any future development activity. So that's just some language we tried to add in there, because we did have people that were interpreting this map as some type of, you know, absolute regulation you can't develop, because your. Your red on this map. And that's not appropriate. That's not how the map is used. Yeah, I think that is helpful, especially for citizens of Bettendorf, as they look at it. And they think, well, I bought land here because I thought this right here was never going to change. It was always going to be greenscape, or it's always going to be undeveloped, you know, and then it does. So. And we have areas that are in those red areas. We have. We have houses that are in floodways, and that was built at the time when they weren't regulated or, you know, things weren't. Wasn't known. So. And even with this, they'll always say that they'll do a certain contingent. They'll find something in the fine version, I'm sure. But I feel like it's helpful to have at least the language to reference. To reference for them. Like, I can see why you would think that, but here's some. You know, my realtor said that would always be a cornfield. Yeah, well, if you want it to always be a cornfield, you need to buy the cornfield. I think I need to. So that's. I would put it in big, bold font and underline it. Mark on that point, just because. Remember the case, I can tell you who came in actually, and made a point of that. We were kind of looking at each other and in black and white or red and white in this case. It was pretty apparent that there was an argument to me, but clearly our intent was what you described, that it's a guideline. And I think we should over overstate. That would be my recommendation. Look at that language even more. Maybe bolles for little bit more. Again, this is all editable. Nothing is set in stone. Yeah, I just wanted to say I appreciate that. Sewer maps. See, one of the things can I bring up when we were on the safety part, Tyler, I look at the fire truck and I look at downtown, and I think about what happened in Ohio, you know, last year, and that derailment in the town. Do we have any special provisions or plans in place as a result of an event like that to protect downtown? We're trying to dial it up so much. Do we have anything in our plan to address something like that? In the plan? In our plan? I don't know if it's in the different plan. That's a different plan, Roy. It's Troy said. Yeah, we do have plans for issues with that. We actually had a rail car last night that had an issue. No threat to public safety. So it wasn't brought up, but we have response plans. Something of that magnitude is hard to pre plan 100%, but we use our EMA and mutual aid agreements, which obviously help with that. So, yeah, just to add to that, Roy, we're on a much higher level, which was one of the plans referenced in that slide shows our Scott county hazard mitigation plan. So we kind of throw all the risks on the table, prioritize them, plan, you know, very high level. And it kind of helps emergency EMA and also local safety departments to kind of focus in on some of these issues. We did. We did an update to you guys on the hazard mitigation plan. You may not remember, but we did that update with you. And that that plan also keeps us eligible for federal funding. Should we have some type of disaster. Good. Thanks. So schools is our point. We're going in north of 80. We really don't have to. Pleasant Valley Bentondorf schools is our school districts that we deal with, but North Scott is going to be a significant portion of north of 80. So we'll have three school, public school districts that we'll be interacting with as we grow. North city staff is session planning that kind of nature and then our sewer, current sewer and proposed sewer. And that's like the protect and maintain, just kind of looking at growth and how our city facilities need to keep up. And then the last chapter or last main chapter is just their implementation and it really just goes over those action items that are within each chapter, kind of sets out maybe an annual action program, basically kind of evaluating. I think there'll just be an update of this table and see it could probably be kind of part of the strategic, before the strategic planning happens or have we done any of these, what items have been addressed or are ongoing? Just an update of the table really. But it goes through those action items, kind of gives a leadership role. PNZ versus council staff. Those can be a lot of overlapping so I wouldn't take them too literal.

And then the partners and then the priorities are just one or two that has been commented on so we can scrub those a little further. But that's all the implementation chapter is about. There's some funding sources which are just a list of really public funding grant sources and the appendix chapter which we covered in our slideshow. But this is that legislative history. So that is the plan. And with that, Taylor, we have. Nice job. There's two minutes for questions. I'm running a tight ship. We can actually control the agenda to set things to. Time to adjourn. We're letting our. So we're taking advantage of it. So I just guess I don't know what's going on when I'm not there in person. There's nobody in the audience. Yeah. Thinking it. I know I admitted it. Okay. Our general timeline. We hope to get any input either tonight or, or reach out individually if anything comes to mind after the meeting or over the weekend or whatever. But we hope to get a draft that can be recommended at our next meeting in May. Right to that. That would be a public hearing and then be recommended to council and they'd have a public hearing just like an ordinance. So that's kind of our aim. So we probably need any substantive comments. But like I'll say like two weeks before that meeting. So just that's what that's our goal. It does. It's not in stone, though. Like Mark mentioned, it's not a real rush. Self imposed. So great with that play to. Plus. Nice job. Nicely done on the presentation, Taylor and Mark, I'm really impressed with this whole. I can't imagine how many hours full, comprehensive plan is just phenomenal. Yes. With that, I'm going to adjourn this meeting.", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"City Facilities\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Plan to protect and maintain city facilities\",\n            \"Strategic planning for growth and development\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n        \"comment\": \"While the transcript mentions positive goals for city facilities, it lacks specific business entities or actionable investment opportunities.\"\n    }\n]", "esg_v1": "[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Municipal Sewer Project\",\n    \"insights\": [\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Discussing the current and proposed sewer systems and their impact on city growth.\",\n        \"classification\": \"E\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Mention of funding sources, which include public funding grant sources.\",\n        \"classification\": \"G\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Implementation involves evaluating action items and assessing what has been addressed or is ongoing.\",\n        \"classification\": \"G\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]", "esg_v2": [{"name": "Municipal Sewer Project", "insights": [{"observation": "Discussing the current and proposed sewer systems and their impact on city growth.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Mention of funding sources, which include public funding grant sources.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Implementation involves evaluating action items and assessing what has been addressed or is ongoing.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 5196492, "chunk_end_time": 5376774, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQRhAFe4Wxw", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQRhAFe4Wxw&t=5196s"}], "date": "17/04/2024", "meeting_name": "Planning and Zoning Commission Meeting"}, {"chunks": [{"start": 0, "end": 5000, "text": "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

Here. Jagger. Here. Naumann. Here. Sexer. Here. Baden. Here. Palczynski. Here. Thank you all for being here. Now, if everyone could please rise, remove any caps or headdresses you may have and join me in the pledge of allegiance. Please stay standing for the invocation which follows the pledge tonight. That will be given by Alan Ross, the executive director of the Jewish foundation, or, excuse me, Federation. Thank you, Alan. Sorry about that. Of the Quad Cities, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Alan, thank you. This is a prayer that we do every week, every Saturday in jewish synagogues throughout the world. It's called the prayer for our country. Let us pray. Our God and God of our ancestors, we ask your blessings for our country, for its government, for its leaders and advisors, and for all who exercise just and rightful authority. Teach them insights from your Torah. They may administer all affairs of state fairly, that peace and security, happiness and prosperity, justice and freedom may forever abide in our midst. Creator of all flesh, bless all the inhabitants of our country with your spirit. The citizens of all races and creeds forge a common bond and true harmony, to banish hatred and bigotry, and to safeguard the ideals and free institutions that are the pride and glory of our country. May this land under your providence be an influence for good throughout the world, uniting all people in peace and freedom, helping them to fulfill the vision of your profit. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation. Neither shall they experience war anymore. Let us say amen. Amen. All right, you may be seated. Thank you, Alan Ross, the executive director of the Jewish Federation of the Quad Cities. Now on to an organization led by a wonderful individual who does a lot of good in our community. Consistent with our prayer, Major Bob Dolliber from the Salvation army is here to present us with a little token of appreciation for some time we spent raising a little money. Thank you for the note. Yeah. Thank you for being here. Good. Yeah. Well, mayor and city council members, today we notified the media that Salvation army of the Quad Cities had reached our $750,000 make a difference campaign goal for Christmas. And that's a lot of coins, a lot of bills and a lot of checks. And more than that, we raised $50,000 more than last year. So we're really happy about that. And all that money stays local, making lives different for the people that we serve, not only at Christmas time, but throughout the year. And I just checked last night. In the Quad cities, 169 individuals, including 107 children, were provided shelter and transitional housing services by the Salvation army. And with that, they received case management help, finding, setting goals, finding jobs, finding stable housing, keeping their kids in school. And, mayor, you and your generous supporters were a big part in making that happen. For the second year, we laid down the challenge of mayoral battle of the bells to the Quad City mayors. And this year we went from three to five mayors, accepted the challenge to see how much money they could raise in just 2 hours. And those five mayors raised $1,000 to help make a difference. And I'm so happy that we're keeping the traveling trophy on this. Supporters raised $459. Yeah, baby. And Lisa won it last year for me when I was out of town, so you can hold on to that. Cool. Thanks to all of you. Gotta get a picture. Wait. Give him back the bell. Give him back the bell. Very good. Thank you. You bet, Bob. Thanks for coming. Thanks to the Salvation army for all the great work you do. Thanks for sharing a little bit about that today. And we'll continue hoping and praying for those that you serve and hoping to provide as much support in time and town as we can to help alleviate the issues that you face every day. All right, we move to a proclamation. And this proclamation is being received. I don't know where this point goes or what it's for by the folks at Unity Point Health. And we're asking that Sean Morrow, the market CEO, come join us. Doctor Oladi, chief medical officer, Unitypoint Health, and Michelle Nearman, the Eastern Division COO, Unitypoint Health. We also have Mary McCumber Schmidt, the president of Unitypoint Health foundation here. We all know Mary. We're glad to see you, Mary. And you certainly can come up and join your group if you wish.

Whereas Unitypoint Health Trinity will celebrate its 20th anniversary at its Fettnerf campus on February 18, 2024. And whereas the hospital opened its doors on February 18, 2004, and has seen an increase in patient services since that time and continues to grow and change according to the community's healthcare needs, and whereas having community partners committed to preventing illness and injury among our residents is vital to the overall health of our community. And whereas Unitypoint health, Trinity employees, employees, excuse me, medical staff, volunteers, hospital and foundation boards have worked tirelessly together and have willingly given their time, expertise and compassion to provide excellence in patient care. Now, therefore, I, Robert Gallagher, the mayor of the City of Metendorf, Iowa, do hereby proclaim Sunday, February 18, 2024, as Trinity Bettendorf Day in the city of Bettendorf. And I call upon all of our citizens of our great city to join me in congratulating Unity Point Trinity on their 20th anniversary and wishing them well on the next 20 years. Hear, hear. They are. Anybody wish to say a few words before we cut a couple of pictures? Sure. All right. You get to hold that. You're gonna speak. Thank you, mister mayor. Absolutely. I'm Sean Morrow. I'm the president for Unity Point Health Trinity. I'm new to the area. I'm a Bettendorf resident. Bought a home here and I think soon a Betendorf rotary. Remember? Didn't we? We got all kinds of opportunities, Ron. Loving being here. It's hard to think back. I would think 20 years ago when there was not a hospital, full service hospital in this community, given all the growth that's happened, the great things that have occurred here, we're honored to be a part of the city of Bettendorf. The growth, the goodness of the people. And as Bettendorf's only full service community hospital, we look forward to being here for years to come and growing with you. Thank you so much. Come on up. You come up and get one all over the foundation. Stack over this way a little bit. We'll get Mary in a bite. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah. You got the swearing in now. Yeah, baby. Yeah, baby. All right, now the moment you've all been waiting for. A packed house, not really for the bell ringing award, right? Just to see that. Okay, ready, sir. You, sir. Yes, sir. Please join me up here. The honor to. Ladies and gentlemen, our fire chief, Chief Troy said. Obviously, we're here to swear in six new officers. So, chief, you have the floor, chief. All right, well, thank you very much, your honor. Appreciate it. Thank you all for coming tonight. It's a huge special night for us here at the city of Bettendorf. We're swearing in six new firefighters. Couldn't be more than happy to have them on our team, and we appreciate everything they do. I'd like to start off by thanking all the family members for the six new guys. You guys are really their support group and they need that. I know the process of becoming a firefighter isn't easy, and then being married to one is even more difficult. I can tell you that much. But they need that support, and I can tell you we're here to support them along their journey as well. We're going to add lib a little bit tonight because you guys may not realize this, but ten minutes before this all happened, we had a structure fire come out. All of our paid guys left. We're still waiting on one of those individuals, but I'm sure he'll show up because they're pretty good at overcoming and adapting. And there he is. We're not putting the fire out. Those two are working, so they have an excuse for being late. Other than that, no excuse. Just teasing. I got to make sure I get their numbers right. They'll be upset with me. Along with thanking all the family members, I appreciate, city staff that's here today, all of our department heads. I'd like thank our community members for being here, county members, partners for being here. I'd like to .1 out in particular, and that's Jean Dixon. I'm going to embarrass her a little bit. She embarrasses me a lot. It seems like she is one of our civil service commissioners, and she volunteers her time along with two other individuals, to come and sit through a very long day of interviews. And then they have a very difficult decision of making that list. And it is hard to do because we get some really qualified applicants, and you're going to see that tonight as we introduce them. So thank you, Jean, for all your volunteer time. We truly appreciate it. And, of course, our elected officials. Mayor Bob, city Administrator Decker plain without your support, it doesn't happen. I mean, it's, it's truly that simple. So representing all the men and women from the fire department, I'd like to say thank you. And I, we truly mean that. So we appreciate all your support. Last thing I want to do is thank my firefighters because they're the ones day in and day out that do the job. They make us look really good.

So let's get to the reason why we're here. Mayor Gallagher is going to do the swearing in of our individuals. I'm going to try not to embarrass them, but as they come up, I'm going to give you a quick snippet of their life. And, I mean, really quick. Doesn't do justice for what these individuals have accomplished. And then we'll take some photos and call the evening. Get you guys out here. And let you go wherever the plans are tonight. We're going to start with Dan Decker. He joined our department in October of 2022. He was extremely busy his first year. He was in the paramedic program when he came to us. And that's very difficult to do. He did outstanding in all of his clinical study time. And then we sent him to the academy in the fall. So that's part of the reason these two first individuals. Are kind of late getting sworn in. They were busy, and that's by design. The busier we keep them, the better off they are. He graduated from the University of Iowa. With a degree in exercise science. He loves golfing, exercising, obviously. And I think the most important thing is that he's a third generation firefighter. And with him tonight is his mom and dad, Tom and Judy Becker. Tom just retired from Davenport, I think, 30 years or plus 30 years. So thank you for your service, sir. And along with him is his girlfriend, Willa. So Tom will come up afterwards and do the pinning. Sir, it's all yours. Come join me over here. How are you? There you go. All right. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Daniel Deckard. I, Daniel Deckard. Do solemnly swear. Do solemnly swear. That I will support the constitution of the United States. Constitution of the United States. And the Constitution of the state of Iowa. And the constitution of the state of Iowa. And that I will faithfully and impartially. I will. Faithfully and impartially. To the best of my ability. To the best of my ability. Discharge all duties as firefighter. Discharge all duties as firefighter. As now or hereafter. As now or hereafter. Required by law. Required by law. Welcome aboard. Exactly. Remember how one of those works, sir? I've never done it from this bad angle. Right. Usually the shirt's on the bed. Oh. A little blood never hurt. Pretty tough. Won't be the first time. I. Cause probably. Tom, we gotta be out here midnight. There you go. All right. Our next individual is John Kosli. He also joined our department in October of 2022. Before that, he was a volunteer with us. So he had some experience coming in. We got to interview him for a long time, which was nice. And he, too, had a very busy year attending academy. Right off the bat from being hired, they kind of switched spaces. One in the spring and one in the fall. John grew up in Omaha, Nebraska. He has a major in finance. He spent ten years in the finance world as a series seven extraordinary. I don't even know what it is. It's something that we're going to definitely use for our advantage. So we're glad to have it here tonight. John is with his wife Dolly and three daughters, and Dolly's going to do the pinning. Daughters are Kendall, Maddie, and Ella. So welcome aboard. Thank you, sir. Ready? Ready. All right. Raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, John Koslik. I, John Koslik. Do solemnly swear. Do solemnly swear that I will support the constitution of the United States that I will support the constitution of the United States and the constitution of the state of Iowa.

So we're going to fast forward a year. It's November of 23 now, and these are our next four hire. Next four hires. Jacob Culver. If you want to come up, he will be going to the fire academy in about how many days? 20 days. So, hired in November and right to a seven week program. It's very, very difficult. But in the meantime, we prep these individuals that are going to academy, so I'm sure he's ready for the job.

Next four hires. Jacob Culver. If you want to come up, he will be going to the fire academy in about how many days? 20 days. So, hired in November and right to a seven week program. It's very, very difficult. But in the meantime, we prep these individuals that are going to academy, so I'm sure he's ready for the job. He grew up in Hampton, Illinois, and volunteered for that program, and he enjoys working out Jack hockey, hanging out with his family, friends, and he's an avid Hawkeye fan. So he's still here. Yep.

Discharge all duties of firefighter discharge all duties of firefighter as now or hereafter. As now or hereafter. Required by law. Required by law. Chief, at some point. Thank you. Thank you. They must be noon. It depends. They're very difficult to open. That's the only thing. They're very stiff. I don't want to embarrass Jake, but he was chief Fenorich's replacement. You don't have big shoes to fill. But chief, this is your new protege. I'm sure he's going to do just fine. Thank you. Very nice. All right, we're going to continue. The next one is Tyler Chia and just council. So, you know, this is the start of our safer grant. The next three are the first three in our safer grant and then we'll have three more coming in a couple months and we can repeat this process, which I'm sure you're happy about. I'm ecstatic. So Tyler Chia also started, like I said, in November. He's going to be heading to academy as well in 20 days. I know he's ready for the challenge. Once again, it's not easy, but these guys are ready for it. He was born in Wisconsin, but I claim him as a Bettendorf kid because he moved here when he was three years old. So that's a win for us. We're still going to say he's a Bettendorf kid. He played a ton of sports through junior high and high school, always competing with his brother Stephen, who was his biggest competitor, and they were inseparable. So Tyler talks about you all the time. Stephen says you're a great mentor even though you're twins, but he also talks about when you guys split from college, and that was hard for him and I think it was hard for you. But the good thing about that story is now they're both back living in Bettendorf, continuing their professional careers. So we're glad to see you back here as well. Joining Tyler tonight are his biggest supporters, Mark and Heidi Chia and Steven's girlfriend, Erin. So welcome aboard. Right hand and repeat after me. I, Tyler Chia. I, Tyler Chia, do solemnly swear. Do solemnly swear. That I will support the constitution of the United States I will support the constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state of Iowa. And the constitution of the state of Iowa.

Discharge all duties as firefighter. As now or hereafter. As of now or hereafter. Required by law. Required by law. Congratulations. Thanks for being here. Can't tell they're twins, huh? He also says he's more athletic. I'll let you guys battle that out this evening. All right, our next one to come swearing in is Joseph Martinez. Come up. Come on up. Joe also hired in November. He was also a volunteer force prior to, and we got to spend a ton of quality time from him. And the guys just spoke volumes about him when they were working on his station. Four with him totally impressed our staff, and honestly, that's part of the interview process, so congratulations on that. As you can tell, he's just a well, clean cut kid. He is currently enrolled in the paramedic program, which he's doing extremely well in, but it is so time consuming. With all the clinical hours, the right time you have to do, and obviously studying. We're going to delay sending him to fire academy in 20 days for good reason. We want him to finish that program, and then he's going to continue fire academy in the fall with some more of our new hires coming, so he has a little bit of advantage. Maybe. Maybe you can get the insight from those guys attending. Joe was born and raised in Danport, worked for medic, obviously before here, too. And tonight, supporting him are his parents, Joe and Nicole Martinez, his younger brother and sister, and Joe's grandfather and his mother, Nicole will be doing the tennis. Congratulations. Raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Joseph Martinez. I, Joseph Martinez, do solemnly swear. Do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States.

Required by law. And the last one this evening, Dalton south one up. Dalton. He was hired in November of 23 with the group. He also worked for medic EMS prior to employment here with us. And he is also leaving in 20 days for basic fire Academy, which I'm sure they're all thrilled about, actually. It's a great program. It's one of the best programs you can send new hires to.

Welcome to the plan and zone commission meeting of March 20. Can we have the roll call, please? Gibson. Kapler. Here. Kulkarni. Here. Ormsby. Here. Satterfield. Here. Stoltenberg. Here. Wendlands. Here. All right, do we have an approval of the minutes of the February 21 meeting? Mister chairman, I'll move for approval of the minutes from the February 21 meeting. I submitted second. All right, we have a first and second. All those in favor say aye. Aye. All right, motion passes. All right. This is the plan and zone commission, a seven member commission appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council. The commission is a recommending body only, with the city council making the final decision. Our regular meetings are held on Wednesday, the third Wednesday of the month at 530 right here. Occasionally we have some special meetings. We cover rezoning requests, preliminary plats, site development and landscape plans, and planned unit developments. All right. With that, we will dive right in. Taylor. Thank you, chairman. As mentioned for the record, the case 20 419 has been deferred to the next regular scheduled meeting, April. Next case on agenda is 20 418, site development plan for 3636 Tanglewood Road. This is the location of the Tangled Wood restaurant. The applicant is Craig Wegener, owner. The request is for site development plan proposes 18 hole mini golf course with associated lighting, landscaping and artificial turf. At the last or this month. This month's board of adjustment meeting, a special use permit was approved by the Board of Adjustment. This was required due to the use in a c one district. Case 20 417. And for those who don't know, the Tanglewood's on Devil's Glen Road and Tanglewood Road on the east side of Delves Glen Road. Future land use and zoning the currently adopted future land use map designates this area as urban low intensity, surrounded by public, semi public. We have the pv bus barn to the north, public works and park maintenance to the northeast. And then across the street we have some urban medium intensity, our townhomes due south and then the YMCA and some medical clinics. Current zoning is c one industrial to the north and then other c one across the street to the south and then to the west of Devil's Glen we have residential plan unit development. Just wanted to peek at our draft future land use map. So this is where what we'll be adopting with the new updated comp plan. This area has been designated as community commercials, so it's a little higher intensity. This is. Changes were proposed due to the trend in development along the Devil's Glen corridor. We're seeing a lot of commercial development, especially on the east side of Devil's Glen. This restaurant is one of them. And then we have other developments further south south of town Tanglefoot and then some medium intensity mixed use with the townhomes to the south. So those are staying the same. This is the draft right now though. So the existing site, the existing outdoor uses the Tanglewood include a bar, patio, evening music events, yard games and the fire pits as well. A meadow exists east of this of these establishments or amenities and this is where the proposed miniature golf course is proposed. The city of Bettendorf owned property farther east contains a parking lot which is leased by the restaurant. Staff is recommending the site development plan be amended to show the golf course only on the restaurant property. The lease agreement is just for parking. So would you like to see the all the golf course construction be completely on the Tanglewood property? Take a look at the current existing site and their parking allotments. As mentioned, the city of Betten Darfo and parking lot contains 52 spaces so that's shown right here. The parking on the Tanglewood property is 145 spaces and then the owner of the Tanglewood has an agreement with the YMCA shared parking agreement for their 277 spaces. So you have over, I think 372 spaces. The parking requirement for all these uses mentioned and the proposed use would be 372. They have 474 bespoke so they have 474 spaces requirement high code is 372. The golf course would require 18 more spaces, one for each hole. So it kind of gives you an overview of the parking the proposed plan. As mentioned, the meadow exists where the proposed golf cart course is being proposed. A fence is proposed on this miniature golf course to surround it. Currently a fence bisects where the golf course is proposed so that will have to be amended. It's not shown the site plan so staff is verbally recommending that be added that the fence be added to the site plan as well. Movement of that golf course on the property is another recommendation. Staff will note the overall increase in customers intensity is small relative to the over twelve or 1250 person occupancy that exists on the site. So they have done a life safety plan for indoor and outdoor uses.

At the building permit stage a rendering of the golf course. This is more of a the concept is less of a mini golf course with the windmills and other amenities, more of a putting green style golf course. Noise from the miniature golf course is expected to be limited. Especially true given the existing uses on the property. The vans outdoor patio there is lighting proposed. These are three foot lighting posts shown kind of light green on the rendering. These will illuminate downward onto the course after dark, so just enough to be used after dark. Additional landscaping is proposed, but it will need to be compliant with an overhead power line easement that exists. So a large power line does go over this site. So tall trees would not be allowed due to that easement. But some shrubs there does exist some screening already near the parking lot and the proposed golf course. All stormwater drainage calculations for the development have been reviewed and deemed compliant by engineering staff. So this will be drained. This is all impervious and that will be drained to the east. Staff contends the proposed development meets site development plan standards and code requirements, and staff is recommending approval of case 20 418. Site developed plan for 36 36 Tanglewood Road with the following conditions. Show the mini golf course completely on the Tanglewood restaurant property. And then verbally adding a second condition of showing that fence, the proposed fence on the site plane for the property. Take any questions? Okay. Anyone have any questions? I do have one question, Taylor. I've seen a sign, a small sign, when entering from a devil's Glen road in that. The primary entrance off of Devil's Glen just to the left on the left side of that drive. A very small sign that says additional parking available. And it points to the north. Yeah. Where is that? Can you show me on the aerial? Where is that? Sending customers? So you're talking right here? No, I'm talking the other corner. The other corner over here. No, no. On the entrance. I can ask the question, Taylor. Okay, so we. We allow city lots to be used by joining businesses. So, like the down this. This parking lot in downtown Battenorf in the evening, businesses are welcome to use it if they're having events at Harley Corrine's or what was fumbles. What? Bullock arms. Now, so that lot, that sign that you saw, they had an event planned that weekend, and we allowed them to park at the public works building and walk down. I think it's been. They asked permission to do it, but it's been last summer since they did that. Okay. Yeah, it is a long time. So that's just for a special occasion. That was a special event parking situation that they came to us and asked for. But they are parked appropriately now. And maybe I can just. If I can keep going for a second here, I can just add a little bit more information. So they're parked appropriately now, with their parking on site, the leased parking and the parking agreement, or leased parking. YMCA. So they were instructed, or they were informed very clearly at the board of adjustment that your use is contingent on being able to provide parking. So should they ever lose those two leased parking, they'll have to modify their use to meet the parking that they have. Okay. And they're aware of that. And that's the, you know, that's the risk they take in business. So if one of their partners in this parking arrangement, the city or the YMCA, someday should change the terms of that agreement, or that agreement should end, then their use would have to modify to meet their parking that's available. How do you memorialize that? It was memorialized at the board of adjustment as part of their decision. Okay. This meeting we could also part of the record, if you will. But it would be the same for any business. If any business decided to tear out 20 parking spots, well, then they'd have to modify the use of that business to accommodate. Accommodate that code requirement. Thank you. And then I. And then just one other thing. I think Roy will probably mention it. We would ask that the fence portions that are facing the right of way, or highly visible from the right of way, be more of architectural nature. You know, if you want to put chain link on the back or something, fine, but we would. Knowing. Knowing Mister Wagner, he's probably already planning that. He keeps a pretty nice facility. But we would expect that that would be more of an architectural type fence that's in the public facing portion of this development. And if they do chain link or something that might be in the back. I believe it's the intent of the applicant. They do have fencing all along. I think it goes right here, right now. So it's just removing that north south and extending it farther east and then running it a new section on the property line.

Is it black architectural, Taylor? It's black architectural. Yeah, I can see it. It's weird that I go there enough and I don't know what it looks like. It's. It's not wrought iron, it's conspicuous. Yeah. Speaking of going there and not noticing things, I don't recall seeing any signs helping people know that they can go over to the Guaida park. Have I missed them? People seem to know because there's a lot of cars there, but that's a very good point. Yeah, we could work with them on some directional wayfinding signage. That'd be a phone call. That we could probably do separate from this meeting, just that we think that's probably necessary and not a big deal. It's happening. I don't know if they're doing it through their Facebook page or other ways of communicating, but it is happening. Sure. And I don't like to put signs everywhere, but in some cases it. It might help. They have a nice new digital message board that might be a place to contact. And I'm not sure that it doesn't exist as I'm hedging a little bit because I'm not sure that it doesn't exist. And we've done similar parking instructions. An example would be shops of the woodlands. They have some off site parking at the summit, and there's a sidewalk with additional parking signs. So very similar and directional signage isn't permitted. It's not. Doesn't go against your sign. Allow. It's for permits. Okay, I have a question. So this, this whole golf, mini golf course is probably going to be putting, you know, putting style and mostly artificial turf. So it does. How is the stormwater kind of managed? Is that being addressed? I can answer that. I did not include the drainage plan on this, but they have basically piping. This is all artificial turf, actually. It's 100%. Even the blue is artificial and the sand is artificial. And so they have it all piped to go east into that pretty much meadow area. It doesn't, as I said, the engineering department review doesn't meet the requirements for detaining it. And we may have somebody from the design company here as well. If there's questions like that they might be able to help answer. Okay. Any other questions? Anyone in the audience you wish to ask a question? Okay. Would you like a motion? Let's go for it. Mister chairman, I'll move for approval of case number 240, one eight, subject to staff recommendations. I will second that. And that will include the one that's not listed but the one tailored the fence, correct? Okay with that, all those in favor say aye. Opposed? Same sign. Motion carries. I'll present on the next two cases 24 21 and 24 22. This is a preliminary plat and final plat for the reserve. This is a. An extraterritorial review. Little background. The applicant is reed Windmiller. The request is for an extraterritorial review of the final plat. The plat proposes a 15 lot single family residential development located east of Wells Ferry Road. There's twelve developable lots in the subdivision proposed. This, as shown, is east of Wells Ferry Road. So it's well outside our city limit, current city limits, but it is within our extra territorial review area. We have an agreement with Leclair, which a boundary line is roughly the western edge of the golf course. So falls in east or west that line. We have by state power to review plats within that area and that goes all around the city to the northwest. Future land use and zoning the plat area is zoned r1 single family within unincorporated Scott county under their zoning map. So it is current residential, our future land use and our annexation, our draft annexation map, it's outside that annexation map. Everything west of there that's not developed is shown under proposed annexation map. But this is. This area has not contemplated for annexation on that map at this time. And this will be shown in our comp plan update which will be coming for you soon. Looking at the preliminary plat, the plat proposes a total of 15 lots. Twelve developable access is provided via tall Pine lane and Sawgrass Court from Wells Ferry road improvements are designed to meet button door standard specifications. They are shown 53 foot right away sidewalks, though they will be privately owned and maintained. The county will not be plowing these or maintaining these. Each available lot will be served by individual septic systems, not on a leclair or Bettendorf sewer. Also, Bettendorf fire is designated as backup for this development. This development will be extending water mains south, I believe, along Wells Ferry Road, so they will have fire hydrants in the subdivision. The fire department has reviewed this and their specifications. The proposed final plat matches the preliminary platform exactly because it lies without outside the feature annexation area for the city. Because the preliminary plat meets all the requirements of the city, staff is recommending concurrent approval of the preliminary plat and final plat.

Any questions from the commission? Mister Chairman, I would just note that I was talking to chief Sade prior to our meeting today. We're actually the primary fire service. We're not back up. We have. Chief can explain better than I do, but we have certain designated areas surrounding the city where we are the actual primary provider and this would be a primary service for us. So I would. I would correct the report to note that. Thank you. That is correct. Thank you. Okay, Roy, do you have any questions? No, I look, that was. I addressed those earlier with Mark. I had some questions and called about that. So those were the two things I addressed. So we're good. Is there anyone in the audience that wishes to address this? No. Okay. In that case, I think we need a motion. Mister Chairman, I moved to approve case 240. Two, one and case 24 00:22 subject to staff, both. We'll take them one at a time. So we have a motion for the first 1, second and second. All right, we have a motion in a second. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Aye. Oh, same sign. Okay, case 240, two. One carries. And we already have a motion for the next one. So do we have a second? 2nd. All right, all those in favor say aye. Opposed? Same sign. I think that carries. So I think that's everything. And we're up. Commission updates. Yeah. Mark your calendars, if you haven't already, please. April 3, we'll have a special meeting to go over the comprehensive plan. And we'll also kind of kick off in earnest our efforts on the zoning ordinance update, which is done post comp plan, traditionally. So comp plan is just about done. It's a really good looking document. Thank you for all your efforts. We're just really now going through a formal review and approval process to make that official land use plan of the city. And then we will be asking for some input on the zoning ordinance. I would ask. I don't want to plant anything in your mind, but I would ask that maybe you do a little homework and think about as you encounter the zoning ordinance from your perspective. What has bothered you? What has confused you? What have you not liked? I would not even say, go read it. I would just let you just say, as you've encountered it from your perspective, where have you had hiccups, had questions, thought it was cumbersome, thought it was good, perhaps, because we will edit that in relation to the changes we made to the comp plan. And we really need your input. So what time is that on? The third. Can you remind me? We'll do at the same time, but we're going to move locations just to make it really confusing. So we're going to change locations on you, and we're going to go over to surry Heights, I believe, fire station. Yeah, we'll probably set it up classroom style. Public is welcome.

Sexer. Here. Baden. Here. Belchinsky. All right. I don't see him joining us. Thank you all for being here. Now, if you could all please rise, remove any caps or headdresses you may have and join us in the pledge of Allegiance, which will be followed by an invocation given by Pastor Richard Pecora. Excuse me. Of all Saints Lutheran Church. Please remain standing for the invocation. I pledge allegiance to the fire of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Before I begin, I've been asked to tell you that shin sheets, the wife of Firefighter Tom Sheetz has passed away after an illness, I believe, and there will be a memorial service for her on Friday. And so, as we pray, let's include the sheets family in our thoughts and prayers. Amen. Dear Lord and heavenly father, one day to the next. We hardly know what to predict. Even during one day like today, we don't know if it's rain or if it's snow or what. And we just can't predict things. But we have to anticipate things, and that's the job of our city government. And so we ask you, good lord and heavenly father, to help us anticipate the needs of our community, whether great or small, so that the people of our town are well served and that their health and happiness are there and taken care of. These things, we pray in your name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you, pastor. Might we all just pause and reflect for a minute on Tom and his family, as they will undoubtedly have pain and sorrow and the loss of Jen, great mother, great friend, great spouse. A moment of silence. Thank you. Let's move to public requests of counsel. If there's anyone here who wishes to be heard on an item not already on tonight's agenda for a public hearing, you may be heard by the podium in the back. Please state your name and address. We'd like to hear from you. I recognize everybody here and I don't think anybody is here for public requests. So let's close public requests of counsel. Let's move to our proclamations. We have three today, and we'll start with J A Day. This has been requested by the president and CEO of junior achievement of the heartland. Dougal Nelson. Dougal, come on up. Hello, friend. Hello, mayor. Great seat. Thank you being here. Thank you for having me. Oh, you bet. Always a pleasure. Okay, I have a proclamation from the office of the mayor. Whereas, the city of Bettendorf will observe Ja Day on April 4, 2024, as an opportunity to recognize and celebrate junior achievement of the heartland for empowering our young people to own their economic success. And whereas, junior achievement of the heartland's educational contribution equips our young people to become the next generation of productive employees and self sufficient citizens to ensure the economic prosperity of Bettdorf and the region. And whereas, it is fitting for parents, educators, businesses and other members of the community to join in junior achievements effort to ensure the future success and economic health of our young people and the communities in which they live. Now, therefore, I, Robert Gallagher, the mayor of the city of Betendor, do hereby proclaim April 4, 2024, as Ja day in the city of Bettendorf. Thank you, sir. You bet. You bet. Tell us about Ja or anything else you want to say. Yeah, for public speaking. Because he tell he could say the words better than anyone can. But anyway, really what we do is prepare and inspire young people for success in a global economy. We want them to have the skill sets and the mindsets to build thriving communities like Bettendorf. I appreciate you, Merritt. You're in the classroom volunteering as well as some others in the room. I really appreciate that. There's some big things happening in Bettendorf this year. We've piloted a new program called J Inspire Career Expo. I'm proud to tell you that every 8th grader attended that career expo from Bettendorf middle schools. It was a wonderful event. Over 55 vendors. The kids got to explore jobs and careers they didn't even know existed. The other thing that the students got involved in this year for the first time was the stock market challenge. Great event. Kids learned how the stock market worked and afterwards the adults got invited to see how the market worked as well. I'll tell you, the students outperformed the adults. Probably the best news I have today is we are going to launch some programs in the Bettendorf parks and rec summer programs. This year we've got three programs going. They're all about financial literacy. One of the programs is for the middle school students, one of the programs is for the high school students, and the third one is for the 18 to 24 year old group.

And anyway, thank you to the council and the mayor and the citizens of Bettendorf for everything you do and for volunteering in the classroom and really making a difference in a young person's life. I appreciate that. I got an opportunity today to talk to all the fifth graders at Mark Twain who are getting ready to go to Biztown. Asked how many thought they might be running for merit was over half the class. Apparently. We are going to be okay. In the future, there will be people running for public office. No more years. No more years. Yeah. I met a young girl over the weekend and she goes to Mark Twain and she told me she was going to Bistown. She said, can you do anything about getting me the mayor's job? Yes, she's asking the right. I told them how to run a campaign today, but they all got the same advice. Thank you, everyone. Have a great night. Our next proclamation is national Public Safety Telecommunicators Week, which is April 14 through the 20th. And this proclamation is requested by our Scott Emergency Communications center, or SEC, as we call it. Our deputy deputy director, Tracy Screechfield, is here, as are Ashley Huffman, Matthew Swain, and Todd Malone. Come on up. Appreciate you all being here and thank you for the great work that you do. All right, I do have a proclamation from the office of the mayor. Whereas emergencies occur around the clock and every day that require response from public safety resources, and wHereas, the properly processing of emergency calls and determining the correct response resources is critical to the protection of life and preservation of property and wHereas, the safety of our public safety professionals depends upon information obtained from those who dial 911 and reach the Scott Emergency Communications center and wHEREAs, public safety dispatchers are the first and most critical contact our citizens have with emergency services and wHeReas, public safety dispatchers are an essential safety line for our responders by monitoring their activities by radio, providing them information and ensuring their safety and wHereas, public safety dispatchers of the Scott Emergency Communications center contribute substantially to the successful outcomes for law enforcement and medical responses, and whereas, the past year has continued to be to present unprecedented challenges for public safety dispatchers of SECC, and those challenges were met with professionalism, patience, compassion, and unending resolve. Now, therefore, I, Robert Gallagher, the mayor of the City of Bettany, to hereby proclaim April 14 through the 20th, 2024, as national public safety telecommunicators win in the city of Bettendorf in our community. And I encourage all of our citizens to honor those whose diligence and professionalism keep us and our city safe. Hear, hear. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you very much for the hard work that you all perform. I get to see a couple of you once a month or so, and we appreciate that opportunity, but we don't get to say thank you to the frontline people all the time. You're the ones doing the hard work, and we know that. Thank you. Tracy, would you like to say, I just want to thank you. Thank you to the council for recognizing my staff for doing this. I'm here just to accept this in case nobody came up here with me. They're the true heroes behind the scene. They take this job because they do want to stay behind the scene, but they truly are an amazing group to work with. I wouldn't have the position that I have without them. They are the ones that get all the gratitude they need to get the gratitude, the stress that they encounter every single day. It is. It's something that your family and your loved ones that they wouldn't even be able to comprehend. We bring firefighters into the dispatch center. We bring cops into the dispatch center, and they don't understand. It's something that you try to kind of picture in your head. Well, this is probably what it looks like. This is what they do every day. Every single first responder that we have brought into the center, and they leave. Every single one has told me, this is not at all what I had pictured. This is not at all what I had thought. And this is not a job that I could do. So while they are running into gunfire, into fires, nothing I could ever do, that's for darn sure. What they see is not at all what they had pictured and the multitasking that they are doing and answering multiple calls and the calls that they are hearing on a daily basis, it's truly outstanding of the work that they do, and they do it with grace, and you wouldn't know the stress that they are under. You wouldn't know that the tasks that we are throwing at them every day, and nobody likes change.

We bring cops into the dispatch center, and they don't understand. It's something that you try to kind of picture in your head. Well, this is probably what it looks like. This is what they do every day. Every single first responder that we have brought into the center, and they leave. Every single one has told me, this is not at all what I had pictured. This is not at all what I had thought. And this is not a job that I could do. So while they are running into gunfire, into fires, nothing I could ever do, that's for darn sure. What they see is not at all what they had pictured and the multitasking that they are doing and answering multiple calls and the calls that they are hearing on a daily basis, it's truly outstanding of the work that they do, and they do it with grace, and you wouldn't know the stress that they are under. You wouldn't know that the tasks that we are throwing at them every day, and nobody likes change. They'll be the first ones to tell you that. But they take it with grace and they do a great job with it. And I'm very appreciative of them. I wish we could give them more than one week a year, but we're happy to do it. We try to give them some good weeks for it. So we're planning that on Thursday. So, yeah, lots of fun stuff. We're very excited about it. And thank you, guys. For everything that you do and for coming up here today. Thank you. Thank you. All right, again, dear. Thank you. You bet. Thank you. Lastly, National Work Zone Awareness Week is April 15 through the 19th, and this proclamation was requested by the Iowa and Illinois departments of Transportation, the cities of Bettendorf and Moline. And for this, we welcome our public works director, Mister Brian Schmidt, to the front of the room. Sir. Thank you, your honor. Thanks for being here. All right, I do have a proclamation from the office of the mayor. Whereas highway and street construction work, as well as repairs to roadways, are often completed while roadways are open to traffic, putting both motorists and workers at risk every day. And whereas, public works, law enforcement, firefighters, emTs, and other emergency personnel also put themselves in harm's way on the roads each and every day performing their duties, and whereas, workers diligently continue to improve, rebuild, maintain roadways so that motorists can safely and effectively travel, and whereas accidents can be prevented by setting aside distractions, using extra caution, reducing speed, and giving work zones your undivided attention while traveling through. Now, therefore, I, Robert Gallagher, the mayor of the city of Ed, north Iowa, do hereby proclaim April 15 through the 19th as national work Zone awareness Week. And I encourage all motorists to be extra vigilant on the roadways, whether in a work zone, passing police, fire, rescue, towing, or other personnel. Here, here, your honor. Thank you, your honor. You're welcome. You have the floor. Well, whispering right around the corner, many state, local, and even our city employees around both Illinois and iowa will be setting up traffic control to repair roads, as well as police and fire attending to vehicles or somebody on the side of the road, anywhere within the right of way. It's always important not to only recognize just one week, but a year round effort for everybody to be aware of their surroundings, to slow down, be cautious, be aware of their surroundings, not only for their safety, but for those who are working within the right of way. So I appreciate the proclamation, and hopefully everybody spreads the word as the construction season begins. Perfect. Thank you, Angie. Thanks, Brian. All right, lots of proclamations today. Plethora. Plethora. A few, at least. So we move to our first item on the agenda for real work. This is a public hearing on the Criswell street rehabilitation project. Ryan Schmidt, director of public works. Couple sentences about this. I think we're all aware of this one coming and what our rehabilitation project budget is. Thank you, your honor. This is an important project for the east side of the city that has seen significant growth between Forest Grove and Valley Drive. On Criswell. So this project involves a full depth of reclamation. That's where we go in there and churn up all, all the existing base, add cement and water to it, stabilize it, and then we're going to be putting a five inch layer of asphalt on top of it, very similar to what we did on Forest Grove Drive between middle road and Criswell. We're going to restripe it as well. So it'll definitely increase safety through this corridor as we start seeing significant growth up through that area, will the road be any wider? It will be slightly wider, yes, sir. Cause the drop off points are starting to. So one of the things too, that after they stabilize the base, they'll reprofile the cross section, because right now it's a pretty steep cross section. So they'll reprofile that to about a 2% grade, and then it'll be slightly wider than what it does. It exists today. Thanks, sir. Questions for brian. Okay, michelle, did we publish notice of this public hearing? Yes, we did, your honor. And I do have affidavit of publication. Did we receive any written correspondence with regards to. No, we did not. All right, let's open the Criswell street rehab project. Anybody here wish to be heard on this item? All right, we'll close that move to the resolution. Councilmember Brown, please. Thank you, your honor. I have a resolution approving the plan, specifications and form of contract for the Criswell street rehabilitation project from Forest Grove Drive to Valley Drive. I move approval of this resolution second any discussion. Michelle, please call the roll. Adamson? Aye. Brown? Jagger? Aye. Naumann? Aye. Sexer? Aye. Aye.

Yeah, thanks. Your honor, this is required variance language that needs to be in our ordinance regarding floodplain. We had a state model ordinance that we adopted. DNR provided that model ordinance language. They left out the variance language that needed to be in there and they've provided that to us. So we're just amending that in. And we do also remind you that we would like just one reading if that would be acceptable to this body. Thank you, sir. Any questions for mark before we go through the public hearing? All right, Michelle, do we publish notice of this public hearing? Yes, we did, your honor. And I do have affidavit of publication. Did we receive any written correspondence with regard to the same. No, we did not. All right, let's open the public hearing with regard to those changes Mister Hunt outlined for us. Anybody here wish to be heard on this item? All right, let's close the public hearing. And we have been asked to waive the second and third readings for good cause, to try to get this done before on April 11, printing of some documents. I'd like to entertain a motion to waive the second and third readings at this time. So move second. All right, Michelle, on waiving the second and third readings, could you please call the roll? Adamson? Aye. Brown? Aye. Jagger? Aye. Naumann? Aye. Sexer? Aye. Baden? Aye. Thank you, council member Adamson. This will be the first and final reading. May you please, or can you please help us? Thank you.
