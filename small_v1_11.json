First of all, I'd like to introduce our city attorney, David Lovell. David, please explain the role of the public comment. Thank you, mister chair. Members of the subcommittee. During citizen comment, members of the public may address the subcommittee for up to three minutes on issues of interest or concern to them. The Arizona Open meeting law permits the subcommittee members to listen to the comments, but prohibits members from discussing or acting on the matters presented. Members of the public may speak for up to two minutes to comment on agenda items to be discussed. Comments must be related to the item and in the action being considered by the subcommittee. The subcommittee and staff cannot discuss or comment on matters related to pending investigations, claims, or litigation. Additionally, any member of the public who appears before the subcommittee in their capacity as a lobbyist must, as required by Phoenix City code, disclose this fact before addressing the subcommittee. The code requires speakers to present their comments in a respectful and courteous manner. Profane language, threats, our personal attacks on members of the public, council members, our staff, are not allowed. A person who violates these rules will lose their opportunity to continue to speak. Thank you. Thank you very much. I would also like to introduce our interpreter, Carmen Cotta, who will provide a brief announcement. Thank you, Mister chair. This is Carmen Cota. Give me a minute to introduce myself to our spanish speaking audience. Buenos dias. Interpret esta manana sida san escuchala reunion CPN. Sandar sukumentario avlen poucen ide me la portonidade interpretales ela forma mass correcta posible. Gracias. Thank you, mister chair. Thank you, Carmen. Okay, before we actually get started, I want to take this opportunity to introduce our newest peer, council member, Carlos Galindo Alvaro, to this subcommittee. So, Carlos, welcome. Thank you, mister chairman. And I also want to take this opportunity to recognize a group that's in the audience today, the Young Southeast Asian Leaders association leaders program out of Arizona State University through the US Department of Justice. You guys welcome. We'll get an opportunity to talk to you right afterwards. And Hector, thank you for bringing them along. Really appreciate it. So with that, thank you very much. Okay. Yes. With that, item number one is approval of the economic development and Housing subcommittee. Minutes from March 20, 2024. Do I have a motion? I have a motion. Is there a second motion? And second. All those in favor say aye. Chair votes aye. Motion carries. Thank you very much for that. Next, we move to our consent agenda. Items two through four. And we actually have a registered speaker for item number two. But before we get to that, would any of my colleagues like a presentation first from staff or hear from the speaker? Okay. And I know as for the speaker, Nicole Rodriguez, you only wanted to speak if necessary. Is that still, still the case? If you're present? I would like to speak regardless. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Go ahead, Nicole. Okay, so I was hoping to provide comment after the presentation just to have better context. But the main intent for this is that one of the items of issue with the upcoming presentation is that we still do not have a platform for reporting any kind of damaged trees, removed trees, dying or decayed trees from commercial properties. And if you will recall, back in 2021, planning and development issued a text amendment called the Landscaping Text amendment. And in that text amendment that was adopted by council was NSD was charged with actually taking in complaints or reports, I should say, from citizens, residents and businesses regarding any commercial property, including like multifamily and apartments as well, where a property does not comply with the landscape plans that they had submitted to the city prior to their certificate of occupancy. So with that ordinance that was implemented, I also remind folks to councilman Sal decio was opposed to it because he didn't believe that NSD would put forth the effort to make it accessible and easy for people to understand they could do this report, and it still is not the case. So we need a platform to make it easier for folks to understand that they can report any issues for commercial properties that are not in compliance with their landscape plans. And it's pretty easy to see when a large tree is missing and not replaced for many, many years or it's dead and dying in decay. So I just wanted to urge folks here to look into this and for MSD to really make that platform available. It's not discernible via blight. And I serve as a vice chair on Encanto VPC. No one on Encanto seemed to be aware that they could do this as well. We're pretty engaged folks.

Should. Who from staff is here? Is it Spencer, mister chair, Spencer south neighborhood services director is here. Thank you, Spencer. I just wanted to give you an opportunity to respond to the caller's questions and comments about the ability to report commercial property that is not in compliance, mister chair. Councilwoman Hodge, Washington absolutely. And the speaker brought up a great point and something that we have been discussing quite a bit, especially lately, as our office of heat response and mitigation is looking at updating the city's tree and shade master plan. And so one of the things, a couple things that I want to clarify. This item today is about an update to our code enforcement policy, which is not the actual city code. It is simply a guide for how we enforce our city code. There are some changes that went into effect, as Nicole mentioned, related to how we are able to enforce related to trees that have been removed for commercial properties. One of the things that we've found since that code was implemented is it applies when we have a site plan that is specific to the requirements related to trees and that has the appropriate language in order to be able to enforce. So one of the things that we're looking at in coordination with our Office of Heat Response and Mitigation and our planning and development is looking at what properties we have appropriate site plans for right now. Any resident can make a complaint by calling us at 602-5344 emailing us at blightenix dot gov or submitting a request through my Phoenix 311 through our other property complaints section. And we will do that investigation and we'll find out if there's an appropriate site plan on file and we will go out and do the investigation. If trees have been removed that are required. However, it is tricky because there are very few site plans that actually meet those requirements. So for the most part, when we have gone to enforce that particular section, we often don't have the teeth to be able to enforce. So we're working together to look at possible mechanisms to help ensure, improve our ability to enforce and for the community to identify when there is a potential violation and staff as well. Sorry, I know that was kind of lengthy in terms of the explanation, but it is sort of a loaded topic. No, it was perfect. It gave an explanation to the caller's concern. So I thank you for taking. That's it. Chair. Okay. Spencer, Anna, Maria, thank you very much. Are there any questions for our staff on items three or four? Okay, then do I have a motion on items two through four? So move. I have a motion on a second. All those in favor say aye. Chair votes aye. Motion carries. Thank you very much for that. We'll move on to items five through seven are for information only. Do any of my colleagues have any questions or comments? Council vice Mayor Stark, thank you. On item seven. Spencer, I know that you're trying to align the neighborhood specialist with council districts. However, for example, I had two that kind of overlapped in the district, and one of them was working on a business corridor. And I have gotten a request they'd like to keep her. Are there ways that we can kind of work through that with you, mister chair? Vice mayor? Absolutely. You know, whenever we make changes to our assignments, when it comes to neighborhood specialists, it's a tricky thing because we have long established relationships with those neighborhood specialists and we don't like to make changes quickly and we want to make sure there's a process to help do a warm handoff. However, there are some areas, even with these changes that we're implementing, where we will have some folks who stay on because there are particular initiatives or things that we're working on. So. Absolutely. Okay. The only reason I ask is they love her. And I mean, I know you're trying to transition and make things work, and so if there's a transition period, that's fine. I just want to make sure I can tell the group that they can keep her for a while at least. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, mister chair. Spencer, two things stand out for me. Specifically, the chart on page seven, in terms of overdoses by housing status, where the vast majority actually happen in housed environment as opposed to the unhoused. And then the other one was during my briefing where fentanyl is the most talked about opioid overdose. But yet meth is not far behind and can be almost as toxic. When you consider the consideration of the heat and the depression of thirst and hunger by method, what type of follow up will there be on that, and when do we expect the next report?

Mister chair and councilman, I will defer to our office of Public Health related to that particular question. Actually, I got to apologize. I think what we did is we skipped to another item for your question. Okay, so. But we can get it answered now. Throw this out. Yes, chair members of the subcommittee. Thank you, Council Mengelendo Olivia, for bringing that to light. As we discussed in your briefing, you are correct to mention that, in fact, stimulants such as methamphetamine are occurring at a much higher rate for fatal overdoses here in our city. We've referred to information like our data that we'll be speaking to shortly to ensure that we are referring to data and having an evidence based approach to our heat relief efforts this summer. Thank you. Thank you very much, Miss Soto. I think you'll probably get to stay for a few minutes. Okay. We'll move on to item number eight, which is an update on the city substance abuse overdose dashboard. So, Miss Soto, I think you're staying. Is Miss Witt also present? No, I will be presenting today. The whole thing. Okay. Good morning. Chair and members of the subcommittee, I am pleased to join you this morning to launch the Phoenix substance use and overdose dashboard to begin between 2019 and 2021, the rate of fatal overdose in Phoenix increased 39%. In 2021, the city of Phoenix signed on to the one Arizona agreement, which sets out the framework for spending settlement dollars and includes recommendations for approved expenses. Last month, we joined a subcommittee to review the results of various assessments completed in 2023 to identify priorities for funding of which local data and surveillance was identified. And today we are here to launch the Phoenix substance use and overdose dashboard and making local data available. Suspected overdoses are determined based on fire EMS responses. Suspected opioid overdoses are determined by symptomology, where overdose symptoms are noted and where naloxone was administered by EMS. This phenic substance use and overdose dashboard is an opportunity for collective partnership between public health and public safety as well, and our dashboard communicates suspected overdose, fatal overdoses and naloxone information. Suspected overdoses are determined based on fire EMS responses and are determined by symptomology where overdose symptoms are noted and where naloxone was administered by EMS and the patient showed signs of improvement or response. Data is based on information reported in the Phoenix Fire EMS electronic patient care record and is updated monthly. It should be noted that this data is likely an undercount as they are not confirmed cases. This data is updated monthly. Fatal overdose data comes from the Maricopa County Office of the Medical examiner and is based on cause of death. Toxic the Maricopa County Department of Public Health reviews and cleans the data and provides drug related death data for phoenix to the Office of Public Health. Fatal overdoses include all drug related deaths and each fatal overdose often involves more than one drug. This data will be updated annually for the most recent year available and in this case it's 2022. Naloxone information is reported by the Office of Public Health. It is updated monthly and includes the total number of naloxone kits distributed to community through the city's naloxone program. In addition, naloxone administration prior to EMS arrival as reported in Phoenix Fire EPCR, is included on the dashboard. Next, we will view a series of slides highlighting some main data graphs as they will appear on the dashboard. We visually communicate and share this data with respect and compassion acknowledging that the information shared and communicated represents loved ones, family members and friends of our Phoenix community who are impacted by substance use. Fatal overdoses by year fatal overdoses will be available and updated annually 2022 is the most recent year available. In 2022 there were over 4000 suspected opioid overdoses and in 2023 there were over 4500 suspected opioid overdoses. Fatal overdoses will be available and updated annually. In 2022 is the most recent year available. In 2021, there were 991 overdoses and in 2023, 1023 suspected overdoses will be reported by month for each year and year to date. In 2023, Fire EMS responded to an average of 358 suspected overdoses per month in the city, with the highest number in any year during the month of July, above the average with 536 suspected opioid overdose responses. These trends inform our planning, in particular for the summer and the need to incorporate overdose prevention into our efforts when looking at suspected opioid overdoses by age, 66% of all suspected opioid overdoses in 2023 were among people aged 25 to 55 years of age. When looking at fatal overdoses by age group, as shown here, the data mirrors are suspected overdoses where 68% are also among people aged 25 to 50. Majority of suspected overdoses occur among males at 71% and similarly at 78% of our fatal overdoses were among males as well.

Majority of suspected overdoses occur among males at 71% and similarly at 78% of our fatal overdoses were among males as well. This graph shows the number of suspected opioid overdoses per year by housing status and includes the housing status of the patient at the time of the incident as recorded in EPC, with 69% being among housed. Persons experiencing homelessness is indicated for patients where the address is a known shelter or the patient reports they are homeless. In this case, homelessness status is unknown thus, this may be an undercount. This graph shows the total number of fatal overdoses per year caused by any drug or combination of drugs. By housing status, 70% are among housed individuals. Homelessness information is obtained by matching data to Maricopa County's Office of the Medical examiner generated lists of decedents who were known to be homeless at the time of death. Investigators obtain this information from law enforcement reports, hospital reports, and from interviews with family members and next of kin. In some cases, homelessness status is unknown thus may be an undercount. The dashboard will also feature the top five locations for suspected opioid overdoses. These are where responses occurred and may not be where the person consumed their drugs. In 2023, private residence was the most common location suspected overdose with 39%, followed by transportation and roadways with 36% this category includes sidewalks, bus stops, airport, light rail and any location associated with vehicular traffic, including train tracks. The location defined as business accounts for approximately 7% and includes commercial, retail, private businesses. Medical and support services include medical centers, hospitals, substance use treatment centers and account for 4% of the total suspected overdoses. And lastly, transitional housing, which include shelters, campgrounds, hotels and any housing not intended for permanent residents accounted for 4%. All other locations are grouped under other and include locations such as urban environment, which accounted for less than 2% of the total overdoses. This includes parks and athletic fields, which was just over 1%. An interactive map will also display the number of fatal overdoses in 2022. Fatal overdoses caused by any drug or combination of drugs by Zip code. Zip codes will be less, with less than five are not displayed. ZIp codes are represented on this map, may cross multiple city boundaries and counts reflect all intersecting cities and are not constrained by Phoenix city limits. The number of naloxone take home kits by the Office of Public Health Citywide Naloxone program since the program started in August 2023, as reported, by month, over 6700 naloxone kits have been distributed to community. Dashboard features also include, where possible, data is broken down by demographic factors like age, sex, housing, race, ethnicity and location. Graphs allow the user to hover over them to get more detailed information. Charts can be viewed in full screen, downloaded and printed, and, when available, data is shown in interactive maps. The dashboard can be translated into numerous languages and there are links to resources and more information are also provided. Next steps today's launch of the dashboard will also be accompanied by a community campaign to increase community awareness and education, data communication and visualization for the community. Community in phase two, an overdose alert system will be launched by tracking daily trends, informed priorities and planning, and allow for monitoring and evaluation. There are two ways to navigate to the dashboard today, one via the Office of Public health website and two showcased on the phoenixopendata.com site. This concludes the presentation and available for questions at this time. Sotto thank you very much. I'll make a quick comment and see if any of my colleagues have any questions for you. I've played around a little bit with the interactive feature and it is, it's extremely informative. So you and your folks are to be congratulated for that because I think it really adds for the ability for most people, or almost anybody for that matter, to really find out, I think, what is valuable information. So with that, thank you very much. So I'll turn to my colleagues. Does anybody have any questions? Thank you again for the presentation. Very, very informative. I just had a couple of questions regarding some, I guess, a data set that's being considered to be in use. For example, our suspected overdose is being updated monthly versus our fatal overdose are going to be updated annually. And according to this, the last one was 2022. Do we have any timeline or any understanding of when the 2023 data will be provided?

So with that, thank you very much. So I'll turn to my colleagues. Does anybody have any questions? Thank you again for the presentation. Very, very informative. I just had a couple of questions regarding some, I guess, a data set that's being considered to be in use. For example, our suspected overdose is being updated monthly versus our fatal overdose are going to be updated annually. And according to this, the last one was 2022. Do we have any timeline or any understanding of when the 2023 data will be provided? And then my second question is, is there any way we could update this at least maybe twice a year so we can see if we're trending in the right direction versus waiting until, as passed for the fatal overdose information? Yes. Thank you for the question, councilwoman and chair members of the council, to the first point regarding the lag of fatal overdoses in previous years, that is due to suspected not being confirmed cases. And so in order for fatal overdoses to be confirmed, they need to go through the process of the office of the medical examiner at the county level and then verified and confirmed by our local county health department. That does take time, unfortunately, to get all of that confirmatory information and so that we are not providing only provisional data. To your point of can we report, you know, half year, maybe six month increments? That might be possible if we do have some provisional information from the county health department. But that would be, of course, you know, us communicating and learning from them, if provisional information is available at, let's say, the six month mark. Well, I would ask that if it's a possibility for us to at least inquire whether or not provisional information is attainable. We can put an asterisk or some kind of disclaimer on the website to indicate that information is still being verified. But I just think it's important for us to track whether or not we are have a more real time touch on our actual trends in that area. So thank you for that. And my next question was on slide number 16. Based on overdose by location, is it possible to do any further breakdown on the transportation and roadways to see if there is a place that tends to see more suspected overdose type of behavior? So that we could determine whether or not we need to be more specific with our outreach and certainty? I'm just trying to figure out how we can move from data to implementation in a matter that moves the needle for the population. Absolutely. Chair, members of the council, to your point, that is exactly the idea and intention behind creating something like a tool, like a dashboard. We want to have a tool to refer to. To answer your question short, we do have subcategories of the general category of transportation. So there's possibility. And right now on the dashboard, it is reported in aggregate. So, meaning all of those together. But if there is one particular area, we could look into data to see if that is available. And then the other, I was writing notes and based on what I have is that reflects primarily our urban parks. That includes. Yeah, that is included there since they have a small percentage, about 2%, 1%, I believe. Over 1%. Less than two. Yes, that includes other, in other. And just one more question I had was on your slide 20. Just wanted a little more explanation on what was intended on the face rollout. Yes. So phase ii rollout will provide us that time to, as you mentioned earlier, track any trends related to the data that we're seeing as much as possible that would be informed, most likely by our suspected overdose responses, because that is updated monthly through our EMS fire, EMS, EPCR system, as opposed to our fatal information. That, of course, you know, as we mentioned, is a bit more lagged at the annual basis, but our suspected information, it's the first of its kind for us to really refer to local data to inform our planning efforts. And it's really exciting to have this information now at our fingertips and to be able to maybe continue to manipulate it and use it in creative ways and overall to inform our approaches in responding. I'm not sure if I missed it, but when do we anticipate the phase two roll out? Do we have a timeframe? Timeframe is as soon as possible. Today is our official launch of the external dashboard. To note this process did take close to maybe a year or just a little over that, but our phase two really is in motion at the moment. So the fact that we do have our external dashboard now ready for the public know that behind the scenes, we've created our motion for phase two and look forward to sharing that update with subcommittee in the near future. Thank you for answering my questions. Thank you again for the presentation. Very informative, and thank you for the work that you do. That's it? Sure. Thank you for your presentation. Very good.

And we'll welcome to the table acting library director Mitch Machaka and Carl Kendall and Wendy Resnick, deputy library director and the youth services coordinator. So welcome. Good morning, chair Robinson and members of the subcommittee. The Phoenix Public Library connects today's community to a world of possibilities. Last fiscal year, Phoenix Public Libraries welcomed over 2 million visitors to our 17 locations across the city. And now we have our bookmobile that you learned about a couple of months ago, and we will build two new branches. With the passing of the Gobon program, the library has something for everyone in our community, including public programs, computers, classes, ways to start a business, college, access, and obviously, books and programs that provide access to school readiness and early literacy for our young people. I am excited to have my colleagues Carl Kendall, deputy library director, and Wesley Wendy Resnick, children and Teen services coordinator, here today. Carl will present on our annual summer reading program that kicked off registration this month. All council offices will receive information for their newsletters and social media. After this meeting in English and Spanish, Wendy will give an overview of our services to children and teens. And thank you all for supporting the Phoenix public Library. And I've had the pleasure of seeing you at our branches, and I'm hosting a couple of you this coming week. I will now turn the presentation over to Carl to start us out on our adventure of summer reading at the library. Thank you, Mitch. Good morning, chairman Robinson, members of the subcommittee, as Mitch mentioned, I'm going to update you on our summer reading program and provide a brief overview. And Wendy will provide a brief overview of our other programs and services for youth. So we are so excited about our summer reading theme this year, which is advanced venture begins at your library. That's a national theme that you'll see all over the country this year, and it's such an apt way to describe a library to kids. But there's a secret theme that librarians and educators know, and I'll let you guys in on it now. And that is learning doesn't stop in the summer at your library because that's the whole point of summer reading to stem the learning loss when school is out. Studies have shown that students can lose the equivalent of two to four months of learning in the summer, particularly in reading and math. They start the next school year behind, and the effects can be cumulative over time. Our goal as the library is to keep kids reading engaged and having fun in the summer, when it's 115 degrees out. The library is one of the few, and I'll stress this free educational and air conditioning outings for families, which is why our door count is typically up by about 15% during the summer months. We have tons of free programs, everything from african dance troupes to zoo programs, magicians, jugglers, puppets, much more. The game's structured around the recommendation that school age kids read at least 20 minutes a day. Of course, the game is open to all ages, though, and we especially encourage caregivers to sign up with their kids. To set a good example, last summer, more than 23,500 phoenicians participated in the summer reading program. This year we'd like to hit 25,000 and actually surpass that, which would be the highest number that we've had in a decade. So that's what we're going to try to accomplish. We're setting up some special outreaches to other summer programs, like the boys girl clubs, summer school programs at Washington elementary, as well as other school districts, and also our partners in parks and public housing. Our librarians spend this month coming up that we're in now in May, reaching out, going out to schools while they're still in session, presenting to the students and getting them signed up and prepared for the game that starts in June. As part of that, our community relations team created a wonderful promotional video in both English and Spanish to show in the classrooms during those visits, and I'd like to now play one of those videos for you.

We'll see you this summer at the Phoenix Public Library. Happy reading, right? And now I'd like to turn it over to our children and teen services coordinator Wendy Resnick. Thank you Carl, chair, Robinson and subcommittee members. I've been overseeing youth services at Phoenix Public Library for twelve years and I am so proud of what we've accomplished to make the library more child centered. Our work is guided by research and brain development. We are data driven and laser focused on filling the gaps in education. I'm going to give you a brief overview and then we'd be happy to take your questions. So this little guy on the slide is our future. And importantly, 90% of his brain development happens by age five. If he is one of the 22% of youngsters that attend head Start or another high quality childcare program, he is off to a great start. He will likely arrive in kindergarten with the school readiness skills to learn, but if he is not enrolled in a quality program, his bright start is not guaranteed, especially if he is among the almost 30% of Phoenix children growing up in poverty. At Phoenix Public Library, we focus on the second group. Our strategy is to empower the caregivers, whether they are parents, grandparents, aunties, nannies, or teachers, to make sure they are doing their level best. To prepare children for school, we do workshops with the caregivers, but even our storytime programs are adult education with singing and dancing. We also engage our community partners who work with these families to expand and amplify our programs. For the purposes of library collections, programs and services, we divide the youth market into three age groups, the birth to five school age children and teens with the youngest children. Our focus is on early literacy and school readiness skills, skills and of course, supporting the caregivers. During the elementary years, the focus shifts to stem and steam learning. We work more with teachers at this point by doing classroom visits and library tours, and for teens, the focus is on providing a safe and nonjudgmental environment and a sense of agency. Let's talk about birth to five. I didn't know a lot about that particular segment when I took this job, but I quickly learned how foundational it is. Not only is the architecture of the brain developing, but there is a pruning process going on as well to remove neural connections that are not stimulated. That's why we had to make storytime much more intentional. It's more scripted now. Every program begins with a specific early learning message, and then all the activities in the program support that message. It's still fun, but it's purposeful. Our presenters use the IWIU model I demonstrate. We do it together, you do it at home. And we spend a lot more time now training and supporting our staff to do this important work. We've also created new school readiness programs for three to five year olds, kindergarten bootcamp, and tools for school, which are based on Arizona standards for kindergarten. We hired a kindergarten teacher to create the curriculum because teachers were telling us that the biggest obstacle to getting children reading on grade level by third grade is kindergarteners who lacked the foundational skills to learn. It's such a slow start if they're not ready. And it's not just abcs, although that's part of it, but it's the social emotional skills that prepare a child to listen, to follow directions, to take turns, to participate in discussion. One of the first rules of boot camp is that children must answer questions in complete sentences, which doesn't sound like a big deal, but that can be really hard for a four year old who's not used to having a back and forth conversation with adults. More than 3500 children have been through this seven week program. Last year we rolled out a new year round reading program called 1000 books before kindergarten, which simply reminds grownups how important it is to read to children every day. Finally, we worked with the Office of Youth and Education to bring two family resource centers to libraries, one at Burton Bar and one at Cesar Chavez Library in Levine. These one stop centers offer referrals and programming for families on everything from car safety to nutrition. And I would be remiss if I did not mention the support we have received for this work from, first things first, several million dollars over the last dozen years from the state agency that is funded by tobacco taxes. Our programming philosophy extends to our children's spaces. Every library has some elements of intentional ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Phoenix Public Library", "insights": [{"observation": "Our work is guided by research and brain development.

Last year we rolled out a new year round reading program called 1000 books before kindergarten, which simply reminds grownups how important it is to read to children every day. Finally, we worked with the Office of Youth and Education to bring two family resource centers to libraries, one at Burton Bar and one at Cesar Chavez Library in Levine. These one stop centers offer referrals and programming for families on everything from car safety to nutrition. And I would be remiss if I did not mention the support we have received for this work from, first things first, several million dollars over the last dozen years from the state agency that is funded by tobacco taxes. Our programming philosophy extends to our children's spaces. Every library has some elements of intentional play because play is the business of children and it's how they learn. Pictured on this slide is the amazing light changing wall that is part of a large installation at Burton Bar. This is a great cause and effect interactive for children that teaches early stem concepts. And then on the bottom of the slide is a pretend library at Desert Sage. What's lovely about this piece is it's so easy to configure it to be a post office or a bank or a puppet theater theater. So it provides great imaginative play. And these exhibits are all designed and manufactured by a local woman owned business that specializes in museum quality installations for libraries. With our grade school kids, we've moved from crayons to coding. The big focus is stem and steam programs. The library led the way with teaching, coding and robotics. Many of our libraries have weekly stem and makerspace programs. Here we have a young girl trying out augmented reality for the first time, and also a picture of some of the thousands of customers who participated in our solar eclipse gatherings. These are often the kinds of programs, hands on programs, that are being cut from school curriculums. Of course, as Carl mentioned, we have summer reading and special programs during school breaks. We have a lot of passive activities, so there's always something new to explore. When the library was shuttered because of COVID we put together book bags for kids and teens and tens of thousands of take home craft kits that they could pick up at curbside. Ten years ago, we started the amazing Library card campaign, which created a huge boost in classroom visits. Every fall, we reach out to schools all over Phoenix to make sure students have library cards. We routinely issue three to 5000 new cards every season. We've also built strong partnerships with other city departments. The library is a founding member of Redon Phoenix, the community collective led by Tim Valencia and the Office of Youth and Education. We work with parks and rec to do story times in parks, and we created three permanent story walk trails at Chavez Park, Edison park and Harmon park. Finally, we've been partnering with public housing on a book rich environment grant through housing and urban development. Every year we receive ten to 15,000 new children's books for distribution in public housing and through outreach to surrounding communities. Because the data is clear, children who grow up in homes with books are more successful. The last but not least, our teens. You know, teen Central at Burton Bar has been around for more than 20 years, and it was we were the second library in the country to designate a dedicated teen space. Our motto has always been bi and four teens. We let them lead, we let them run teen councils, plan events, pursue their interests. And I brought copies of this, which I'll give you afterwards. But this is a great example. This is a zine that the teens in Maryvale put together with the librarian at Palo Verde library. They chose a theme of mental health, and it's just really an outstanding piece. Teens need to have a safe space where they can relax with their friends. You know about college depot and how it provides a pathway to higher education, assisting teens and families with applications, scholarships and financial aid. But did you know that for thousands of kids, the library was their first job? Carl was a teen volunteer not that long ago. A couple years ago, many of my volunteers have gone on to work at libraries. We hire teen volunteers year round, but especially in the summer. This year we will have more than 150 teens helping out with our summer reading program and we take that seriously. They have to apply through the city volunteer portal. They have to have interviews and lots of customer service training. And my hope is that they keep that volunteer job on their resumes because it's evidence of a committed and focused future leader. That concludes my overview. Thank you so much for listening to us today. We really appreciate it. Thank you, guys. It was a wonderful presentation. I want to make a couple quick comments and I'll check with my colleagues for questions. But when you talk about the importance of foundational reading and learning, I couldn't be more agreeable with that issue. I think, you know, I teach criminology at Arizona State University and one of the things we do know when it comes to studying criminology, kids who have a poor start, poor reading skills, and everything along those lines have a tendency to veer off into a life of criminality. So what you're doing is important to the future of our communities. And I really thank you for that. And the last mention, I will make a little bit of a plug for district six. We're going to be at Century library tomorrow. I think we're going to be filming a segment with a local author, a woman by the name of Alexandra Bracken.

So we're going to do our part to really push all things library out for you this summer. Really appreciate all that you were doing. So with that, do I have any questions from any of my colleagues? I have a question. I had more of a comment. I owe Mitch, Carl, Wendy, phenomenal presentation. Libraries make me happy. I go back to my middle school and high school. I spent a lot of time in the library, precursor to my career as a lawyer, where I knew it would have to be reading. But I do agree with what chair mentioned. It's a very important foundation for our next generation. Thank you for all that you do. And we are looking forward to ways that we, our office and district eight can partner on some of the initiatives, whether or not it's ensuring the summer reading program as a success, as well as additional spaces or volunteers. So thank you for all that you do, and I'm confident that we will exceed the 25,000 and students participate in the reading. Thank you again. Thank you, Councilman, Mister chairman and members of the committee, I applaud the work of the staff that's here today. I had a chance to visit with them a couple of weeks ago and saw firsthand their dedication, their complete commitment to children of all ages. And I was the beneficiary of a summer reading program at the Hayden Public Library. So I know how important, important those summer activities are, especially helping to keep kids focused on something and somebody who was mischievous as I was, it was really beneficial to me. I am all for the goal of 25k plus. I think you all will reach it. And I look forward to stopping by again, not just at Burton Bar, which is one of the gems of district seven, but also to visit other public libraries within district and to check in on the program and hopefully participate in some way. Thank you. I guess I'll have to comment, too. Now, of course, who doesn't love a library? I got to tell you, one of my favorite little programs are the seeds. And so my son loves to garden. And I think he was inspired by the Phoenix library in your program. There being no additional questions, do I have a motion? It's just for information. No, there is no, it's just for information. Right. Okay. Sorry about that. Thank you very much then. Got ahead of myself. The next item is item number ten. Mitch Machaka will stay at the will remain at the table and as the city's arts and culture director. And we'll welcome Kerry Brown Table as well. Oh, yes. All right. Well, good morning again, chair Robinson and members of the subcommittee. Since its establishment in 1987, the arts and culture department's public art program has been a national model for involving artists in designing and building a better city. The program enhances the look, feel, and function of a wide range of public buildings, spaces, and infrastructure by fostering collaborations among artists, engineers, landscape architects, and other urban designers and thinkers. Beyond an aesthetic impact on the community, the arts can help solve civic issues like security and heat mitigation. They have an economic impact on the community and jobs for our residents, not only for our artists, but also for the fabricators and trades professionals who bring these projects to life. The department develops the plan annually with input and assistance from mayor and council, city residents, artists and city departments, and the Phoenix Arts and Culture Commission, which approved this plan at their last meeting. The plan identifies and budgets public art projects citywide, coinciding with the annual Capital Improvement Program budget each year. My colleague Carrie Brown, deputy arts and culture director, will give an overview of the fiscal year 24 29 plan and ask for your recommendation to the city council to approve the plan at their next formal meeting. Thank you for supporting our community's arts and culture. I'll now turn it over to Kerry. Thanks, Mitch. Good morning, chair Robertson, members of the subcommittee. I'm excited to be be here today to share with you some highlights from our 2024 to 2029 public art plan. So, as you know, city council established the percent for Art Ordinance in 1986, which requires 1% of capital improvement program funds to be invested in public art and requires our department, arts and culture, to submit an annual five year public art plan. This year's plan totals just over $25 million and includes 13 new projects. This budget is $5.2 million higher than last year's plan and our largest five year budget to date. That increase is largely due to a major expansion project at Sky Harbor Airport, which we are already working with the aviation department on. The public art projects included in the plan are prioritized based on opportunities to integrate artwork into individual cipher projects and their potential to impact the surrounding neighborh", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Arts and Culture Department", "insights": [{"observation": "Since its establishment in 1987, the arts and culture department's public art program has been a national model for involving artists in designing and building a better city.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The program enhances the look, feel, and function of a wide range of public buildings, spaces, and infrastructure by fostering collaborations among artists, engineers, landscape architects, and other urban designers and thinkers.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Beyond an aesthetic impact on the community, the arts can help solve civic issues like security and heat mitigation.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "They have an economic impact on the community and jobs for our residents, not only for our artists, but also for the fabricators and trades professionals who bring these projects to life.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The department develops the plan annually with input and assistance from mayor and council, city residents, artists and city departments, and the Phoenix Arts and Culture Commission, which approved this plan at their last meeting.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The plan identifies and budgets public art projects citywide, coinciding with the annual Capital Improvement Program budget each year.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "City council established the percent for Art Ordinance in 1986, which requires 1% of capital improvement program funds to be invested in public art and requires our department, arts and culture, to submit an annual five year public art plan.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "This year's plan totals just over $25 million and includes 13 new projects.

This year's plan totals just over $25 million and includes 13 new projects. This budget is $5.2 million higher than last year's plan and our largest five year budget to date. That increase is largely due to a major expansion project at Sky Harbor Airport, which we are already working with the aviation department on. The public art projects included in the plan are prioritized based on opportunities to integrate artwork into individual cipher projects and their potential to impact the surrounding neighborhood. The plan focuses on the equitable distribution of funds as allowable by the ordinance and the diversification of the public art collection through broadening types of opportunities, as well as continued outreach to new artists and new arts organizations. Of the 48 projects included in the plan, nine address major retrofit or refurbishments, seven support citywide initiatives like heat mitigation, and three are a component of long range planning efforts like Rio reimagined. So I wanted to share a few highlights from the plan. First, these are some of our new projects, including the terminal expansion project I previously mentioned. In addition, we'll be working with the street transportation department on Dobbins Road and third street improvements with the water department on a new reservoir in North Phoenix and also repairing Sonoran Desert Drive, a roadway project in in District two and the dreamy draw pedestrian bridge in District three. We've also included in the plan percent for art funding from the Gobond program. We've had some preliminary discussions with departments about the projects listed here, but nothing is final just yet. We'll be working closely with the project managers and department leadership to evaluate each project and to determine the best opportunities for public art within each proposition. Here you see some of our continuing projects like 100 West Washington, which will be the new police headquarters and the Grand Canal project in Maryvale. We also have several parks projects, including Lone Mountain, Levine and South Mountain parks, as well as Cortez park and well site, which is nearing completion of the design concept and finally McDowell Road and Deer Valley Airport, which are still in the early planning phases. The vast majority of our projects take multiple years to complete, so you'll see several of them listed in more than one plan and a few more of our continuing projects that will be completed this fiscal year, including the 32nd Street Drought pipeline Streetscape project, which is currently being fabricated, and the Solano park project, which will be begin its installation later this month. We also anticipate completing an interior mural for the pavement center at 305 West Washington, and the relocation of Bloom Canopy, an artist design shade structure, to El Reposo park. One of our new long term initiatives is to replace, repair and produce identification plaques and interpretive signage. As you can imagine, some of our signage is outdated and some even non existent, so this initiative will assess the entire public art collection and ensure every project is properly identified. And we're also continuing our collaborative neighborhood projects with our two pilot projects with hatcher Urban businesses and the Bellroad Business alliance. The map included in the plan shown here highlights new and continuing projects, but does not include long term initiatives or the go bond projects as those will occur in multiple locations. Mapping out the projects like this helps us to evaluate the distribution of funds and identify what projects will best meet our program goals and provide meaningful opportunities for artists. And last but not least, I wanted to highlight our most recent achievement that is being selected as one of eight winners of Bloomberg Philanthropy's public art challenge. This prestigious grant award supports temporary public art projects that address important civic issues in cities nationwide. Our project, which is a partnership with the Office of Innovation, the Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, and the Parks and Recreation Department, will commission nine artists to create shade and cooling installations in response to extreme urban heat. These projects will be installed in parks throughout the city in the spring of 2025, and the grant will culminate in a free one day festival at Steele Indian School park in September 2025. And with that, I'm happy to answer any questions. Okay, thank you very much. I will open the floor for additional comments or questions from my colleagues. Questions? Okay. If not, do I have a motion? Have a motion in a second. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Chair votes aye. The motion carries. Thank you very much. Appreciate all the hard work you guys are doing.

So, gentlemen, thank you very much, and we'll turn it over to you. Eric. Good morning, Chairman, members of the subcommittee, we appreciate the opportunity today to talk about some of the successes and great efforts that have come out of our partnership with our greater Phoenix Economic Council partners and also explain to you the high value return that we get from this contract before we ask for some more funding for it. With that, today we have Brad Schmidt, the executive vice president of GPAC, and Nathan Wright, our deputy director for business attraction. With that, I'll hand it off to Nate. Eric, I have the privilege of working closely with GPEC in my role in business attraction. The city of Phoenix was a founding member back in 1989 for GPEC. And they really are the single most important partner that we have in helping create great jobs for the citizens of Phoenix. And they're consistently ranked as the top economic development organization in the country. And that's just not by popularity. It's based on raw data, which is total prospects, total jobs, total investment. I think that's seven times in a row that they've won that award, and they really do make us look good. They're traveling the country, actually, they're traveling the world, going to trade shows, engaging with companies, marketing the Valley, Phoenix and Greater Phoenix. And they've been instrumental in every major announcement that we've had in the valley over the years. And just a quick example of this is back in 2016, a company came into the valley. They ultimately decided it wasn't the right time on the exit interview, though. GPEC engaged with them and wrote down a list of why they didn't decide to locate. They worked on the list, they stay engaged with the company. And then in 2019, the mayor and others traveled to Taiwan, to TSMC, were able to show how they solved for all their concerns and ultimately resulted in one of the largest investments in our country's history. So they provide tremendous value. With that, I'll turn the time over to, to Brad. All right. Good morning, chair Robinson, members of the subcommittee, my pleasure to be here today and thank you again for your continued investment with the Greater Phoenix Economic Council. Again, my name is Brad Smith. I'm the senior vice president of our business development group. I've been with GPAC for over 24 years now and really enjoy working at a regional economic development level. And if you're not familiar with the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, we are the, actually the, we were ranked the 8th time in a row as one of the top economic development organizations in the country by a lot of site selector, site selection consultants and companies that we work with across the country and internationally. We work with our 22 member communities throughout the greater Phoenix area, along with two counties. And really our goal is to provide data driven research to companies to help them make that relocation decision into the greater Phoenix area. So we're providing them a wide variety of data on labor cost comparisons, tax information, et cetera, to help them in their process of finalizing a location here within the United States, hopefully Arizona, and hopefully the city of Phoenix and across the greater Phoenix area. It's our 34th year in business. We've helped, we say assisted over 1000 companies in location decision here into the metropolitan area. And I say assist because it's not just GPEC that is involved in this process, it is certainly we work hand in hand with our communities and with our state partners at the Arizona Commerce Authority. One of the other roles that we provide is really to not only attract and grow quality businesses, as you see there on our mission, but to advocate for the competitiveness of the greater Phoenix area. And doing that by working with mayor and councils throughout the region, as well as our state legislature and the governor's office to ensure that this area, this region, the state, remains competitive for these high value, high capital investment and high wage job projects. If you look at our, over the last five years, we've assisted again over 214 locates into the greater Phoenix area. 76 of these, which is about 35%, have located within the city of Phoenix, creating over 13,800 jobs and over $36 billion and new capital investment. Again, this is a team effort with our partners at the economic development offices at the city, along with other groups as well, universities, private sector businesses, et cetera. Certainly the city of Phoenix benefits from projects and the activities that we are involved in occurring across the region. Our locates, our assisted locates have created over 25,000 jobs region wide for the city of Phoenix residents over the past five years. And we have multiple studies to show that employees that will live and spend in all the greater Phoenix communities. So as the company locates here within the greater Phoenix area, people tend to spend money if they work at that location. They tend to spend money either near where they live or not near where they work. And so again, those companies those jobs and wages are really benefiting a lot of different cities within the area. So again, when a company selects a greater Phoenix area, all communities benefit, really.

So again, when a company selects a greater Phoenix area, all communities benefit, really. With increased tax revenues across the metro area. Here are our numbers as of March 31 this fiscal year. 24. You'll see we have a little over $342 million in payroll generated, created little over 5000 jobs and 35 assisted locates, of which 2662 have been high wage jobs with an average salary of over a little over $68,203 right now, our qualified prospects for this fiscal year through the end of March, 197 new prospects and we'll talk a little bit about kind of what those prospects look like here in a minute. This fiscal year, again through March 31, we've had a very attractive and busy year. We're about 113% of our current fiscal year goal and about 112% of over where we were last year at the same time period. I'm pleased to say our international prospects continue to be very active right now, especially with TSMC's expansion here in the market. We're seeing a lot of interest from APAC regions, Europe, etcetera, especially in semiconductor manufacturing, a lot in EV battery manufacturing and other advanced manufacturing type operations. Again, the 35 companies you see there that have located this fiscal year have created over $2.5 billion in capital investment and over 5100 new jobs in the area. And I'll walk you through some of the locates that we've seen this fiscal year. This is a good sampling of what the activity that the city of Phoenix is seeing. About four semiconductor suppliers. The average salary of all these companies is over 80,000, $82,000. The capital investment of these companies on the average is about $24 million. And yeah, over 2400 jobs total. You see bioscience and healthcare companies here, two of them a food company, Olum Nuts. Advanced manufacturing continues to be very active. Over 70% of what we see providing really, really high wage jobs. And we're happy to see some office activity with Peckham. That was the largest, the top office deal in calendar year 2023. Over 600 jobs. And a new office there with Republic Services. New headquarters. Pass it over to Brad. I mentioned earlier the 197 prospects we've seen so far this fiscal year since the start of COVID We saw a trend towards a lot more industrial projects. You see there. Our industrial prospects are about 80% of our overall pipeline, meaning an office is about 20%. A majority of our office projects have been smaller as a lot of companies, certainly those that employ a lot of people in office type environments, are still struggling somewhat with their kind of return to office policies and getting people and their employees back into those office spaces. So the need for those kind of larger spaces that we've seen throughout the region and the city of Phoenix is still kind of evolving. Pleased to say we have seen in the last about two months about five new prospects with over 1000 jobs in the office sector. So I think we're seeing slowly kind of a return to some of these type of projects. Our industrial deals have been very active again with about 80% of our overall pipeline. Most of them are over 100,000. There has been a lot of reshoring activity and activity again from our international prospects. I think with the IRA, a lot of uS legislation, IRA, the Chips act is really pushing a lot of new investment, certainly for high tech advanced manufacturing projects into the United States. And I think Arizona, greater Phoenix, is certainly a beneficiary of that investment. So with that, we're seeing groups like solar cell panel manufacturing, electric vehicles, battery manufacturing for both cars, and long term energy storage, certainly semiconductor supply chain with TSMCs and Intel's expansion here in the market, aerospace, aviation, as well as other warehousing and light industrial projects that serve to service the population here in the market. Brad. And as you see, there's tremendous value gained to the city of Phoenix by this partnership. $138 of direct revenue for every dollar invested by the city. The cities make up about 40% of GPEC's overall budget with the private sector, the other 60%. And we're here today. You know, each year the request fluctuates because it's based upon population. And today population counts. It's about $823,701 that we're asking for for this next fiscal year. And with that, I'll pass it over to Eric Johnson. Thank you. And that concludes our presentation. We'd be happy to answer any questions that you have. Okay, Eric, Brad and Nathan, thank you very much.

Passes unanimously. Thank you, gentlemen, very much. Really appreciate it. Like I said, the presentation was exceptional and really appreciate the information. That was the last item for today. Well, actually, the last item today is a call to the public. I know we have a couple of speakers, and the first I have is Elizabeth Venable. Hello. Good morning. Salama puggy. In any case, I wanted to talk today about something that kind of frames the way I perceive my reality, that you might not expect, although some of you might expect at this point. And that is the concept of performance management, when you're looking at the ways that housing resources are allocated and. And how to reconceptualize success and how we can achieve success. And one of the things that I've had a problem with is sometimes the budget allocations that seem to accompany housing or homelessness projects, you know, they don't correspond with the outcomes. And sometimes the outcomes of the projects that receive larger amounts of funding actually are pretty poor and they're more ideological, such as the, you know, I won't call it safe because. But the unsafe outdoor space, you know, which can cause organ damage regardless of whether or not fatalities occur, you know, that costs $10.4 million. Almost nobody is utilizing it. Compared to the so called capacity of that space. That is more money than was given to the affordable housing units, for example, where you could, you can house, you know, literally 400, if not more people, you know, depending on how strict the rules are on how many people can live in an apartment, right. That $9 million, great investment, you know, the three years of an outdoor lot where people, you know, only have the option to sleep outside and there's cooling only in the day. Like, you know, these are things that really need to be reconsidered under performance management. I would offer the concepts of diversity, looking at diverse populations, not just leading, quote unquote, with services, which is basically only offering housing for SMI and substance users upfront after they go through certain programs. I would offer addressing though, people with substance use disorder in a way that allows them to lower the barriers so that they don't overdose on the streets. And they're more likely to accept, you know, services and treatment because they're receiving housing that may be actually low barrier as opposed to the unsafe outdoor space. I think it's important to consider what are the limitations are on spaces. I also think it's important to have some form of oversight over to what is funded because a lot of these spaces have, like, black mold. The people are getting kicked out in a month because the vouchers are running out. I'm not. I'm talking about multiple facilities funded, I think, through the city and, you know, are dangerous sometimes. And it's like, do I report them or do I not? Because will they be closed because the black mold, things like that. So I would really consider just upping the performance management concept and looking to where the failures are. Okay, Elizabeth, thank you very much. Next we have Frank Urban. Hello there. I am with fund for empowerment. Like Elizabeth, I would like to speak on housing. We need more affordable housing, especially for the homeless. I'm talking housing affordable for everyone because there's just. There's not enough housing put. To put point. To put it point blankly. And like Elizabeth said, you know, it has to be. It has to be not only affordable but appropriate for the person. Like, say a person with a pet, like a dog or something. The shelter that they go to should accept animals or for SMI. They should have counselors and treatment options for them and same thing for, you know, the same thing for the substance abuse. They should have counselors and programs to get them off the drugs and such and. Or the alcohol, whichever. And with that, I'll close. Okay, Frank, thank you very much. Next we have Tony Harris. Thank you. Yeah, I saw the funding, the budget chart, and it seemed like the funding for homeless is pretty low considering the amount of homeless people are either coming in town from other states to Phoenix. And I've met a lot of people, like, in not just this area, but like, North Phoenix and West Phoenix, that they don't have nowhere to go in the daytime except for, like, fast food restaurants to cool off and there's not enough cooling centers for these people. I know they opened up the one at the main library 24 hours, but there should be funding to open up other cooling centers. Like, for instance, when they had the convention center open for the homeless people to go in daytime in the summer for the respite a few years ago. And then on top of that, you have landlords that are price gouging people out of their apartments. And thank God the state attorney general has a lawsuit in on them. The collusion with a real page. And a lot of those people are having it being kicked on to the streets because they can't afford the rent from those private landlords. And so they're going to need affordable housing also to compete with these private landlords. Thank you, city council. Tony. Thank you very much.

Item 21 is in council district five. I will turn. Well, I guess before we turn to councilman Guardado for a motion, we will turn to the city clerk's office and officer Chester to provide comments. We'll begin with Deputy City clerk Benavidez. Welcome. Good afternoon, mayor, members of the council. I'm Kristin Lekhire Benavidez, deputy city clerk with the city clerk's office. With me today is Officer Samantha Chester with the Phoenix Police Department. This request is for acquisition of control for an existing series twelve restaurant liquor license. This location is currently licensed for liquor sales. The 60 day limit for processing this application is April 4, 2024. Staff recommends disapproval of this application based on a police department recommendation for disapproval. The police department disapproval is based upon concerns with the applicant's employment history and involvement with locations with the history of liquor license violations. The applicant has not demonstrated the capability, qualifications and reliability to hold and control a liquor license. Thank you so much. Good afternoon. My name is Officer Samantha Chester. I work at the Cactus park precinct. Thank you all for allowing me to be here today to present on this. I'm going to be speaking to everyone on La Constanta Taco and Sushi, located at 26 47 West Glendale Avenue. My recommendation of denial of Mister Vega Caro from obtaining a series twelve liquor license at La Constanta Taco and Sushi is based off of the following facts that I discovered throughout the course of my investigation. After receiving the liquor application, the specific issues are regarding Mister Vega Caro's past and current employment prior calls for service by police, a liquor inspection and the results, an enforcement operation and the results, and failing to submit paperwork in a timely manner for a full investigation to be completed by the police department. In regards to the first item, his employment. After receiving the liquor application and while waiting for the city questionnaire, a preliminary review was conducted which showed a majority of the establishments Mister Vega Caro listed as his previous and current places of employment revealed multiple liquor violations per the Arizona Department of Liquor Licensing control. It should be noted regarding his previous and current place current places of employment Mister Vega Caro listed his employment began at each of these places in January of 2011 and stated he was still currently working there today based on his dates of employment he listed on the application, my investigation spans from January 20 eleven to March 6 of 2024, when my denial was authored in regards to his prior places of employment and the violations that come with it. The first one is going to be Club XTC, which is now laboom nightclub and there was four violations by DLLC at that location. The second one was Club Paris. There was five liquor violations at this location. In regards to his current places of employment. La Constanta, Taco and Sushi, which is the establishment that we're speaking of today, has had seven liquor violations at that location. The Silverado cantabar had three violations and Club Silverado has 14. In regards to the second item, which is calls for service at Club Silverado, which is one of the establishments that Mister Vega Caro indicated that he wor", "esg_v1": [{"name": "La Constanta Taco and Sushi", "insights": [{"observation": "The police department disapproved the liquor license application based upon the applicant's employment history and involvement with locations with a history of liquor license violations.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The applicant has not demonstrated the capability, qualifications and reliability to hold and control a liquor license.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "There were multiple liquor violations at previous and current places of employment of the applicant as per the Arizona Department of Liquor Licensing control.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "La Constanta Taco and Sushi", "insights": [{"observation": "The police department disapproved the liquor license application based upon the applicant's employment history and involvement with locations with a history of liquor license violations.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The applicant has not demonstrated the capability, qualifications and reliability to hold and control a liquor license.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "There were multiple liquor violations at previous and current places of employment of the applicant as per the Arizona Department of Liquor Licensing control.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 361972, "chunk_end_time": 852870, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz6B6Ac9s7M", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz6B6Ac9s7M&t=361s"}, {"start": 9000, "end": 15000, "text": "Mister Vega Caro listed his employment began at each of these places in January of 2011 and stated he was still currently working there today based on his dates of employment he listed on the application, my investigation spans from January 20 eleven to March 6 of 2024, when my denial was authored in regards to his prior places of employment and the violations that come with it.

La Constanta, Taco and Sushi, which is the establishment that we're speaking of today, has had seven liquor violations at that location. The Silverado cantabar had three violations and Club Silverado has 14. In regards to the second item, which is calls for service at Club Silverado, which is one of the establishments that Mister Vega Caro indicated that he works at, we had an issue in January of 2023, community action officers and liquor detectives from the state were conducting a liquor inspection at Club Silverado when they observed a male at a bottle service table drinking from the bottle. They informed Mister Vega Caro, who was on site at the establishment and was listed as the manager in the report of the violation they were observing, they did inform him the club would be given an administrative violation. In regards to La Constanta from February 16, 2023 to February 16 of 2024, I conducted an investigation into the calls for service at this location. Between this timeframe, eleven calls for service were specifically linked with La Constanta, which is units eleven through 14. Two notable violent incidents occurred in this timeframe. The first incident was one on June 16 of 2021 regarding an aggravated assault with a firearm. The second incident was September 15 of 2021 regarding an assault in the September 15 report. When the report was authored, patrol referred to the establishment as a nightclub, which is indicative of the atmosphere the establishment was presenting to customers and police. This establishment has a series twelve liquor license, and when officers have been inside in the late evening hours, including myself, it gives off an impression that it's operating more as a series six liquor license establishment. Some of the indications that are indicative of that is there is security at the door, patting people down, the music is deafening inside, and there is bottle service, all of which do not typically happen at a restaurant with a series twelve liquor license. Another one of the items, the enforcement operation that was recently conducted by my squad as well as state liquor detectives from the Department of Liquor License and Control. They had received an anonymous tip that there was underage drinking occurring at La Constanta on Tuesday nights, most notably occurring around midnight. Due to this information, officers and state liquor detectives conducted an enforcement operation on March 5 of 2024. Just last month, when our officers and liquor detectives from the state were conducting the enforcement, four additional liquor violations were discovered at the establishment. They were advised by the state liquor detectives they would be given another administrative violation. One of these included a violation of ARS 4244.23, which is serving more than the law allows. This was shown by an individual who was found inside at a bottle service table pouring his own alcohol from a liquor bottle into his own glass. In addition to the liquor violation, it should be noted that bottle service is consistent with a series six liquor license, not a series twelve. And lastly, failure to submit a city questionnaire in time. My investigation summary and recommendation was due to our administrative licensing investigator by March 4, 2024. The city questionnaire was not given to me until March 5 of 2024 after business hours. This did not allow me sufficient time to schedule and conduct an interview with the applicant while still meeting the deadline required by licensing. And as far as my personal experience goes, before I was in this position, I was a patrol officer in the area. I have responded to La Constanta, the Silverado Cantabar and Club Silverado on numerous occasions for extremely violent crimes. Due to the aforementioned factors and the fact that the applicant failed to submit the city questionnaire in time for the police department to conduct an interview with him in accordance with the Arizona Revised statute 4203 A, he is not capable, qualified or reliable to own and operate a liquor license within the city of Phoenix. Thank you. Thank you, officer Chester. I'll now turn to councilman Guardado for a motion. Thank you, mayor. Based on the reasons stated by staff, I move disapproval on item 20 1. Second.

Have a motion? A second. Diane Barker. Good afternoon, mayor and council. I was just wondering, because I haven't heard from planning, if they really are looking at and covering the downtown area. You know, the downtown area is much larger than this enhanced area. Now, I'm looking at the 2022 report from downtown Phoenix, Inc. And this, you know, extending the bioscience. And like that, it looks like it's following the downtown Phoenix, Inc. But if you look at the downtown zoned area, this is only a quarter of it. And what I'm submitting to you, when I go to a meeting, such as my neighborhood meeting, there's a city planning that's coming in, looking to changing the zoning around Portland on down to McKinley Bicentral, they say around the light rail to, I forget how many stories, but it's high rise. So, you know, we're expanding, plus we're going to build a high rise up at McDowell. I submit to you that we need to look at the downtown area of the expansion and where you're planning these larger properties and get up with today's future. Thank you so much for that testimony. This is an exciting item for bioscience. We'll add several properties, including our partners with ASU and U of A. To the district, and we can work even more closely together to advance the great work happening downtown. Any additional comments? Roll call. Mordado. Yes Hodge Washington. Yes O'Brien. Yes. Pastor. Yes Robinson. Yes Stark. Yes. Diego. Yes passes 70, item 45 is a fire code amendment change. Will the city clerk please read the title? Item 45 is for ordinance g 7242 and ordinance authorizing amendments to the 2018 International Fire Code with Phoenix amendments and authorizing modifications to the Phoenix Fire Prevention fee schedule. Phoenix City Code, chapter 15, appendix A councilwoman pastor, do you have a motion? I move item 45 2nd. We have a motion and a second. Thank you to our team as well as the fire safety advisory board for their important work on this item. Among the components of this vote will be a forward motion on reducing bureaucracy for solar and energy storage. We'll be able to offer a combination permit that will reduce permitting costs by 50% for solar and battery installations at single family residential locations when they are submitted together. So part of our ongoing effort for sustainability and to reduce red tape. Any additional comments? Roll call. Guardado. Yes Hodge Washington. Yes O'Brien. Yes. Pastor. Yes Robinson. Yes. Stark. Yes. Gallego. Yes. Passes 70, item 48 is to apply for firefighting grant assistance. Councilman Pastor, do you have a motion? I move item 48 2nd. We have a motion and a second. This is an exciting item. We've been working and talking with the fire chief about this for quite some time. We'll be applying for a federal grant for a very innovative program. We'll be able to, if selected for the grant, be able to provide real time monitoring for firefighters who wish to participate, particularly around heat and some of the stress around physical absorption. I'm very hopeful that this will help us protect our firefighters, particularly when they are working outdoor in temperatures that exceed 100 degrees. We think about heat in the summer year round at the city of Phoenix, including making sure that we can provide the best support to our own employees. Our fire department has gotten national attention and has even consulted internationally on strategies around heat, and this is another opportunity for us to continue to be innovative and to protect those who protect all of us. Any additional comments? Roll call. Guardado. Yes Hodge Washington. Yes. O'Brien. Yes. Pastor. Yes. Robinson. Yes. Stark. Yes. Gallego. Yes. Passes 70.

For the record, Steven Nolan. I live at the 85023 zip code. Have for near 40 years. First, thank you, mayor and city council members. I'm here to oppose this item at this time. And the reason I'd like to address it to you is there's many moving parts when dealing with this property turf paradise. It's involved in litigations in which this land isn't tied up. In one that's been going on 14 years, one that's been going on for ten years against the racing commission and the Arizona Department of Racing. The concern is we don't know what's going to happen to the property. The property owner says there is no current buyer. For that reason, I don't see any need for urgency to push this forward until more information can be gathered. Their valley felt that way and they continued it until certain dates went by. Racing commission meetings. Whether or not the property was going to be purchased by the original applicant and Mister Watkins. I'd like to speak about that in 1 second, but with no urgency involved. This next week is another racing commission meeting. There's a horseman agreement with the permit holder and the property owner due on April 15, and whether on June 30, the current permit runs out. Now, council states that this is just trying to bring the property all into one compliance. But it's far more complicated than that. This has been horse racing since the fifties. The properties has always been under the jurisdiction of regulatory bodies, the department of racing, and now, which is now a division of gaming, each person had to qualify to buy that property. They had to be vetted. Unfortunately, in 2000, when this applicant, this current applicant, on these applications, he was less than truthful. He was then suspended a year for falsifying that original application. If I could just finish one item. The original application is not the same application brought to you today. It had a site plan, it had a different person, it had. The aesthetics were going to be brought. Beautiful. He walked away September 15. It's back in the original person that owns the property's application, who's allowed that property to become deplorable. It's been. That property was fined 150,000 by the feds last year. Hisa, for safety concerns on the property. Just table it. Let's try to gather as much information and make the best decision for our community. And I thank you for your time. Thank you. We have Paul Gilbert, Gregory Freeman and Matthew Poole available to speak if necessary. It looks like Mister Gilbert, would you. We will welcome Paul Gilbert on behalf of the applicant. Thank you for your record. My name is Paul Gilbert. I represent Jerry Simms, who owns Turf Paradise. I just want to focus on the fact we are here to talk about land use issues. This is the only issue that is before the city council at this time. Most of the arguments that have been surfaced by Mister Nolan do not address land use issues. They deal with problems, alleged problems dealing with the racing commission, etcetera. From alangeous point of view, we are here with a recommendation of approval from the staff. We're here with a recommendation of approval from the village on the general plan amendment. No recommendation from the village on the zoning. And that is because they continued the case. And then we showed up three times and they didn't have a quorum. So at the end of that period, the chairman of the village committee suggested, and we agreed with his suggestion, that maybe it was time to move on and take the case forward, which we did. So they have not recommended denial or approval either way. The planning commission voted unanimously to support this for the general plan amendment, and voted seven one to support it for the zoning. We were asked to reach out to the neighborhood groups by the staff, which we did. And I'll just quickly add that the groups that we appeared before were the.

This just takes the small remaining 28 acres and brings it into conformity with the zoning that's already approved. For these reasons, we believe there are very cogent reasons to support this application. Happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you. Do you know if Gregory and if the other speakers, they are both here, and I would. I'm sure they would like to speak. They would like to speak. All right, then we will go next to Gregory, followed by Nina or Nina. My name is Gregory Freeman. My address is 3250 West Greenway Road, unit 151. I'm the chairman of the Bell Road Business alliance. I also serve on the zoning commission where this was seen, and then we did not have quorum to approve. Mister Gilbert and his team did an extraordinary job, reaching out to our community, asking for our feedback, and then incorporating it into the design that he has brought to us. It's a huge swath of land. We're a city with many, many needs, and we, the business community, the alliance of local block watches, absolutely support this development and want to see it move forward. Thank you for your time. Thank you. We'll be welcome, Nina and then Matt. Hello, my name is Nina. I am the founder and director of Thrive Phoenix, a nonprofit organization serving the area along Bell Road from 7th Avenue to I 17. Since our inception, we have conducted 24 community cleanups, supported over 300 families with groceries and clothing, collaborated with the city to revamp the median, and are preparing to transform the parcel at the northwest corner of 7th Avenue and Bell. The progress we have made compels us to avoid leaving the property in its current state due to rezoning delays. Facilitating the rezoning process will not only open opportunities for future businesses, but also provide the families we assist with accessible employment, thereby enhancing the overall safety and well being of our neighborhood. I know the people that live there. They could use businesses to open up so they can actually walk to their jobs. I'm talking about over 300 families that are not homeless. They are on the verge of being homeless. And we, to the gentleman's point that there are no interested buyers. There was an interest buyer, and he was really close but because of the delay, he walked. And the downside about that is that we were getting ready to partner with this new buyer, and he was going to support us in our outreach efforts. It was promising. So I'm asking that we no longer delay on behalf of my families that I work with. The possibility of having businesses there and opening up an opportunity for them to walk to their jobs would be phenomenal for that neighborhood and the overall safety. Thank you. Thank you. Matt is our next speaker. Good afternoon. My name is Matthew Poole. 21 40 East Everdrive, Phoenix, Arizona, 85022. I am here as the lead pastor of Roots Community Church, speaking on behalf of our congregation in support of the rezoning effort. You might be wondering why a church would care anything about a local zoning ordinance. But we do outreach efforts multiple a year. Joining with the organization that just spoke with my wife, thrive, and on our own merits, to try to help the hurting and the needy in this area. One of the things that we have seen is that the latest census information is true. We know firsthand that the Zip code falls well below the state averages and many key indicator areas, including economic categories. And one of the areas that, unfortunately, is over the state average is the percentage of people who are living in poverty in that area. The only reason that we're here today to speak in favor of it is because we don't want the delays to impede the sale any longer, because any of that development that should have started, you know, with a buyer seven or eight months ago has now been delayed. And that has a ripple effect on the available opportunities for the people in that area. And when everyone has that same opportunity, all of us will rise. And so our initial goal is obviously spiritual development of the people in the area. But we are commanded by scripture to also meet the practical needs of those as well. And so that's kind of. That is why we're here speaking on support. So there will be, all the blockades will be removed so that the gentleman who was trying to sell it on this item. So we will close the public hearing. Thank you. For everyone who's been working hard, this is a parcel with really important history and an exciting future in district three. I just want.

Vice Mayor Stark has been working very hard on this. So I will turn to her for comments and a motion first on 79. Thank you. Thank you, mayor. And actually, I think that Mister Gilbert really set the stage. We're actually talking about 28 acres here. The vast majority of turf paradise is already zoned. And so this is a fairly small parcel of land and they have done significant outreach. And I'm pleased to see that Greg and Nina and Matt were here to speak to it tonight. I appreciate everything they do. I am a resident of 85022, so this site is particularly important to me as well.

I am currently on a leave of absence to work as an organizer with unite here local eleven. We filed complaints alleging racial disparities in pay, hiring, and promotion by SSP America, a contractor chosen by the city of Phoenix to operate at Sky Harbor Airport. Less than two months after filing the complaint, my coworker jasmine was fired. The EOD declined to investigate our complaint while the Attorney general's case is ongoing, even though Phoenix has charged EOD with an independent response responsibility to enforce Phoenix's anti discrimination laws. It is unjust that the EOD is choosing not to enforce a law to protect workers as the city intended. When will it be enough for this council to take what is happening at your airport seriously? The attorney general oversees the entire state and they've reached out and met with us. We are here today because SSP is your contractor. They are your responsibility. What message is the city of Phoenix sending when they are deferring to the state to investigate an issue with their own contractor? Do you think that all the allegations of racial disparities mean nothing? We are asking you to investigate these issues. Please put the issue of racial disparities at SSP on the agenda so that we can have a real dialogue and get to the bottom of what is happening at SSP. Thank you. Chaska is next, followed by Jasmine.

Good afternoon, mayor and city council. My name is Jasmine Glass. I was a cashier with SSP America at Sky Harbor International Airport until just a couple months ago. The last time I was here speaking to you, I informed you that we had filed complaints with the attorney general and the Phoenix Equal Opportunity Department alleging racial disparities in promotion, pay, and hiring at SSP America. Less than two months after I became a public whistleblower, I was fired from SSP. So far, at least nine outspoken union activists have been fired. We have filed charges with the federal labor board alleging that our disciplines and terminations are unlawful because SSP is applying their policies in a discriminatory way to target union supporters. The EOD declined to investigate our discrimination complaint while the AG's case is ongoing. Even though the city has charged EOD with the independent responsibility to enforce the city's anti discrimination laws. It is unjust that the EOD is choosing not to enforce the laws to protect its workers as it's supposed to. When will it be enough for this council to take what is happening at your airport seriously? The attorney general oversees the entire state, and they've reached out and met with us. Why isn't Phoenix taking this seriously? We aren't well off. Losing our jobs means dealing with being hungry and possibly homeless. Please, I asked you before to do what you can to ensure that our allegations of racial disparities are investigated. EOD's decision to not to act without taking steps to investigate is unacceptable. Please put this on the next agenda so that we can have a discussion. Show us that it matters what your contractor is doing, and hold them accountable. Thank you. Thank you. Ann Ender will be our final speaker. Thank you, Mayor Gallego and council members. Can you hear me? Okay, I'm going to read you an Instagram post that was posted last week by Chelsea Maldivon, and she has given me authorization to read this. Three years ago, I stood in front of you and pinned you as you swore in to be the most honorable and sincere police officer. I swore to always be by your side, to be your safe place, to be the place you want to come home to on good days and bad. I swore to always support you and pray for you as you headed to the streets. Earlier that month, we had celebrated our engagement, and we were preparing for our wedding soon after, where we vow to love each other for better, for worse, for richer, for poor, in sickness, in health, not knowing that our marriage would soon stand one of the greatest trials. I will always be so proud to be your wife, the wife of an honorable and sincere police officer. And that will never change. I know you signed up to serve your community and your city. I know you signed up to protect us in harm's way. I know you signed up to do your best and get the worst off the streets. I know it meant your life was at risk. But I also know it shouldn't have to be. No officer's life should have to be. You didn't sign up to be shot. And officer Diller didn't sign up to be murdered. Neither did he sign up to make his wife a widow and leave his son without a father. Neither did any officer wounded or murdered signed up to be. No one signs up for that. No one signs up to be part of a horrible story. This world is so very broken, darker than we can imagine or comprehend. It only continues to get worse. These women and men sign up to protect and serve. To be there when no one else will, to do their best so you can sleep well at night. They need us to be different, to support them, to have their backs when no one else does. To be there when evil strikes. I'm reading this to you because we have to come up with a solution to the violence against our police officers. It's unacceptable. And if our police officers don't feel safe, then how are they going to keep us safe? Thank you. We are adjourned. And I thought that's what I did as a police officer. I was there to help folks at times when it was probably the worst.", "esg_v1": [{"name": "SSP America", "insights": [{"observation": "The council charged the EOD with the independent responsibility to enforce the city's anti-discrimination laws, but the EOD is choosing not to enforce these laws to protect its workers as it was supposed to.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Allegations of racial disparities in promotion, pay, and hiring at SSP America.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "At least nine outspoken union activists have been fired from SSP America.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Charges filed with the federal labor board alleging that disciplines and terminations at SSP America are unlawful and that their policies are applied in a discriminatory way to target union supporters.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "EOD declined to investigate the discrimination complaint while the AG's case is ongoing.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "SSP America", "insights": [{"observation": "The council charged the EOD with the independent responsibility to enforce the city's anti-discrimination laws, but the EOD is choosing not to enforce these laws to protect its workers as it was supposed to.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Allegations of racial disparities in promotion, pay, and hiring at SSP America.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "At least nine outspoken union activists have been fired from SSP America.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Charges filed with the federal labor board alleging that disciplines and terminations at SSP America are unlawful and that their policies are applied in a discriminatory way to target union supporters.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "EOD declined to investigate the discrimination complaint while the AG's case is ongoing.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 2749268, "chunk_end_time": 3083774, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz6B6Ac9s7M", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz6B6Ac9s7M&t=2749s"}], "date": "03/04/2024", "meeting_name": "Council Formal Meeting"}, {"chunks": [{"start": 0, "end": 5000, "text": "Good afternoon.

Item 104 is related to the central station naming, and it is an item brought forward to name it for Greg Stanton. Nearly a decade ago, Mayor Greg Stanton decided that when it came to transit, it was time to go big.

A $32 billion plan to improve our transit system. Transit 2050, which was proposition 104 on the ballot, secured our transit funding base until the year 2050.

Since entering public office, improving local bus service, paratransit and the formation of high capacity transit have been top of mind for Greg Stanton. I am proud to support the naming of the Central Station redevelopment project planned for 300 north central Avenue for the Greg Stanton Central station, and I'm excited to recognize his service. He has also been a longtime advocate for our downtown, and this is a project that helps improve and connect our downtown. We are recommending we follow a similar process to the one we used at the City of Phoenix when naming the most recent terminal for Senator John McCain, which would send that recommendation to the Heritage Commission for review and recommendation. Greg's vision has improved multiple modes of transportation citywide, including bus, light rail, paratransit streets, bike lanes and active transportation. When Central Station is operational next year, it will provide important connectivity and trips, including half a dozen local bus routes. It will also provide access to the dash circulator a designated space for dial ride paratransit service, multiple rapid and express boots and bus routes, and an ASU inter campus shuttle. Light rail service will be augmented with the opening of the South Central Light rail station, which will extend service to Central and baseline. The Greg Santon Central Station will not only serve as a major transit hub for the community, but will stand as the city's primary downtown bus and light rail transit center. This is one of multiple transit centers we have named, most recently for Thelda Williams, who served as both councilwoman and mayor, and in addition to the Ed Pastor Transit center at Central and Broadway, which is an operating transit center with beautiful historic building and tens of art. It will continue to remain a transit center unless this council decides otherwise, and I think we have no intention of doing that. We want to grow the importance of the light rail and open and expand more activities today is about honoring some of the people who today is about honoring an individual who has helped improve the city and our transit system. Greg Stanton was an excellent mayor whose leadership improved the lives of those who live there and I believe it is exciting and great opportunity to honor him and his legacy. We'll next go for a motion mayor I move to request that staff start the process for the Heritage commission to review naming the Transit Central Station center after Greg Stanton and to come back to the city council with a recommendation. I have additional comments after the motion receives a second. Mayor we have a motion. Do we have a second? 2nd we have a motion. In 2 seconds we'll recognize. I think I heard Councilman Robinson first and I'll go back to Councilman O'Brien for comments. Thank you so much. I am excited to make the motion to honor former mayor and current congressman Greg Stanton with a request to the Heritage commission to consider naming the new central station the Greg Stanton Central station. Although I am on the other side of the political aisle from my friend, many of the actions congressman Stanton took as mayor are things we do see eye to eye on, his support for public safety, his dedication to our parks and preserves, and his understanding of the needed revenue streams for future city needs and growth. I value all the groundwork he laid during his time as mayor and as a council member in Phoenix that led to the building blocks like investing in biosciences, which has created the vibrant and innovative stretch of 7th street from Roosevelt to Van Buren, and focusing on increasing the trade between Mexico and Phoenix. By helping to open the first trade office in Hermosillo, Mexico, this council is able to build off of those building blocks and continue making America's fifth largest city successful. As mayor, Congressman Stanton was strong supporter of public transit and led the effort to help create the T 2050 plan, which lays out the valley's public transit system for the coming decades. It only seems fitting that council honor former mayor Stanton by naming the upcoming central hub, the first transit center to feature the light rail and bus station bus connection. The Gregg Stanton Central station. Thank you, mayor. Thank you, vice mayor. Thank you, mayor. I support this, and I will tell you why. I was at the Thelda Williams grand opening, and Greg spoke, and I was quite moved by what he had to say. And it reminded me that he has done just as much as Theoda has done for light rail. He's had a strong commitment, and he still has it in Congress. He's always trying to help us with funding, and I think we should honor all of our mayors for some of the great things they've done. And this is probably one that stood out for Mayor Stanton. I am very supportive of the idea, and I hope that we pursue looking at other, whether it's a park or another light rail station for some of our former mayors who've done so much for our city.

Thank you. Thank you. Councilman waring, at John McCain's memorial service at the national cathedral, Barack Obama got up and said, you know, John always did have a sense of humor, and he's having a joke right now by making George Bush and me stand up here and say nice things about him. I like that line, actually. And being Republican, I don't know that I've ever quoted Barack Obama. So there's a first time for everything. But I was thinking about that quote last week when the mayor and Suskoff Moroffice handed me a letter saying of wonderful things about light rail. So anybody who knows anything about me thought that might be out of pocket for me to sign, but I was happy to do it for former mayor Stanton. I thought this is a very worthy honor for him. Just a couple quick things. By the time I'm done, I've been on this council for about 15 and a half years, which will be a quarter of my lifespan at that point. Greg's a year or two younger than me, and I think he's done at least 16 years. So he'll have spent a quarter of his life plus, obviously, his other public service in support of the city. He always worked hard. He was always fair with me and a gentleman. I thought he was a very good public servant, even if on some issues like light rail, I might disagree. And I definitely thought this was a worthy honor for him, for what has really been for him, you know, pretty much a lifetime of service for Phoenicians. And I thought that should be respected, I guess, across party aisle. I didn't think that was a factor. I definitely thought this was something that he had earned through really hard work, and it was a worthy acknowledgement of his efforts. And I appreciate you bringing that forward. Mayor thank you, Councilman Robinson. Mayor thank you very much. You know, I support this particular motion also because I think Congressman Stanton truly is deserving of this honor. I had the opportunity to work with Greg going back to the well, when he was first in office as a city council person in district six, I was with the police department. And the one thing that I think is most important that has always stood out about Greg is that he always considered what was best for the community. He was always about the community. It was always about not just the community and the residents in district six, but in Phoenix as a whole. And what we have seen since his time in Congress is that same heartfelt desire to do the right things for the right reasons. You know, for all of these reasons and for all the years I've known him, I just think it is the right thing to do at the right moment at the right location. So I fully support this motion. Mayor, thank you very much. Thank you, Councilwoman. Pastor I like to acknowledge the mayor, council members, staff, and most importantly, the residents of the city of Phoenix. History has shown that naming of a building, monuments or streets has its fair share of controversy. Recently, prior, city of Phoenix council members and the mayor changed the name of Squaw Peak to Palestua Peak to honor the memory of a fallen Arizona soldier, and it was the right action to take. Today we are discussing the naming of a significant economic development hub. I believe it is an immense honor to name a government owned building for, for individuals from our community who are admired and who have made an everlasting impact and lives of many to share a brief journey through history. Ed Pastor was the first Mexican American elected to represent the state of Arizona and Congress beginning in 1991. He is also my father. While the congressman was known to be a workhorse, not a show horse, he was also one of the most prolific members of Congress to bring resources to his community and to the state. This is a fact and one that is important to remember. The congressman brought billions of dollars to Arizona and to the city of Phoenix through public transportation projects such as the light rail. Light rail was one system that connected communities and transformed the trajectory of economic development in Phoenix, Tempe and Mesa. Before light rail workers in my workers in my district and in other districts felt left out of a cultural renaissance and a development in downtown Phoenix, light rail changed all of that. Light rail and bus systems are not simply lines that run from point a to point b. You see, these transportation systems are economic development pieces, connectors of communities which Congressman Pasteur led. They changed the lives of many Phoenicians. To recognize Congressman Pasteur's efforts in this arena, the city named South Phoenix Transportation hub in his name. For years, Latinos, especially our young people who are of latino descent, had the opportunity to see one of their own community members honored for his work in bringing more resources to our city. Today begins the process and recommendation to name the new central station. Absent a congressman pastor, I am here not as a daughter, but as a person who wants to make sure that history is not forgotten.

Absent a congressman pastor, I am here not as a daughter, but as a person who wants to make sure that history is not forgotten. Just like the naming of Barry Goldwater, John McCain and Lincoln Ragsdale will not be forgotten. As documented, the current Ed pastor bus station hub will be repurposed. An RFP will be issued with the intent to add housing and the intent of housing and the building to be blended. My contention is that the new transportation facility, a hub for both light rail and business systems, should have the name of Ed Pastor to carry the history and to preserve it. Some say that this matter is trivia. Some say there's already too many buildings named after him. I say that history is never trivial, especially history that resulted in a dramatic shift in our city's economic development and community connection through the advocacy, lobbying, and putting in countless of hours of work by Congressman pastor in order to bring resources to our city. I have several questions, but I can wait. Mayor. Councilman Guardado. Thank you, mayor. I would like to make a substitute motion to start the process for the heritage commission to review naming the transit center after Congressman her pastor or Congressman Greg Stanton to come back to city council with a recommendation. Second. We have a motion and a second. We'll go to public comment now. Sonia Gomez, followed by Mary Durand. Nope, not there. And do we have Mary? Do we? Mary Rose Wilcox. All right. Brian Fernandez. Thank you so much, mayor and council. Very nice to speak before your day. I'm Brian Fernandez, and until the voters decide to kick me out, I represent southwestern Arizona and the Arizona Senate. I just want to speak today on this particular issue. I would like just to talk for one moment about Ed Pastor and the influence he's had on so many people throughout Arizona. He is someone that I would not be here personally without him. And I know my mother who preceded me, and she's now head of USDA Arizona would not be where she is either. Ed pastor inspired, inspired so many. One thing that I. Greg Stanton's an old family friend, and I very much appreciate everything that he's done and really count him as one of my dear friends. Ed pastor was on appropriations his first term, which is anyone that knows about Congress is unheard of. No one ever gets on appropriations first term. Congressman Stanton, I believe, is in his fourth term and may get it next year. He did that by building coalitions amongst many people. And even once he was on appropriations, he built coalitions to bring so much to Arizona. I mean, we see it here in Phoenix, but we've also see it throughout Arizona. I just, me personally and the people that elect me would very much like to see Ed Pastor be named, or the, believe me, named for him. And I did submit a letter for the record, signed by several legislators. I just found out about this earlier today, but I talked to a few people and we signed the letter. And so you have that, and hopefully it'll be on record. Thank you so much. And it's so great to see so many friends on council. Thank you. Petra Falcone is next, followed by Sonia pastor. Well, good afternoon, mayor and council, and thank you for this opportunity to speak today. And I know there's a two minute limit. I first want to thank each and every one of you for your public service, because that's what I think we're doing here today. It's honoring not only Ed pastor, but also Congressman Stanton, which today is not about not letting Greg Stanton get his time in the limelight. But what we are doing is really preserving the history and the narrative of this state. And as Councilman Laura Pastor said, he was our first latino in the state of Arizona to be elected to Congress now. But the point I want to make is that we are honoring Congressman pastor for his legacy, for his gifts, not only to Maricopa county, but to Yuma county and to Pima county and probably other areas that I don't know about. I first encountered Yuma county and with Congress and pastor out there working with farm workers, and they have the best funded military, best in Yuma county because of Congressman pastor and multiple other projects in Yuma county. So the point that I want to make today is that when my children grow up and my grandchildren grow up, I want them to, I want all of us to be able to point to buildings that recognize the service, the public service, and sacrifice of public life leaders like yourselves. And I would hope that one day you all want to be in that situation and not want to have it displaced by somebody else's request. We found out yesterday that this item was going to be added to the bottom of the agenda today. And thank you for moving it up forward, mayor and council, because I do think we need to give it its time today. But again, I just want each and every one of you to remember that one day you will be in the same situation where you want your community to recognize your public service. And that's why we're here today.

So the point that I want to make today is that when my children grow up and my grandchildren grow up, I want them to, I want all of us to be able to point to buildings that recognize the service, the public service, and sacrifice of public life leaders like yourselves. And I would hope that one day you all want to be in that situation and not want to have it displaced by somebody else's request. We found out yesterday that this item was going to be added to the bottom of the agenda today. And thank you for moving it up forward, mayor and council, because I do think we need to give it its time today. But again, I just want each and every one of you to remember that one day you will be in the same situation where you want your community to recognize your public service. And that's why we're here today. We want Congressman pastor's life and legacy to be preserved so that all your future children, all future citizens of the city of Phoenix will recognize him. Thank you. Thank you. Sonia Pastor is next, followed by Tiffany Pestor. Good afternoon. Thank you, mayor and city council. I'm going to try and make this as brief as I can because I know I have a time limit, obviously. My name is Sonia Pastor. The congressman is my uncle, Laura Pastor is my cousin, and Congressman Greg Stanton is a very good friend of mine. He, in fact, gave a tour of the Capitol in Washington, DC last week for my son and my nephew. My comments are not about Greg Stanton. As I stated, he is a friend and obviously he is a very accomplished member of Congress and he has done great things for our community. This is about preserving the history of a great man, a man who ensured that we had transit services in the city. The reason why we have light rail is because of Congressman pastor. What I have not mentioned is that prior to my current career, I worked for Valley Metro. I was a consultant and I was responsible for assisting with the outreach for the light rail extension in South Phoenix. And cat by ten, working with the former CEO of Valley Metro, the city manager, Mario Poniagua, Maria Hyatt, who is now retired, and several other individuals in the city of Phoenix. We came to the conclusion and made a recommendation to extend the light rail to downtown and then to cap I ten. Included in those discussions was the fact that the central station in south Phoenix would, its purpose would have to change and therefore the former CEO, along with city staff, recommended that the Central City light rail station would become the Ed pastor station in preservation of central City. I recall this because we had several conversations and city staff was very concerned because this included federal funding. What I ask is that you continue this motion and you offer stakeholders the appropriate opportunity to participate in this conversation. Thank you. Tiffany pastor is followed by Robert Pastor. Good afternoon, council and mayor. I have the good fortune to have married my husband, Robert Pastor. My given name is Tiffany Lucero. I'm an Arizona native, and I have witnessed firsthand what the congressman Ed pastor and what the congressman Greg Stanton have done for this state and for this community. They both deserve recognition. The method in which that I have even just heard here today, by which the current building is being sought to be named, I think creates a basis for pause. And I think that there needs to be some pause to investigate how we got here and to remember our history and remember what work was done not just by Congressman pastor, but by Congressman pastor in conjunction with Mayor Greg Stanton. I think it's important not to act hastily. I think it's important to pause. That is all. Robert Pastor is next, followed by Verma pastor. Good afternoon, mayor, council. My name is Robert Pastor. I'm a lawyer with the law firm Montoya, Lucero and pastor. And I'm here really for my aunt, my aunt Verma. And she's here because with her husband, they dedicated their lives to improving this community, to serving the people of Arizona. Our family's been in this part of the country since the 1860s, and I have seen lots of new people come to town, plant their flag, and say, we're going to create change. We're going to make a difference. And everyone can get their chance, and they can do that. But I want to make sure that this council preserves history, because my uncle, his brother, others like Danny Ortega, Ronnie Lopez, they started a movement in the seventies to give voice to Latinos, to make sure that we were heard. And today that movement continues. Right? We're not just farmworkers and cooks and people who clean people's houses. We are doctors. We are lawyers. We are congressmen. I want my children to be raised in this city, and I want them to go and see buildings and say, hey, that's a brown boy, just like me. He made a difference, like my wife just said. I think we need to kind of look a little more closely about how we got here and why we're here, how this came to be. This is not. Greg Stanton is a wonderful human being. He continues to do wonderful work for this city, for the people of Arizona. I'm concerned that instead of acknowledging history, we're trying to rewrite it, because we know that when this light rail was planned, it was planned on a big scale. And we know that some buildings were going to become obsolete as the city, we continued to grow. So I'm going to ask you to please, like my wife said, take a pause. Let's look at the facts, and let's make sure we preserve history, not alternative facts. Verma pastor is next, followed by Raina. How are you? Good to see you. Thank you. Mayor Gallego and Phoenix City council. I am Verma pastor, wife of the late Congressman Ed Pasol.

Mayor Gallego and Phoenix City council. I am Verma pastor, wife of the late Congressman Ed Pasol. As you know, the congressman was instrumental in securing federal funding for Maricopa county and the city of Phoenix for bus and light rail projects. This journey started as early as in the 1990s with the congressman securing funding until the city received a full funding grant agreement from the federal Transit Agency in 205. So there were a lot of years in between the way he provided the funding. The congressman continued to support the city and county in bringing to fruition three key transportation initiatives resulting in the Phoenix 2000 plan in 2015. Ed's allegiancy to the city and to this project continued post retirement from Congress as he served as the first chair of the city Transportation Commission, which led the way to the 2050 plan. Along this journey, several of you in the community, including elected officials, staff and committee members, have personally stated to me the plan to move the congressman name from the transit agency at south central location to the central location as eventually the south central location will be shuttered. I understand and appreciate congressman work in Congress and as mayor because he as a congressman worked in tandem. However, Ed was instrumental in securing the initial federal dollars, close to half a billion. According to actual House committee appropriation reports, from 1999 to 2014, the congressman solidified $425.5 million for light rail and an additional $56 million for busing projects. Thank you. And I humbly ask you to include Congressman Etwa source name for consideration naming the transit center to the heritage Commission. Thank you. Thank you. Raina is next, followed by Ricardo. Thank you, city council for members. I'm not a politician and I don't like it to be. And the way to be learning things and the way I be learning today. I'm at first born in my family as a Mexican. I come into this country and I love the process. One of the things I be learning when I became a citizen that was a pastor teaching our children so many things, he came into our school, he coming to our communities and recognized people like him is very big for our community. As a first voting, one of the things I also learned is the due process. And I think so in here, the due process is not working in the right way because as a in this country, in this community, in this city, I never learned about this issue until today. And this is why I was in my doctor appointment and I coming over here because for me, it's not fair to don't let the community know what is happening. And I don't say Stanton is not right person. He's amazing man, but I think so legacy and here and the work for the men he was working for many, many years to bring to this city so many farms. It's not right what they doing here right now. Thank you, and I do appreciate it. To have the consideration, to have our community to come in and speak up in this issue not coming and pass by like always, please. This is not an issue. They need to be a big hug for the next person because this is coming. We need to have consideration in our community. And I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Ricardo is next. Hello, everyone. My name is Ricardo. I'm a resident of West Phoenix, and I'm here today to oppose this because I believe that it is wrong for us to take a transit center which is going to be at the heart of our city, which, as was mentioned earlier, is being redeveloped and is going to be improved, and for it to not use to honor Congressman Ed pastor, who really, the whole reason why we have light rail is because of him. And so I think it's a mistake, and I think some of the folks on the council may not have understood how much of really a slap in the face this is to Chicanos here in Phoenix. When you make this type of proposal again, I want to reiterate what a lot of people said here. This isn't about Greg Stanton. I am a supporter of Congressman Greg Stanton. I will continue to support Greg Stanton. And if there's another transit center that is going to be named after him, I'll be happy to support that as well. But I think this particular transit center, like we heard before, was understood to be named after Ed pastor. And for those of you that don't know, I've spent some time working here at city council, and through my conversations with staff, it was understood that this was going to be named Ed Pastor Transit center. So the fact that it's being changed now, that is why I consider this a slap in the face to our chicano history here. And so I want to caution our council members before they make the decision to vote in favor of this. Just what type of impact and what that says to Chicanos here in Phoenix. Keep that in mind. Thank you. Thank you. That concludes public comment. Vice mayor, can I. I guess I'm confused because we have an ed pastor transit center, and I did not realize there's discussion of changing it or closing it down. Could I get confirmation on that? And then the discussion of naming this particular station after Congressman passed over, I don't recall us ever being briefed on that. Maybe I wasn't briefed, but I don't remember.

And then the discussion of naming this particular station after Congressman passed over, I don't recall us ever being briefed on that. Maybe I wasn't briefed, but I don't remember. But what's happening right now with the current transit center. Thank you, mayor, members of the council, I'm Mario Poniagua, deputy city manager. And just to give some insight on the current transit center, and along with me here is Jesus Sapien, the public transit director. So the current Ed pastor transit center at Central and Broadway Road. Thank you. Has been a transit center for several years. And however, there have been changes along the way with the transit system. And so there have been some discussions about potentially looking at reusing potential reuses for that site, potentially redeveloping, but nothing formal has happened with that. There's been no formal action on any of those discussions. It's mainly been informal discussions happening about potentially reusing that site because the site isn't the busy transit center that it once was, but it currently is pastoral transit center and functions that way today. But it's not quite the same as it once was. And I would just look to Jesus to, if you would add anything that I might have not included in my comments. Mayor, members of council, I think Mario summarized it correctly. It is a transit center today and operates as it has for, I believe, over 20 years as a transit center center. But Mario's correct. Years ago, we had more routes in there, so we had a little bit more activity. However, under t 2050, as previously discussed, we have expanded service and the footprint of, you know, the geography of that we cover. So we don't have as many routes terminating there, but we do have transit service adjacent to it. We have two local routes, a rapid route, and, of course, a central light rail platform being constructed literally across the street. So it's still active, just not at the level it was 20 years ago when it was first built. Sorry. But given that light rail is coming to South Phoenix, isn't there a potential to kind of reimagine that, maybe add a bike hub, do some things to really compliment what's already there? Mayor, members of the council, Vice Mayor Stark. Yes. We, as Mario mentioned earlier, we've had conversations about potential options for reimagining that site, but nothing's been solidified. No RFP has been issued today. Well, I, as one would love to explore that, and I don't think that that would take away from the legacy of Congressman Pasteur. If we reimagine it and make it only better. I am aware that we have a transit center named after him, and so I think it's now time to honor Greg Stanton. Thank you, mayor. Thank you, Councilwoman O'Brien. Thank you. So I just want to go over to make sure I understood the answers to vice mayor's questions. So there are no definitive plans to shutter or take down the current Ed pastor transit center? That's correct. So whatever plans for the future have not been decided, and we absolutely could keep that asset and improve it and make it better than it is today. Is that correct? That's correct. Any discussions have just been informal discussions, but nothing official and nothing that's been through the council. Okay. Additionally, a couple of the speakers today brought up, and I think including my colleague, councilman pastor, brought up that these discussions about naming central station after Congressman Pasteur have been going on for years. And so I'm going to say that this is the first time, and while I realize I'm gonna say one of the newer, not the newest, but one of the newer council members, I've never heard about the central station being named after former congressman pastor. So that is news to me. But I appreciate you answering my questions. We are spending 50 million or so as a region to enhance ticketing. We are pushing hard for people to go to ticketing on their mobile phones. Every transit center has less activity, is that right? And will continue at an elevated level. Mayor, members of the council? Yes. The expectation is that with the newer options that we are doing under the new regional fare collection system that City of Phoenix has been undertaking jointly with Valley Metro, that there would be basically less cash collection at transit centers. And so members of the writing public would instead use reloadable fare cards and an app on their phone. Thank you. Councilwoman pastor? Yes. I would like to know what you have told the community regarding, because there's community members regarding the current plan for South Central, and it was a plan that we voted on, and communities showed up and said, we do not want this to, to be changed. The second piece is I would like Chris Mackey to come up to the table to discuss the fact of what we voted on to send that property to the FTA, to be able to ask if we could repurpose that property and the intent and the writing that went into it of what's really going to happen. So, first of all, what did you promise South Phoenix constituents that central and Van Buren was supposed to be transferred, the name of Ed pastor on Central and Broadway was supposed to be transferred to Central and Van Buren?

And so members of the writing public would instead use reloadable fare cards and an app on their phone. Thank you. Councilwoman pastor? Yes. I would like to know what you have told the community regarding, because there's community members regarding the current plan for South Central, and it was a plan that we voted on, and communities showed up and said, we do not want this to, to be changed. The second piece is I would like Chris Mackey to come up to the table to discuss the fact of what we voted on to send that property to the FTA, to be able to ask if we could repurpose that property and the intent and the writing that went into it of what's really going to happen. So, first of all, what did you promise South Phoenix constituents that central and Van Buren was supposed to be transferred, the name of Ed pastor on Central and Broadway was supposed to be transferred to Central and Van Buren? I did not ask for it. I was told by staff and community that that was going to happen. And those conversations were with the south central collaborative along with the artists that toured that space. So I want to get real and frank and quit dancing around the questions. Thank you, Mayor and councilwoman pastor, there have been informal discussions with you and others about potentially moving the name of the Ed Pastor transit center from where it is today to Central Station. And I do acknowledge that that's something that we have talked about in the past. But obviously that's a council decision. There's a process for that needs to go through the Heritage commission and ultimately is decided upon by the council. So anyway, any discussions about that have been purely informal discussions and with acknowledgement that that is a council, a city council decision, that's not something that any staff member can promise would happen. It's only the city council that can decide that. I understand that the city council can decide that. However, there is a process to go through with the heritage peace, so I'm just putting that down. If anybody read the process and the heritage process, we're doing this a little backwards. But I asked Chris Mackey to come to the table because I know under Councilwoman Ansari and others and that were part of meeting with the South Central collective for several years, three years at least, discussing what was going to happen to that space. And we voted on in subcommittee and council for that site to be disposal. And that site was included in the 24 25 list sent to the FTA. The intent of that is to write, and there's two rfps that have been discussed. One was to activate the building where the Ed pastor name is centered right now. To activate that building. It came from community. Staff met with community and told them, we are going to write an RFP so that we can activate this space simultaneously. We will be writing an RFP to re look at what this space is going to look like. That could be affordable housing, mixed housing. The building will be saved, but it will be blended with the project. I don't know if I'm correct, I'm wrong, or I'm smoking dope. Mayor Kenzlewood. Pastor, if I could take just a moment to kind of walk through the process that we've done on the site so far. You're absolutely correct. Former council member Nsari did bring groups together on a number of occasions to talk about and reimagine the site. It was her guidance in the year before she left that we work with transit. We'd been out to tour the site together to consider moving forward with a request for proposal on the site in our 24 25 list of properties that economic development would propose to get ready to take out for request for proposal. We did bring it to the subcommittee. It was on our list. That is just the broad stroke of starting the process that's making sure that council doesn't have any issues with some of the properties that we're considering taking out. It could be taken out in 24. It could be taken out taken out in 25, 26. That just starts the process. Mister Sapien and I then to even go any farther, would have to write a scope of work that the council would authorize. Then we'd have to visit with the FTA since there are financial partners. Jump in. If I say this wrong, that we would have to take it to the FTA to gain their concurrence that they would allow for either additional development or redevelopment to happen on the site. We then come before subcommittee with staff scope of work for a recommendation for an RFP. We then come to the formal council for that recommendation. We would then open an RFP and see what type of responses we have. At this time, we don't have council's formal authorization, nor have we requested it to go out for an RFP. It's been community meetings with former councilman Ansari and on the subcommittee we did take forward. Each year we take forward a full list of items that we may propose to take out for RFP in the, in the coming year. Mister Sapien, did I say that correctly? Yes, you did. And mayor, members of the council, Chris is correct. We do have a federal interest in the Ed pastor transit center property. We did receive federal funds a little over 20 years ago for the land acquisition and for the construction of the site. So anything we did relative to council's approval, such as taking out an RFP for redeveloping the site. Number one, we can put all our wishes and desires in there as to, you know, retention of the site, the building that's there, as councilwoman pastor correctly called out. But secondly, we would have to, just like we did with Central Station, get FTA approval and walk them through what, if anything, we're going to do to the site. And we wouldn't, you know, there wouldn't be shovels in the ground basically until we got FTA approval. But that would be one of the components of issuing an RFP is getting FTA approval. Thank you.

And we have a great record of using this process to actually enhance sites. So, for example, we have also gone to the FTA with an RFP for Central Station, and it has created more amenities. So it's, I think, made it even more desirable. Councilwoman Hodgewashington. Thank you, mayor. I just wanted to clarify, make sure it's a lot of moving parts at the moment. I just want to make sure I understand the current status of everything at this juncture. At this juncture, has an RFP been issued regarding the current property that houses the Ed pastor transit center? Mayor? Councilman Hodge, Washington, no, we've not come to seek council's authorization, formal authorization on a specific RFP. We have concurrence from the subcommittee that it's on a future list. Okay. That's what I wanted to clarify because I heard what seemed to be conflicting information. I just want to make sure I confirm that. Like Councilwoman O'Brien, this is, in the recent day, is the first time I've heard that this was a consideration to name it after Ed pastor, the central station. So I'm just trying to also identify some information on the extent of the community meetings that may have been conducted to get this feedback. Is there anything you can add for that? For me? You said they were conducted with Councilwoman Ansari's office. I'm just trying to get some more information as to maybe time. How did we determine the stakeholders just who had input into this conversation and what was the, at the end of that meeting? What was the conclusion? Mayor and Councillor Woman Hodge, Washington yeah, there were some community meetings that were facilitated by Councilwoman Ansari's office, along with Councilwoman pastor, with members of the community in south central, specifically to talk about potential uses of the Ed pastor transit center site at Central and Broadway. And so really the stakeholders were joint effort of the two council offices bringing those two groups together to talk about, again, the potential reuses of that site and what could be done there. And so I think that's the extent. Is there anything else that you would add? Chris Mackey? Mayor? Councilman Hodge, Washington no, those were the meetings we met on site, walk through the building with the community to gain some insight into what they envisioned for the potential adaptive reuse of the building. And if, I just want to make sure I understand this very clearly that if and until the council says otherwise, the Ed pastor transit center would remain in its current operational state. Mayor, members of the council, that is correct. So thank you so much. Mayor thank you. So we will, I think, first have a roll call on Councilman Guardado's. No, councilman pastor's motion. Guardado Guardado's motion. And then if that does not succeed, we would then go to the original motion. Is that right, Denise? Yes, Mayor all right, roll call. Galinde Elvida Guardado. Mayor, can I explain my vote? Please do. Thank you. I think that given the conversation that we've had here today day, commitments that have been made to the community, I think that, you know, we have two different congressmen who have done a lot for this community when it comes to transportation. I'm hopeful that this motion will move forward so that we can have a more robust conversation at the commission and that we can figure out who the center will be named after. And hopefully we will give that opportunity to the community so that they can come together and also be able to weigh in on the decision that we will, at the end, will be making. I will be voting yes Hodge, Washington I, too, would like to explain my vote. Mayor please do. Thank you. I do believe that both individuals are duly deserving of the honor. I believe that Greg Standon has made an impeccable mark in our community when it comes to transportation. We often hear the story of how he relied personally on public transportation. This is not to demonize the legacy of Mister Ed pastor as well. I do believe that he has made great strides, and it's a key figure in a latino culture here in Arizona that we want to definitely respect and honor. I'm going to vote no on the substitute motions because it's abundantly clear from what I've heard that, that the Ed pastor transit center is going to remain until council says otherwise. And I don't believe that council is at the position where they're going to say no to or they're going to modify the Ed pastor transit center. O'Brien, may I explain my vote? Mayor please do. I also will be voting no on the substitute motion. I think that it is time to honor Congressman Stanton for his contributions as well. And I believe that we should look at if it's either leaving reimagining, making the current transit center a better place. There is that center. And so I'd like to work with council on ensuring that that continues and becomes a great legacy for Ed pastor. Thank you. Pastor, I would like to explain my vote. Please do.

I believe the council doesn't have the full information in front of you and are making a decision that the community asked for. And once again, the community is shut out of some of the decision making. Conversations were had, conversations were told and said artists were there. The south central collective was there. And that discussion has been happening. But if we want to reimagine this center we can but what I'm telling you in the 2050 in the transit piece it is very clear of the discussions and I will get the dialogue and minutes so that every one of you understand what has been happening for the last six years. I will be voting yes. Robinson waring I'd like to explain my vote, please do you know, as I said earlier, I was presented with the opportunity to sign the letter and I thought that was an appropriate and worthy honor for someone, even if I disagree with him sometimes. A worthy honor for somebody who has worked very hard and given a large chunk of his life to the city. I thought that was appropriate and I said an immediate yes and I was proud to do it. But that is no reflection on what I think of the past story misses Pastor I think you know that I enjoyed talking to your husband more than maybe no offense guys any other elected officials I've dealt with. I enjoyed him thoroughly as a person, as someone to work with. Enjoyed him very much. You know, I guess I would just say this is certainly not a reflection of what I think about him and if you have some other suggestions of what would be a worthy honor for him, I can only speak for myself. I certainly would entertain them. So I made this commitment. I'm not going to back off that but I would certainly welcome any opportunity to honor Ed Pastor's service and would be interested, as Laura said, what the community would think would be appropriate. Thank you. And I'm voting yes or no. Excuse me stark if I can explain my vote. We have a ed Pesfra transit center and it sounds like there is a vision to make it bigger and even better and so I will vote no because I think we also need to honor Greg Stanton Gallego no fails. Two to six. We are now back on the original motion. Wonderful. Thank you. And I think important to clarify Greg Stanton did not ask for the station to be named for him. So I think it was a surprise to him. Roll call on the original motion Galindo Guardado can we calhind Alviro Mayor, may I explain my vote? Please do. I'm sorry I have a severe cold and not feeling well so I'll be as precise and concise as possible. Mayor, I have and maintain the highest respect for the late Congressman Ed pastor and his long legacy of service to community. His strong support for the city of Phoenix transit system is without dispute. Ed cared for Arizona. He was a product of the copper corridor. For the sake of clarity, at no time was there a conversation or decision made to demolish, repurpose the site with affordable housing or to close the historic site of the Ed pastor transition station on Broadway and Central, located in district seven. This information is both unfounded and unfortunate. I am committed and dedicated to ensuring that this center serves as a heart and is a continued location for transit and hopefully soon, soon a go to center for resources to assist the community and the neighborhoods located around it. But because my employer was contacted regarding this issue, it now becomes necessary to remove any potential for irregularity. And for that reason, I abstain from this vote. Guardado? Mayor, can I explain my vote? Please do. Thank you. As much as I, I admire the work that Congressman Stanton has done, I think there's a lot of great work still ahead of us. I thank him for his leadership and for all of the hard work that he's been doing. But I still do believe that we bypassed what the community really wanted to happen in this station. So I will be voting no. Hodge Washington. Yes. O'Brien. Yes. Pastor. No. Robinson. Yes. Waring Stark. Yes. Gallego. Yes. Passes seven two.

Councilwoman Hodge, Washington. Thank you, mayor, for the. Thank you, mayor. Exactly two weeks ago, we voted on a last minute amendment that. Well, first off, let me move to adopt item 63. Sorry, item. Move to reconsider as outlined in my letter dated May 8, 2024. 2nd motion and a second. We'll recognize the councilwoman Hodge Washington for additional comments. Thank you, your honor. Thank you, mayor. Exactly two weeks ago, we voted on a last minute amendment that would forever bar individuals who had filed certain claims against the Phoenix Police Department from serving on the citizens Review board. We engaged in a robust discussion on the dais. We heard the need to ensure that all civilian votes were considered, including those who had filed claims against the police department, and we also considered whether those without a state law enforcement experience should be eligible. It was reiterated during those conversations that this system, the civilian review Board, should be a trusted place for concerns without any appearance of bias and propriety and the need to ensure that the information was equally shared amongst the board members. Although a vote proceeded, I continue to believe that the decision warranted further consideration, and I made no secret about my intent to bring this issue back to you for reconsideration. Before doing so, I reviewed the ordinance language from 18 other jurisdictions that we as a council were provided with. As example. I looked to see what the other jurisdictions were doing and pulled excerpts based on the concerns I heard from you council members on May 1, 2024, I urge you to reconsider and allow a vote on the proposed changes in addition to section 2014, a one as outlined in my 820 24 letter. Thank you, mayor. Thank you. We have a motion and a second. Any discussion. Roll call. Galindo. Yes. Guardado. Yes. Hodge, Washington. Yes. O'Brien. Yes. Pastor Robinson. Mayor, may I explain my vote? Please do. Thank you. I think compromise is important in all these situations, and I still have a difficult time with not allowing someone with law enforcement experience as a voting member on the board who could provide that background, that experience. Yet we will allow somebody who may. And granted, it could be ten years out. But I always worry about how long someone could hold onto something. And I get it. I want to compromise. I want to look for a way to move this whole thing forward and do the right things. But I think fair is fair. And I think if we're going to not consider someone with a law enforcement background, not necessarily from the Phoenix police Department or anything like that, if we're going to leave that out, I'm going to have to vote no no on this one. Thank you, Mayor Waring. Stark. Yes. Galliego. Yes. Passes seven two. The motion to reconsider has passed, which means we now go to item 63. Would the clerk read the title? Item 63 is for ordinance g 7258, an ordinance relating to the office of Accountability and Transparency, amending chapter 20, article one, section 21 of the Phoenix City Code, article two, sections 25 through 2010 and 2013, and repealing and deleting sections 2011 in its entirety, adding article three, sections 2014 through 2017 and amending article four, sections 2026. Nicely done. Do you want to introduce the item? I can go ahead and make the motion. Wonderful. Go ahead. Councilwoman, I move to adopt item 63 with the amendments as noted in my May 8, 2024 memo. Second motion. And a second. Any comments before we go to public? Comments? Ben Loughlin. All right. We have no Ben Loughlin, so we will go, I think, to Councilwoman Hodge, Washington. Thank you, mayor. As I stated when I asked for reconsideration, I believe that this draft language addresses issues that were raised by this council in the dais. And I think it's a reasonable balance of. It's a reasonable balance and compromise for this council, and it ensures that the. That all voices. We are a civilian review board, is inclusive and not strives to be exclusive. So with that, I ask my colleagues to support this motion. Thank you. Okay. Yes. Guardado. Yes. Hodge Washington. Yes.

I'm opposed to this. My community was not told about this. I just found out about this and left a volunteer luncheon to come. I've been on the phone with other people and other block watches like Palo Verde. Blockwatch who. Who had come to a community meeting to talk with the owner about not wanting a storage facility at this place. They did not know either. I've been texting with other people who were against this that they can't come here because they have work today and they didn't know either. A storage unit is not good in that area. I've talked with business owners multiple times. I know this has been brought up at city council meetings, planning and commission. There are so many businesses in that area being affected by homeless problems. I mean, I could go on and on for it. There is a street issue, too, where there is a community of single mothers that live in housing development there. There's kids that play in the street. We had talks with the owner multiple times. I asked about, you know, street safety. What could that be done? There was nothing that he said could be done on that. The owner of the property said he wanted to work with the community. This is not working with the community when we get blindsided. And I have people saying, I didn't know that this was coming up. I would have loved to do a public comment because it affects them. The storage unit place that was put in next to them, they told me that it affected their community very badly and they have an increase in crime and they didn't want this to happen again. You know, and I am speaking about it because I live in that area, you know, I know there's a storage company right across the way that's been there for over 40 years. There's one down the street. There's another one down the street. We don't need another one. There could be such a better use for that land. And giving it c free status is a blank check. The last time I checked, there was no company that wanted to buy it. There was no blueprints, there was no design. And it's very hard for my community to clean up all the messes we've already done. Hatcher Road is a perfect example. We were able to clean that up, but that's taken five years. If we get this storage unit, I don't know how long it would be for us to clean up this area too, because it's going to be an issue. And I would just put a pause on this so my community can come and put their public comments to you because they didn't know. And I know I'm the only one so far registered and I would love for them to be able to say what they want to say to you. Thank you. Thank you. Marty hall. Afternoon. My name is Marty Hall. I represent the owner of the property. Thank you for this opportunity. The very first thing I want to bring to your attention is this property is located at a dead end street. It is. There's only one way singular access to this property. It is currently zone ten, the nearest sewer system that's even available to this site, considering that a zone 110 reals is in excess of 500ft. So the economics of extending a sewer for a singular parcel for r 110 just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Sense one. Number two is we proceeded from the very beginning in following all the protocol that the city has required of us regarding notification to all the neighbors as well as our adjacent neighbors. We've met with all the adjacent neighbors making sure that we're addressing any concerns they have. To date, I don't believe there is any the adjacent neighbors that have any issues with what we're trying to accomplish. We've met with a village hearing. We appeared before village hearing. They voted in favor of this project. The planning staff has recommended approval for this project. In response to the young lady that just spoke here, they asked us to appear before their, which I believe they referred to Sunnyside historical organization. We met with them. There was six people, six or seven people that had signed in asking questions. We met with them for well over an hour reviewing what we were proposing, answering their questions. And they had asked at that time, let's just continue this because no one came up with a solution that was any better than what we'd already had presented. We have not heard from them ever since then. So it is my opinion. Oops. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you. Any questions for any of our folks, we will believe that's everyone. So we will close the public hearing and I will turn to the vice mayor. Thank you, mayor. I had an opportunity to talk to some of the village committee members. The majority were in support. I also had an opportunity to talk, talk to some of the adjoining property owners. Originally there was some issues with access and they've been resolved.

We will have one public hearing, but two votes will begin with a staff report. Good afternoon, mayor, members of the city council. With me today is deputy director Tricia Gomes. In planner three, Sarah Socom. They'll give the presentation for item 1102 and the companion 103. Thank you, mayor. Members of the council. Items number 102 and 103 are located. Apologize. Items number 102 and 103 are located approximately 863 60ft south of the southwest corner of 51st Avenue and Carver Road. Item 102 is GPALV 322 eight. It is a general plan amendment to allow commercial commerce park, various residential designations and resort. Item 103 is z 53 22 eight is a request to rezone to plan unit development to allow single family and multifamily residential commercial uses and some commerce park. There is single family residential to the north and east with a mix of traditional and large lots. The large lots are within Maricopa county and the city. To the west is the loop 202 freeway and the Gila River Indian reservation. Southeast of the subject site is the South Mountain park and preserve. The Gila Foothills Pud includes twelve development units and three distinct character areas. The Levine Village planning committee recommended denials file and approve, with modifications to add residential one to two, three and a half to five, and five to ten designations by an eight to zero vote for the general plan amendment and recommended approval of the planning of the PUD zoning request per a staff memo, with modifications and additional stipulations by a vote to eight to zero. The planning commission recommended approval of the general plan amendment per the Levine Village Planning Committee recommendation by a vote of eight to zero and recommended approval of the PUD zoning request per the staff memo dated April 4, 2024, with a modification and deleted stipulation by a vote of six to two. This depicts the land use map designation changes recommended by the village planning committee and the planning Commission. The applicant has continued to work with the community and councilwoman Hodge Washington's office to address concerns and has agreed to several revisions to the stipulations as outlined in the memo dated May 13, 2024. A brief overview of the changes include locating residential office uses away from existing residential towards the street and southern perimeter of Du and eight reserves Du two for hospital use for the first five years removes auto dealerships and retail sales and rental from DU two prohibits multifamily development within the designated l shaped area in DU eight reserves 50 acres for a resort use in Du nine a nine b ten for the first five years prohibits tobacco oriented and marijuana related businesses adds landscaping and shade or cool paving requirements for auto dealerships adds bonus provisions to earn additional units from the base requirements and requires biannual land development updates for three years, then transitions to annual updates and with that staff recommends approval of GPA Lv 322 per the planning Commission's recommendation and adoption of the related resolution and recommends approval of Z 53 22 per the May 13, 2024 memo from the planning and development director and adopt the related ordinance. And with that, I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you so much. Any questions. So we will have two presentations now, ten minutes aside. Each side is welcome to use their ten minutes as they see fit, so if you would like to pass to multiple speakers, you may do so. Anyone who doesn't speak during that time period will have two minutes to speak and address the council. The applicant can reserve to two minutes, up to two minutes for rebuttal. If wishing to do so, we'll begin with Wendy Riddell for the applicant. Thank you, madam mayor, members of the council. I'm hoping staff can help me out and pull.

It will also create a reservation of land for a 50 acre resort site that we're working very closely with Chris. It will provide the first trailhead into South Mountain park in Levine working with the City of Phoenix to provide a fire station through a development agreement. And it creates a mixed use retail development, includes some billboards, create branding opportunities for Levine and some much needed housing. I will tell you that this is a down zoning from the original Tierra Montania PCD. It's actually a reduction of 929 units from those original entitlements. All of this, of course, necessitated by the construction of the Ed pastor freeway that has come through. When we began this case, there was significant opposition. There were really even over 100 people back in October of 2022. And we have been hard at work. Several villagers hearings enough to ultimately earn a unanimous recommendation of approval from the Levine Village planning committee. Those are not words I get to utter very often and certainly not ones I get to utter on a 300 acre pud. So how did we earn unanimous village support? We agreed to 45, some 45 modified stipulations that we very carefully negotiated with village leadership and with the Levine community from a high level. They included an improved traffic solution, ultimately a reduction in height, additional step backs and setbacks from existing residential. We added single family R 118 and Du eight. We reduced the height of the hospital tower. We agreed to a setback and a buffer. We added sustainability standards. We added additional architectural standards. We agreed to come back through pho on much of it. And we agreed to work with the neighbors on 47th Avenue in ultimately privatizing their road. Probably the biggest component of our success. Creating that success at the village was again creating 118 or agreeing to r 118 in Du eight creating what we called a synergistic plan with the Levine community including one story homes adjacent to Estrella and 47th Avenue with a 50 foot landscape setback and no vehicular access onto Estrella or 47th Avenue, again ultimately helping to privatize 47th Avenue. There was one sticking point, however, as we got through village and through planning commission and it related to the density at the Levine village. We had a recommendation of a, what I'll call that base density of 1200 units. And we were afforded a five bonus with a level one trauma hospital. The planning commission was willing to allow us to go back to that 2200 units with a 1700 base and a 500 unit bonus. But there continued to be concern as we headed to council. And so we have been very hard at work with the councilwoman, Hodge Washington, the council office, with the Levine leadership and with the Levine community. And ultimately we have reached a compromise. That compromise is essentially the developer. It gets their deal, they get the 2200 units, but the community gets their terms. And the type of density is the community is the very density that the community has been asking for from the beginning. And we think this is a very carefully negotiated and a very fair compromise. So essentially, the way it works is we have the 1200 units by right. We have a level one trauma which would give us the ability to bring 500 more units in. If we have restaurants and retail that are greater than 15 acres, then we earn 250 more units. If we provide senior housing, defined as 55 plus deed restricted, then we can earn an additional 150 units. And if we provide platted townhomes using the SFI, we're. We get an additional hundred units. So with that, we are very grateful for the hard work that everyone was willing to put into this case with us. We have what we think is a very successful project for the city of Phoenix. It will have a level one trauma hospital, EV auto campuses, which is a huge tax revenue generator, trailhead resort and more much needed housing. You can see through this that we have done a significant amount of outreach and hard work with the community. Community. And we're very pleased to have this compromise today before the council as evidenced by the 30 page memo, an additional 14 stipulations that we've agreed to before coming here. So with that, Madam Mayor, members of the council, we would respectfully request your approval. I'm happy to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal as needed. And, of course, happy to answer any questions that you might have. Thank you. And for your rebuttal, would you like to go after all other speakers? Yes, please. All right, John is next. And again, you have ten minutes. If you want to have multiple speakers, that's fine. If you want to use the whole ten minutes, that also works. Thank you, Madam Mayor. It's John Bisdell, by the way. I realize that name's a little difficult to pronounce, but I don't think I'll need my ten minutes in its entirety, so that's okay. Thank you for having me here today. I was the appellant that filed the appeal May 1, and obviously the community had some concerns regarding the density because from day one, this really has been about density.

Does anybody even agree with what you have to say? And of course, my position at that time was I'm a voice of one today, but I'll have the whole community behind me when I come to the city council. And I think when you saw the pictures of the Levine village, when we got the community mobilized, we packed that place and we just didn't pack it. We had standing room only. But I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Keisha's efforts. And so I want to take the opportunity to thank her and the whole team. That's worked. Okay, here we go. The community put together a whole bunch of things that we wanted to see if we could get incorporated into the Gila Foothills development. And we're pleased to say that Keisha and the developers listened to the bulk of what we had to say. There's still some things that we would have liked to have seen incorporated, but at the end of the day, we really have to stand back and say, what did this development look like when it started and what does it look like today? And from the community's perspective, some of the things that we were after, we were able to get the Levine village to embrace with us, you know, some of those significant items at the February 12 meeting was they did not endorse the Gila Foothills development as it was originally drafted. They agreed. With a decrease in density size recommendation of single family residences along Estrella and 47th Avenue, we secured a major win for the residents there in terms of having them agree to limiting the building height at the resort at 20ft for the first hundred feet versus the proposed 40. So that was cut in half. We had them address some landscaping options because the concern was, what does landscaping do for the view? And I actually created the 1200 units, and I was really very pleased to see that the council adopted that in terms of their baseline. As wendy mentioned, there was a huge synergistic win for development unit eight. When we talk about large lots across the street, farms and acreage, it just made zero sense to have the type of density that was opposed across the street. And again, I could talk until I'm blue in the face, but without Keisha's help. And I wanted to personally thank the Lions family and the development team as well, because obviously, a few folks didn't embrace what the community was trying to push back. Again, I wouldn't be here today. I'm still looking to read, though, to work something for my Bermuda triangle. And he knows what I'm talking about for Tierra, Montana, so I'll leave it at that. The 47th Avenue folks also will have the ability to have their road completely privatized. So we think that's a great thing as well. Again, very generous offer by the development team to foot the bill on that. And Keisha was very innovative in terms of how she crafted the elements that would allow this plan to go forward from 1700 to 2200. Because I can tell you, for those that answered your email, you saw the presentation I sent you from two weeks ago that looked entirely different than what I'm presenting here today. And Kesha was able to discuss a couple more items, the 55 plus, which was a big item for the community because Levine. There's a lot of older residents in Levine, especially in the acreage areas surrounding this development. And quite frankly, as they age, there's nowhere to go. So to have a 55 plus area in the community, that's just outstanding. And Keisha, we just want to thank you for helping facilitate that activity, as well as ownership of the townhomes rather than just rental units. I put together a lot of presentations because I met with a lot of people, and this chart kind of summarizes excerpts from some of those. It all started with the flyer that we sent out again, to get the community involved and get their participation here. And I think with the show from the community and a reminder to the village and the development team that what's the character of Levine? Rural. And we appreciate the fact that you made every effort to try to help us with that. So the bottom line is, with the great progress that Kesha has been able to facilitate over the last couple of weeks, the community folks that I represent are dropping our opposition to this development, and we're going to support it. Now, when I say that, are there going to be people opposed to this? Of course there are. I can't speak for everybody 100%, but in terms of the organized effort that we had to try to make betterment for the community, like I said, Keisha's just done an outstanding job facilitating that. And again, I want to thank the Lions family and the development team for recognizing that. Last chart. I want to leave you with is a call to action. You're not going to get off that scot free. So one of the concerns the community still has is this development changes the zoning for the resort area.

So one of the concerns the community still has is this development changes the zoning for the resort area. And the resort area, by the way, on this chart is right up against the base of South Mountain there, one of the most pristine areas we have left in Levine, and it's currently zoned when this passes, at 40 dwelling units per acre. And in talking with Reed, if the development builds out 2200 dwelling units, there isn't an opportunity to build more dwelling units in the resort. The resort should just be a resort. The community's concern is, when I talked with marsha bushing from the planning council regarding the South Mountain, they had an area designated for the resort off of 7th street. It never happened. And what wound up happening is it just defaulted to the zoning, which was multifamily, and they built multifamily there. The community's concern is, in the event that we don't get a resort buyer or builder in five years, what's going to happen? That area is going to be zoned for 40 acres, 40 units per acre density, as opposed to the current 20, which is what the RH resort is for, section 629, and what I'd like the council to do now, and I'm not sure how the process is, if somebody needs to make a motion or how it works, but if we don't see what happens in terms of a resort and that lands just there, granted, the developer is going to have to come back and say, hey, we couldn't get a resort. It's already zoned for 40 per acre. We're capped at 1700. So why don't we just go ahead and build 40 per acre? That's not compatible at all with the area. So what we're asking for today is, however you need to do it. We'd like to see the council take a motion, and if we can't get a resort buyer, put it back to the 20 units per acre, because the developer is going to have to come back and anyway, to present whatever they're going to do in the event they can't find a resort buyer or developer. But at least that protects the community to a degree. Because at the end of the day, five, six years from now, I might not be here, you folks might not be here, and everyone's going to forget this discussion. Kind of like the discussion on the train terminal. We just can't have that. So I'd like to have that documented today because that discussion will be opened up later. And with that, I'll give you a minute and 24 seconds back. Thank you. Thank you. And John? Do you want John to stay? Okay. I'm sorry. I thought she has a question, but not. Vice mayor so I am familiar with perversions and it is a process. You can't simply revert without going back to an actual public hearing. Hearing. And I know I've been out of planning for a few years, but is that the way the law still works? Mayor? Vice mayor Stark, members of the council, you are correct. If this was conventional zoning, it just couldn't revert back in the pud. Obviously, if there were modifications to address that, the council would need to make a modification. So I guess what I'm saying is we can revisit it, but it doesn't automatically go back to 20. I just wanted to. You shaking your head like you understand that. So. Okay. I just wanted to make sure everyone understood that. I know we've used that stipulation in the past, but sometimes I think people don't understand. That means we reopen and have another hearing. So thank you. Thank you, mayor. Thank you. We will next go to additional comments. We'll begin with virtual public comments with Dan Penton followed by Joanne Jensen. Hello. Can you hear me? We can.

Yes, this has been a long, tedious redevelopment proposal going on somewhere north of two years now. However, I'm disappointed that in the year that South Mountain is celebrating its 100th anniversary that we're proposing to put a sprawling 80 acre, ten dealership auto mall that will do nothing but bring more urban heat island and all kinds of urbanization to the base of South Mountain in one of the most pristine areas of Phoenix.

I am a member of the Levine village planning committee and one of those eight who was finally able to vote unanimously in favor of the Gila foothills proposal that you have in front of you. I believe that this proposal will bring the variety of housing, it will bring the variety of commercial and the variety of tax paying incentives to a community that has long been asking for it. I am very excited about the way that the community, our council member, our other stakeholders, including the developer, have worked together over a very long period of time in order to bring this to you today. So this is a full throated support and thanks. And I really do believe that it's going to enhance the quality of life in Levine. I'm very interested in the incentive program, which I think is very creative. And I imagine that it may be one of the first times we've seen it, but it may not be the last. I think it's a great way to address everyone's issues in a very creative way. And I thank you very much. That's all I have for today. Thank you. Linda is next, followed by Maria. Good afternoon, mayor and council. I appreciate the opportunity to speak today. My name is. I'm the chair of the Levine Village planning committee and have been involved in this for coming on two years now. So I've seen it through the process and I won't take long. But I just want to reiterate what Wendy was saying. I do feel like as we've worked through this process, all stakeholders have been able to express their priorities and have those priorities addressed. And I appreciate Councilman Hodge Washington's efforts in that and the community for being involved. And I do think that this is a good proposal that brings in all of the interests brought up over the last long time of working on this. Thank you. Thank you. Maria is next, followed by Frank. Hi. Good afternoon. When I first found out about this proposed development, quite frankly, I was horrified because this was the last pristine area of Levine at the base of South Mountain. But through, you know, working with my neighbors, working with the representatives of the Lions family, Reed and Wendy, we were able to find compromises that the community can live with and made the development better. And ultimately, we came to an impasse at one point. And without the leadership of our councilwoman, I don't think the community and everybody could have come together. So, you know, when I read your website, councilwoman, you know, it says you build compromise and you really do and get people to come together. So I wanted to thank you for all of your efforts and Levine is very lucky to have you as their council person. And I want to thank the Lions family and Reed and Wendy and everybody for all their efforts. I think people have spent thousands and thousands of hours on this. So we do support the development as currently proposed. So thank you. Thank you. Frank is next, followed by Stephanie. Thank you. What hasn't been addressed here is the traffic coming off of this field. Hayfield across from Estrella on one side, 51st Avenue on the other side. Now, they proposed to put apartments in there, which is, I think, 1700. That equals out to about 3500 people. Well, that equals out to about 3000 cars. You have one road getting onto the freeway. You have north and south. You have 51st Avenue, one road. Now, you're taking 3000 cars out there every morning, every night, all during the day because there's no services in that area. And even if they put in small services, there's no big services there, like big shopping center type situations. Now, I keep hearing on the tv this morning they told me not to turn my lawnmower on. Today they're talking about putting 3000 cars sitting there idling, trying to get onto that freeway every day, all day long from now on, from here till eternity. There's a simple way around this. You just reach in there and take those 3000 cars out. Pick them out of the equation. Take those 3500 people out. Take them out of the equation. You take those apartments out. Take them out of the equation. Go back to 19 2017 and get those rules. Then make that whole section on the e on the west east side of 51st Avenue. You make that into houses like it was originally designed. That brings you down to two or 300 cars. Well, that's a heck of a lot different than these 3000 sitting there idling because you're going to have to idle to get onto the freeway. So this is my problem. Thank you. Thank you.

It's huge. It's the last chunk of land that we have an opportunity to have a lot of input on. I'm really here to thank everybody that was involved, led by Linda. We brought everyone together. Everyone involved together. I want to thank the community for not just coming out and giving input, but for learning and understanding the process, bringing other people out. I want to thank our planner, Nayeli. She got hit hard with a lot of stuff and we really appreciate her. We're very glad that she didn't quit. I want to thank the village committee for all the extra time they had to put into it. I want to thank the planning department. They helped a ton with language, some of the comments from earlier. We worked hard to get this language as solid as we can because we can't trust developers all the time. I want to thank economic development. Chris gets calls, texts, meetings at random. And thank you for all the future text calls and meetings. I also want to thank Wendy Rydell. You may know it can be difficult to appreciate a zoning lawyer, but Wendy, actually, I like and respect you a lot. And you made this so much better. So you guys are very smart for hiring her. I think she's fantastic. Keisha Rockstar, we love your lawyer hat. You helped with the language. You helped with the compromise at the end. I appreciate you so much. And most importantly, this would not be the beauty it is if it weren't for Linda. She went over this. She spent so much time on it. I can't even tell you how any other, anybody else wouldn't have given it this time. So we owe you a ton for this. Thank you so much. And thank you, everybody, for everything you've done. Thank you. And, Wendy, if you could address some of the sustainability elements in addition to whatever you think is important to emphasize. Yes, of course. Mayor, members of the council, first, if you had told me at the end of this case that I would have the support of Linda, Stephanie, the village, as well as John and Maria standing before you, I would have told you you were crazy. So we are very, very grateful for the leadership across the board and all the hard work to have gotten here. You asked me specifically to address sustainability. So we agreed to additional sustainability measures, not only in the original pud at the village level. They had us add additional required items and sort of up the ante of what we had to include in the most recent, there was also concern expressed making sure that the auto dealership lots don't become something that contributes to the heat island. So we agreed to additional shading measures there. One way that we can achieve that is through traditional structured shade landscaping or by use of cool pavement. So those were additional heightened requirements that were placed on us. Thank you. I just want to ask, I'll ask you a few questions and then I'll make my comments. I want you to take a second to address one of the concerns we heard from Frank regarding Estrella in 55th. Yes, of course. So, Madam Mayor, Councilwoman Hodge, Washington. So actually, that was probably the biggest concern we had in the very beginning was transportation and how we were dealing with 51st in Australia, because it frankly is a problem today. And we will thank the streets department and planning staff working with us and came up with what I think is quite a creative solution, which is essentially shifting the road south, in effect, privatizing cul de sacing Estrella, letting it maintain more of its existing community condition and really making our community more insular. So you didn't have the amount of traffic going into the neighborhood. So we worked hard to create a better transportation solution here that was pretty warmly embraced by the rest of the community. Thank you. The only other question I wanted you to specifically address, and I guess the comment would be with respect to the location of the auto mall, we tried to move it as close as possible to the freeway, recognizing the beauty that is the south mountain. Is there anything else you would like to add on that for sure? So it was very carefully placed and in fact, one of the requirements that you had of us or the last minute negotiations was to make sure that everything stayed south of Estrella. And it really is tucked up against the freeway. It's also sort of well buffered by the development. Before you get to Gila Foothills Parkway, some additional of the townhomes, multi family. So it really is visible off of the freeway, but it is kept away from the rest of the community. We also have pretty strict design guidelines for the three character areas that help ensure it is well done. Thank you so much. That includes my questions. I'll go ahead and make a couple remarks. I want to start off first by saying thank you to staff, especially Nayali.

Is there anything else you would like to add on that for sure? So it was very carefully placed and in fact, one of the requirements that you had of us or the last minute negotiations was to make sure that everything stayed south of Estrella. And it really is tucked up against the freeway. It's also sort of well buffered by the development. Before you get to Gila Foothills Parkway, some additional of the townhomes, multi family. So it really is visible off of the freeway, but it is kept away from the rest of the community. We also have pretty strict design guidelines for the three character areas that help ensure it is well done. Thank you so much. That includes my questions. I'll go ahead and make a couple remarks. I want to start off first by saying thank you to staff, especially Nayali. She did a phenomenal job of managing the community's concerns. On this. I want to also say thank you to the applicant, Wendy Riddell, and her client, the Lions family, for ensuring that they were receptive to the community. Feedback I want to also say thank you to the entirety of the Levine Village planning committee, led by the chair, Linda Abeg. They did a phenomenal job getting this to where it was, even the planning commission. It went a little different than we thought, but it gave us an opportunity to make the the pud better. I want to say thank you also to LCRD. They also chimed in with their comments in order to make this better, John Bissell and Maria Regan as well, and the community as a whole for their active participation. This PUD, as you heard, spans almost 300 acres and it's one of the last remaining acreage in the Levine village. This proposed development guarded a huge deal of media coverage when it first started and for us to be sitting here today where we have very what I would call not to minimize the opposition that was stated to have as little opposition as we have right now, I think it's a great example of what happens when we compromise and we work towards a common goal. I think everyone in appearance wanted to figure out how best we could make this something that the entirety of Levine would benefit from and be proud of. And I am proud to sit here and make the motion for a a pud that will bring us the needed commercial. It would also bring us our needed close the public hearing. Sorry, my apologies. But same sentiments. I'm here. I'm proud of the pud. It includes the commercial that Levine desperately wants. It includes the residential options. It's a new housing opportunity. We will probably, hopefully they will bring some town homes to our area, which is another variety of housing that we need in this area. And it will hopefully bring the highlights hospital for our, for our residents as well as the 55 plus. Trying to find my language here. So I would like to move to approve item number 102 for the planning commission recommendation and adopt a related resolution. Second, we have a motion and a second. Congratulations, councilwoman. The Kesha Hajj Washington incentive plan may become a good role. It really was a unique way to get things done and achieve multiple different goals. So thank you to everyone who made that possible. For those who don't follow city hearings as much, it is pretty unusual to have so many different carrots to achieve community goals. And I think it may become something that we use more and more often. So congratulations to everyone who put it together. It is truly a carrot focused way to achieve the property owners goals, the partners, as well as the community needs. The Lyons family, I think we've been talking for twelve years about level one trauma center. So, gosh, that would be great to see that open. You've made a lot of commitments. We are confident you're going to keep them. And the we're gonna achieve multiple different goals of the community, from housing supplies to celebrating South Mountain park. And it's cool that this is moving forward. In the hundredth anniversary year, there's a chance that auto dealership will be the most sustainable in Phoenix. So that will be exciting to see. So congratulations to the councilwoman Taneyle, to all of the community leaders. For those of you who don't follow the Levine village, it is a big deal to get this kind of vote out of there. This is a bunch of educated, involved folks who have very high standards. And I think two months ago, I'm not sure I thought this level of people coming together would be possible. So a real credit to many, many people. Any additional comments by spare? Yes. I just want to say good work to the councilwoman. And I know I've heard from residents because I have a few friends that live in Levine. I think you know one of them. He's a neighbor of yours. And I know there's a huge need for the hospital. So I think that's a real win. And I do appreciate all the hard work you did on this. I certainly will be supporting this motion. Roll call. Galindo Vida. Yes. Guardado. Yes. Hodge. Washington. Yes.

We will begin with Elizabeth Venable, followed by Ed Hermes. 1 second. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay, so I see my minutes already started, but thank you for waiting for a second. I see. So, obviously I represent the fund for empowerment and the people that meet outside are called the Houseless Leadership Project. And so that's who you walk through when you walk through our meetings. And part of the reason why we meet outside is to be viewed as constituents of the city of Phoenix. Because we reside and shop and often work in the city of Phoenix. Right. And as constituents, we are very concerned that voices be represented in the budget. And I know it's a little bit late in the budget process, but we wanted to give our input, basically what our priorities are. I emailed you actually the full text of our priorities, as amended by all of our members today. So I won't include all the parentheses and all the individual details, but I will go over the list really briefly because I only have two more minutes. The first is housing with a wide variety of stipulations, but not just limited to SMI for a variety of people in the city, and affordable, transitional and long term housing for people who have experienced homelessness. Second, shelters, especially ones that are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities act and include support for service animals, fair rules, charging train security, professionally minded staff, possession, storage, clean and free from hazards, hygiene supplies and support to obtain real compliance, supportive staff, trained counselors available in college 24/7 job programs. This is a huge component of what people want. People do not necessarily want to be given things. They want to be sustainable, self sustainable. They want to be able to work. And a lot of people only need assistance in obtaining such employment or, you know, specific programs that eliminate barriers to those their employment. Transportation, especially free transportation, are more accessible to people who are low income or facing homelessness, especially in demand for 24 hours transportation. Even unreasonable as that might seem, it's very effective for people to be employed, et cetera, et cetera, education and skills trainings for quote unquote jobs of the future and other vocational programs, medical assistance and outpatient community mental health services because actually not everybody qualifies for access 24/7 public restrooms this is a critical and drinking fountain food assistance with emergency support to retain in present to remain in prison housing vouchers, eviction prevention and legal assistance in eviction proceedings. Heat response and cooling centers that allow sleep. This is a large problem during the day even. And childcare. Those are our primary feedback from our members. We think that these are appropriate policy responses that can address and prevent homelessness. Thank you. Ed is next, followed by Eric. Thank you, Madam Mayor. Hi. For the record, Ed Hermas, 212 West Montecito. I'm here today as the president of the Carnation Neighborhood association. And I'm here today to ask the council to put on the agenda and to vote to end the reverse lanes on 7th Avenue and 7th street. As a president of a neighborhood association, it's often hard to build consensus. There's one thing that our neighborhoods have consensus about. It is ending the reverse lanes because of the deleterious effects that they have in our communities, especially on our businesses along 7th Avenue and 7th street, which are made inaccessible oftentimes because of how our residents have to drive out of the way to avoid them. Because not only just a confusion, but because they hurt the connectivity between our communities. Our community is resolute against the reverse lanes. Recently. I'm coming here today because recently out of ASU was published a fantastic study I just stumbled upon. And I have copies for everybody on the council. I'll also email them to you as well. Where the data shows and the traffic counts show the reverse lanes do not work in 2024. They were put in in 1978 and in 1981 at a time pre state Route 51. Right now, pursuant to Ashto standards, the reverse lanes do not justify themselves and the deleterious impact that they have in our communities, especially on our small businesses in the Melrose area and on 7th street as well, they really negatively impact those businesses because people cannot access them. One of my good friends who wishes he could be here today from short leash, hot dogs talking to him yesterday, said, we would love to sell coffee. We would love to sell donuts in the morning, but we're on the wrong side of 7th Avenue. People literally and legally cannot get to us and won't get to us. And we have to adjust our business hours because of it. It's hurt our businesses.

And the gentleman who headed up the studies here today, Mohammed, I believe he's going to speak with you shortly as well, to give you a brief overview of it, but ask that you review it and put it on the agenda to finally end the reverse lanes. So thank you so much, madam. Mayor and council. And if I could. Oh, would you mind passing these out? Thank you so much. Thank you. Should be enough for everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Eric is next, followed by Dave. Hi, my name is Eric. Today I came to speak about something specific. Before I get to that, I want to bring up the whole thing about what to name the central station after. I knew Ed Pastor and I know Greg Stanton, and it's hard because they're both legends in my eyes. But I would point out that my friend Earl Wilcox basically does everything in his neighborhood. And one time I said to him, you know, why is Grant park, why isn't it called Wilcox park? And his reply was, is, you're supposed to wait till after someone dies to name something after them. So it's kind of an unwritten rule. I don't know if y'all are comfortable with breaking that. So anyway, what I came to talk about today is probably, in my opinion, the most prestigious redevelopment opportunity in metro Phoenix. I lived in South Phoenix for the last three years. I'm moving out soon. But one thing I noticed is when they were talking about the downtown cores and connecting them to other cores, the other day I was walking from my house on 20th street and Broadway to downtown Phoenix and I took away by a church that I go to sometimes. And one thing I noticed is if you go up 12th street, there's acres and acres of the most primus. Other than the fact that it's kind of south of the dump, it's some of the most prime real estate in the city of Phoenix. We're talking enough room to build anything you want. South Phoenix is one of the most historically underserved areas of the city. It took Greg Stanton putting light rail down there to get it kind of activated. But I think if we could build a south central downtown Phoenix in the area I'm talking about, which the city already owns a large part of the land, I noticed, I think that we could then connect sort of downtown going by 24th street to this sort of this new downtown area, and they would have a downtown in between downtown Phoenix and downtown Tempe. And I was going to suggest we put a hospital there because South Phoenix desperately needs a hospital. But I think the location that the people who left and apparently didn't care that much, I think that that location is probably better because most of the shootings in South Phoenix happen on the southwest side anyway. But I really encourage you guys to take a look at the area of land I'm talking about and do your best to buy up as much land around the park, the park that the city of Phoenix already owns, because I think we could bring a lot of stuff to South Phoenix that's not there, such as maybe a big box electronics store, things that people expect, the amenities that people expect that South Phoenix is currently lacking. And like I said, there's more than enough land to do whatever you need to do with it. With that said, I would just like to add that reverse lanes are hella dangerous. Thank you for your time. Thank you. We have Dave next, followed by Julia. Thank you, mayor and council members. My name is Dave Riley. I am a licensed traffic engineer in Arizona. I spent the first part of my career as a consultant, and then the next part, I was at ADOT, and I specialized in doing special projects similar to the Phoenix reverse lanes. I have a draft study, this is separate from the ASU study that was referred to earlier, that I would like to share some of that data with you. I've had the privilege of already sharing some of that data with some of the members, council members here. There seems to be good consensus that the way the reverse lanes are today is not good. They can't stay. So the question becomes, do we get rid of them or do we make a change? Right now, they don't meet national traffic standards. They don't meet Arizona traffic standards. So that change would be adding 438 digital led signs to these streets so they would meet standards. This would make them less confusing. But what I found in looking at this data of the reverse lanes, these signs won't address the big problems. So there's five big things that I found that I was. I can't say I was surprised, because you can see it with your own eyes if you drive them. 7th Avenue and 7th street are the lowest congested streets in the whole area. So that's talking Thomas, to Northern and 16th street and 19th Avenue. Even includes I 17, the 51 central. You take all those, and you look at delay per mile. 7th Avenue and 7th street are the lowest. So what happens when we take the reverse lanes away? They are still the lowest.

Now, that came out of Mohammed's ASU study that was referred to earlier, and so they're just not needed. The next thing is losing that center turn lane. It is a big deal. It does make it hard to get around. Number three, these things are dangerous. Traffic accidents are two times higher than a normal road in rush hour. That results in one excess crash every day because we're choosing to have the reverse lanes going. Number four, it forces any left turning traffic to go through an unsignalized road that's a neighborhood or a business parking lot. Fifth is. They are unpopular. Thank you. Thank you. Julia is next, followed by Mohamed. I've brought up Mystery Castle to you so much. I know you guys probably think I'm the advocate or the face for the castle. There was a Kjazz article that went out about the demolition. And I asked Kjazz, I said, what was the response? 90,000 clicks within the first day. And the person who did the article, Robert Pella, got hundreds and hundreds of messages about the castle, the demolition. And then the next article came out that everything inside the castle has been given away. So I was surprised to find Mary Lou's bed for sale on Facebook marketplace for $800. I just checked. It's still for sale. When I messaged some of the people that were selling mystery castle relics, they told me in August they all went into the castle, picked what they wanted, took it out of the castle, took it home, and now we're just selling it and that some things went to the dumpster they don't know. That broke my heart. That broke a lot of people's heart. If you get the chance to watch. Debbie Abels did a city of Phoenix video where she toured the castle with Marylou. And Mary Lou talked about every single piece and what it meant to her. Her family's pottery, her father's bed, all of that's gone. You cannot find it back. You can't get it back. You can't. I've talked with professionals in the industry who have said you're lucky if you can get any of the items back. Where would you even store them? So all that is gone, which is heartbreaking to me. I've had other historical institutions that are going through the same issue with different properties, you know, being destroyed or up for demolition or things just going away. I think the city of Phoenix really needs to figure out a solution so we don't run into this problem again. I mean, it's a horrible thing to lose. We're not going to get any of those items back. I had someone come in who made custom dolls for Mary Lou and was able to send me photos of the dolls she made. And she told me the story of why Mary Lou wanted those dolls. You know, we're not going to be able to find that unless you go from the 1952 book and try and cross reference to make sure everything that was in the castle is actually what you're getting. I mean, it's just a terrible piece of history to lose. And with the albedo house, we were lucky that got postponed. This one still isn't postponed. It's just, it's an issue I keep seeing. I have tombstone reaching out to me about how they can save their properties. I have Scottsdale, all these other places that are coming into the same issue. I think it would be great to find a solution for this so we don't run into this down the road. We wouldn't want this to happen to Tovrek Castle. This wouldn't happen to Tovara Castle. It's happening to Mystery Castle. It will happen to more properties down the line as we go. So I would just like you guys to consider some sort of solution for historic places and things so we can have, you know, our history saved as we're going. We need to have our history. We don't have a Phoenix historical society. We had a Phoenix history museum that went away. You know, all we have is the Arizona Historical Society. So we need more Phoenix history so we can learn from our past and grow. Thank you. Thank you. Mohammed is next, followed by Nicole. Yeah, my name is Mohammed. I'm a recent graduate student at ASU majoring in transportation engineering. So a few months back, I got to read the report that was published by the city of Phoenix, which was contracted to a private firm, and I believe it was published in 2021. And upon reading the report, I observed that the report overlooked very basic fundamentals within the traffic operation of reverse lanes. And one of the agendas that the study failed to measure or calculate is the lane utilization rate, which in layman terms is how many drivers are actually driving on the reverse lane. So the study or the report concluded that if we were to remove the reverse lane, that travel time would increase up to 40%, which is simply not true, since if you're not measuring the lane utilization rate or how much traffic is actually driving with the reverse lane, so your assumption is simply not true.

The other agenda that I calculated, which, as David reiterated, is the collision rates being twice as much on 7th street and 7th Avenue. I also conducted a collision comparison with two other streets that don't have the reverse lane, and the collisions that occurred on 7th street and 7th Avenue were much more safe, significant than any other nearby streets that don't have the reverse lane. And I just want to conclude that in the traffic engineering world, it's often a trade off between safety and minimizing delay. And the way I see it, and with the current conditions of the reverse lane, that it's failing at both metrics of safety and minimizing delay. Thank you. Thank you so much. Nicole is next. Mayor, council. Thank you. And thank you, Muhammad. I'm realizing my eyes are not that well right now, so I'm gonna try to do my best reading this. Phoenix is a city that thrives on connection, and streets serve as those conduits to community connections. Streets, not highways, yet outdated. Reverse lanes on 7th street and 7th Avenue continue to set those connections. Instead of being streets, they're hostile highway bypasses that ignored the needs of central Phoenix residents and communities. Reverse lanes have no culture, no meaning other than to rush hour past an urban core. These lanes are barriers. They force drivers on detours, isolate residents, and stifle local businesses, which are the livelihood and lifeblood of our community. These reverse lanes are not the solution for Phoenix's future. They directly contradict the city's forward thinking initiatives of complete street policy vision, zero climate action plan, and which they aimed for safer, more sustainable streets. Instead, the reverse lanes create a divided city with a struggling economy in some of our areas of the urban core. But there's a clear path forward. We can reconnect our communities, revitalize, strengthen our businesses, and reimagine our streets by removing these outdated lanes. Envision a phoenix where vibrant neighborhoods flow seamlessly into one another. Picture bustling streets teeming with thriving businesses accessible to everyone. And this is the future that I want to imagine. Imagine a city where getting around doesn't involve confusing maze of detours. This is the phoenix we can build. And it sounds like this is the year for it, the 100 year mark for sustainability as well. So this is more than just a traffic issue, as we've heard from the two traffic engineers. It's about the future of our city, and we deserve way better. And we deserve a phoenix that prioritizes safety, fosters connection, and cultivates a thriving local economy. So we hope that we could join forces and raise more, you know, human capital on this issue. And I do want to thank our streets director, who has been very attentive on this and diplomatic. Not all leadership has been as willing to work, and some feign that they even remember ever meeting with us, which is entirely frustrating, especially because I don't actually enjoy doing this. It actually is almost like a part time job, and a lot of us have very busy lives. These folks that spoke to you today and some that haven't been able to speak yet. It's a burden for us to come down here and once again, we don't enjoy doing it. I don't enjoy doing it at least. But we're hoping that we can work together and we're hoping that city leadership and I've had good working relationships with various council members up here before, and I'm really excited about our streets director, but I just want to leave it with that. So. And thank you again for your support time. Thank you so much. Theresa will be our final speaker. Hello, my name is Theresa Dickinson. I'm the owner of Melrose Pharmacy. So a business that's in the 7th Avenue Melrose district area. I'm also a new resident of district three for Deborah. So welcome to me. So I am now in the Royal Palm neighborhood. I now am driving down 7th Avenue every day and up every evening when I'm driving home from work. So now I'm starting to see the commute side of it. I'm also the vice president of the 7th Avenue Merchants association. The association is adamantly opposed, exposed to the reverse lanes. I would like to see that the reverse lanes go away. I have had people tell me that they won't come to my business just because of the reverse lanes. I think that's a very poor reason to not come to our businesses. In my drive up and down now I am seeing no reason for the reverse lanes. There's plenty of areas for the people who are speeding in the reverse lane lane to actually move into the regular traffic lanes. I do see road rage from people who get upset about what's going on there. We don't need new studies. You can do a drive by yourself and see how confusing it is every time.

Many people don't understand it and people are yelled at all the time. Let's see if there's people are resistant to getting rid of them, then I suggest to do a trial to get rid of it on 7th Avenue trial. And you will see that it's not going to cause more traffic into the neighborhoods. The neighborhoods already have have signs for people not to come into them, just as is. I also even have a picture of a police officer who was in the wrong lane at the wrong time. So that was very interesting. And then I did put a Facebook post out for the royal Palm neighborhood to kind of get a take of how do they feel about it? And it was pretty much 50 50. Some people liked it, and then there was a lot of people who didn't like. And then I asked them, how would they feel if another neighborhood outside their area made decisions on their neighborhood, on how they should live? And to me, that's just how can we force another neighborhood for our, for us to have speed, to get somewhere? So I just want to make it vocal that I think it's time to get rid of the reverse lanes. With all the people working from home now, it's just not needed anymore. And let's let everybody have a community and be vibrant. Thank you. Thank you so much.

Councilwoman Hodge. Washington. Here. Councilwoman O'Brien. Councilwoman pastor. Councilman Robinson. Here. Councilman Waring. Vice Mayor Stark. Here. Mayor Gallego. Here. Thank you so much for joining us today. We'll begin with council information and follow up requests. We'll begin with the vice mayor and then we'll go to Councilwoman Hud Washington. Thank you, mayor. And this will be very short, but I want to pay tribute to Lavi Borenstein. She was the founder of chompies along with her husband, and she passed away a couple days ago. I will tell you, I've spoken to many people that have grown up in district three and remember the original chompies. As a matter of fact, I think one of your staffers actually went to Shadow Mountain. He talked about how they would skip lunch, skip school so they could go to Chompy's and get a cookie from lovely. So I think she's just a wonderful woman. Sorry that she passed away. But as we all know, Chompies is an institution in the city of Phoenix. And so it's with great honor that I can say I knew her. And I will continue, of course, to go to Chompy's. Thank you, mayor. Thank you so much. February 14, 2022 was Chompy's 43rd anniversary and Borenstein family appreciation day in the city of Phoenix. It has been wonderful to hear from so many folks who were impacted by lovey. We'll go next to Councilwoman Hodge Washington and then councilwoman Guardado. Thank you, mayor. Since our last policy meeting, I've been on the move around district eight and I just want to highlight a few of the things that I've been working on. Next slide. It was an honor to commemorate a legend in district eight with the unveiling of a ceremonial sign for Vernell Myers Coleman at 7th Avenue and Buckeye Road. As a community advocate for more than 40 years, she worked to improve the lives of people living in poverty in Phoenix. She is remembered for reviving the celebration of Juneteenth in Phoenix, instrumental in helping to organize St. Mary's Food bank and so much more. Also, I served as a judge for the future Star STEM competition held at the South Mountain Community College in my district. The event is for middle and high school students. It was designed to provide an opportunity for them to explore coding through physical computing. They created and designed a STEM solution and presented their project to the community. It was an impressive gathering of students. Also as part of the Final Four events, one of the most established neighborhoods with a rich history took center court as the NCW NCAA dedicated their legacy project at East Lake park and Community center. Later in the week, I took a private tour with NCAA president Charlie Baker of the Eastlake Community center and it was so nice to showcase the gem in our community. Next slide please. Believe it or not, the NCAA was not the only game in town. I was excited to celebrate opening day with the Phoenix Mercury in the historic warehouse district. The Suns and the Mercury are an important part of our community and opening a new team member campus not too far from the arena will bring new energy and contribute to the revitalization of the warehouse district in Phoenix. From collaboration spaces to Pickleball, the space has it all and I'm so thrilled that it's in district eight this weekend, Miss Juneteenth, Arizona Sasha Revron invited me to be a panelist at the Teen Engage conference 2024. This impressive group of young gathered together early on a Saturday morning to work towards their goal of inspiring the next generation of the civically engaged. I also attended three community budget hearing, a community wide hearing, the community wide bilingual hearing and the hearing held in my district. I learned a lot from our community and look forward to working on a budget that meets the needs as best as we can. Next slide on Saturday, April 6, I also co hosted an event with Zion Institute for a free community event with free books, entertainment, resources, creative workshops and much more. It was a fun event with empowering Arizona Transformative justice, Zion Institute and the Phoenix Metropolitan Alumni chapter. Finally, I attended the Levine and South Mountain Community Picnic at Ashley's Backyard charity Tovar, along with the Levine Community Council. South Mountain and Levine Chamber of Commerce and Armadillo Ranch did an excellent job of hosting an event that has the perfect balance of unity, resources and fun. Next slide please. My staff and I are looking forward to the upcoming events we will be participating in for the remainder of this month and next month.

Thank you to the Carnation association of Neighborhoods for hosting next slide. Chispa, Arizona is hosting an Earth Day festival at Celitho park next Saturday and if you have any questions, you can always contact my office. I also want to recognize Monica Villalobos and congratulate her in her marriage this past weekend. So thank you. Thank you. I wanted to start with a quick thank you to those involved in producing the Phoenix History video series. A group of dedicated residents contributed their time and effort to chronicle the history of our great city. Thank you to council member Jacob Butler of the Salt River Pima Maricopa indian community, Jared Riddle, Regina Best, Andrea Barrera, Mark Tobo, Anthony Pratcher II, our city staff and our mayor's office historian, Steve Schumacher. It's been a big news week for the city of Phoenix and the state of Arizona. Yesterday, President Biden announced $6.6 billion in Chips act funding for TSMC in district one in Phoenix. They also announced their intentions to build a new fab facility a third one to make the world's most advanced microchips two nanometer. So small it's hard to describe. It's extremely impactful and will mean great jobs and prosperity for families for generations to come. We think it is the largest foreign direct investment in a greenfield project in the United States history at $65 billion. I want to congratulate Sky Harbor Airport on winning the employer of the year award from women in transportation. Some tougher news today. This morning, the state supreme court took us back in time by 160 years when they upheld the 1864 territorial abortion ban. This is devastating to so many families. Phoenix is a pro choice city. We believe women should be able to make their own healthcare decisions. They should be able to decide when and if they start a family. When Roe was overturned, this council voted to work with our police chief to deprioritize any calls related to abortion law violations. That policy still applies. While this ruling is dark, we can't use hope, and we call upon our lawmakers to defend women's most basic rights. Any additional updates before we move on? Right. Item number one is the expenditure limit task force. I want to thank our task force chairwoman, Monica Villalobos. Rachel. Aha. Todd Sanders, Brian Willingham, and the late Robin Reed. This is not the first time many of you have served our community, even in this capacity, and I want to thank you for your service. So I want to take a moment to honor Robin Reed, the CEO of the Black Chamber of Arizona and a good friend to so many across our community. Robin went above and beyond, whether in business, education, or just being a friend. He was a champion for Phoenix in our region. He saw the hope and promise in our city, and we will all work to carry on Robin's legacy of service to others in community. We are so sorry to have lost him. We'll next turn to our budget and research director, Amber Williamson, to introduce this important topic. Thank you, mayor, members of the council, and residents, I am pleased to be here today with our city expenditure limit task force chairwoman, Monica Villalobos, deputy budget research director Erin Mertz. They'll be helping me to present this item today. So, council, the state expenditure limitation item is a constitutional amendment that was approved by the voters of Arizona in 1980. It restricts spending for cities and towns to levels based in 1979 to 80, adjusted only for two factors, population and inflation. We received the population factors straight from the state demographer's office, and the inflation factors are provided to us from the Arizona Department of Revenue. They rely on the National Economic Bureau of analysis, through the United States gross domestic product implicit price deflator. Those factors are what's used to calculate our annual spending limit. As you know, Phoenix is the fifth largest city in the country. We've grown considerably since 1980. We're a regional leader. It's for these reasons we're not able to meet that strict formulaic limit. City of Phoenix expenditure growth across all city departments and funds exceeds those population and inflation factors. In order for the city to comply, we would have to reduce our annual expenditures across all city departments and funds by an estimated $2 billion. This represents about 30% of the total city operating budget. If the city does not comply with the state spending limit or have the voters approve an alternative, there would be a noncompliance penalty based on state statute. That penalty is estimated to be one third of our state shared income tax revenue. As a reminder, state shared income tax revenue is allocated 100% to our general fund. We're estimating that would be a loss in revenue of $120 million in fiscal year 25 26. I'm now going to hand over the presentation to Erin Mertz, who's going to walk through the options that the task force considered to recommend to the city, as well as a history of how city Phoenix has complied with the state law. Thank you, mayor. Members of the council, as Amber mentioned, there are three main alternatives that cities and towns can use as an alternative to the formulaic state limit that she just discussed. The first is the alternative expenditure limitation, otherwise known as the home rule option. This must be approved by voters at a regularly scheduled general election of the members of the governing board.

Thank you, mayor. Members of the council, as Amber mentioned, there are three main alternatives that cities and towns can use as an alternative to the formulaic state limit that she just discussed. The first is the alternative expenditure limitation, otherwise known as the home rule option. This must be approved by voters at a regularly scheduled general election of the members of the governing board. It's good for four years if approved by voters, and any and all expenditures may be exempted. The next option is known as the permanent base adjustment. This permanently increases the base limit for the calculation of a city's annual spending limit. It would only grow thereafter by the inflation and population factors that Amber just mentioned. It must be for a specific dollar amount, and it's worth noting that it may not truly be permanent if cities growth eventually exceeded that new permanent base that was adopted. There's one other option that is available, known as the one time override. This is effective only for one year. It's really designed for things like a natural or man made disaster, and it must also be for a specific dollar amount similar to the permanent base adjustment. But again, because of the one year timeframe, it really prevents it from being a long term solution. As far as the city's history with alternative expenditure limitations, Phoenix voters have approved a home rule option ten times since 1981. Now, in the 1980s and the early 1990s, that home rule option exempted certain enterprise funds, and that allowed the city to stay below the state expenditure limit. As Amber mentioned, we're now projecting to be roughly $2 billion over the formulaic limit. And so even if we were to exempt the enterprise funds, such as aviation, water, and wastewater, we would still be over the limit. So since 1999, excuse me, the limit has been set at the council approved, adopted balanced budget every year. I will also note that there were two permanent base adjustments that were presented to voters, once in 1985, once in 1997, but both of those were rejected by voters. So the city has a long and successful history with the home rule option. The city also has a long history of using members of the community to provide input and insight into this process. And so we have, as Amber mentioned, Monica Villalobos here today. She is the chair of the expenditure limit Task force, and she will tell you a little bit more about the work of the task force and how they arrived at their recommendation. Thank you so much, Mayor Gallego, members of the council, thank you for this opportunity. Councilwoman pastor, thank you very much for the congratulatory note. No one was more surprised that someone wanted to marry me than me. So I appreciate that. With regard to the expenditure limit, Task Force Phoenix is not required to, but appoints a citizens task force, such as the one formed this year to recommend an approach to the expenditure expenditure limit committee. Four citizen members with strong mix of public sector, private sector, and nonprofit experience, all are very comfortable and have been very comfortable reviewing the city's finances and studying the impact of the state expenditure limit. I'd also like to take a point of privilege to recognize my colleague, my friend Robin Reed. Thank you, Mayor Gallego, for recognizing his contributions to this. We missed him on this task force, but we forged ahead the way he would have wanted us to. With regard to the. Oh, see, you have animation. You guys are fancy. Okay. Sorry. You want to drive for me? Absolutely. Thank you. We held three meetings and devoted time outside of the meetings to studying the issue and analyzing city funds and final financial forecasts. The first two meetings focused on learning about the state spending limit, learning the city's history with the expenditure limit and previous options selected, studying and asking questions about staff prepared forecast for city funds, including the general fund. The third meeting was spent discussing the available options merits of an alternative expenditure limit or home rule option versus the permanent base adjustment, and recommending an option. The task force worked with staff after the third meeting to finalize our report and recommended ballot options. After reviewing the options available, the task force members voted unanimously to recommend continuation of an alternative spending limitation or home rule option, which establishes the expenditure limit at an adopted budget and that it be presented to the city council and voters. Further, as in the past, we also recommend the city continue its practice of engaging residents in the annual budget process to ensure each fiscal year's budget reflects the needs of the community. The basis for this recommendation to continue a home rule option is it provides the needed flexibility, transparency and annual involvement of residents in setting the spending limit. The home rule option supports local control and affirms Phoenix's longstanding open budget process, resulting in a balanced and responsive annual budget. Another key benefit of the home rule option was the requirement for another review by an independent task force and vote of Phoenix residents four years from now.

The home rule option supports local control and affirms Phoenix's longstanding open budget process, resulting in a balanced and responsive annual budget. Another key benefit of the home rule option was the requirement for another review by an independent task force and vote of Phoenix residents four years from now. The task force considered the permanent base adjustment and one time override options, but determine these options would not provide the flexibility the city requires to continue existing programs and services or to expand those services in the future based on community input and engagement. The permanent base adjustment was not recommended because it would require a significant increase to cover the city's current level of expenditures and it may be confusing to voters. Additionally, as the report indicates, it may not be truly permanent. If the city exceeded the permanent base adjustment in the future, it would require voter action to adjust the limit again. Also, unlike the home rule option, this option does not provide the annual community involvement for an independent citizens task force, and two prior attempts at this option failed in 1985 and 1997. The one time override was not recommended, as it is only for one year and for the purposes of covering costs due to a natural or man made disaster. This option also must be for a specific amount, so if it is a poor fit, it is a poor fit as a replacement to the home rule option. The home rule option accommodates new taxes approved by voters since 1979 to 1980 for programs such as parks, preserves, public safety and transit services. The home rule option also allows for key regional services to continue. These services have outpaced the Phoenix population and inflation. For example, Sky harbor airport is funded by fees paid by the airlines and passengers and provides airports, but serves the entire region. It serves almost seven times more passengers than in 1980. New enhancements like the Phoenix Skytrain and the rental car center aren't included in the original expenditure limit calculation, but benefit both Phoenix and valleywide residents. Other city departments also provide vital regional services such as public transit through light rail and bus services. Other important city services such as water and wastewater and solid waste have implemented significant environmental and security mandates and expanded to meet the needs of the fifth largest city in the country. The city simply cannot provide the current level of expected services under the state imposed limit as we reviewed budgets for other cities. Believe me when I tell you that Phoenix runs a tight fiscal ship. I'd like to congratulate our city manager and staff for meeting the rapidly growing needs of Phoenix effectively and efficiently. In summary, the home rule option protects important community services at existing levels and provides for future growth. Accounts for the fact that Phoenix is a leader for the entire region. Beyond Phoenix, residents preserves the city's commitment to a transparent, community engaged process that results in a balanced budget. Thank you for this opportunity to participate in this process. I'll pass it back to Amber. Thank you so much, Monica. So, council, today, upon approval of the task force recommendation, the next steps would be to set the two statutorily required public hearings. These would take place at formal council meetings on May 1 and May 15. Immediately following the second public hearing on May 15, council would adopt the resolution to refer an alternative expenditure limitation proposition to the voters. June 12, via ordinance, council would adopt the form of the ballot. The election will take place on November 5. So today, council, we are asking for action to accept the task force recommendation to approve an alternative spending limit. Home rule option where the annual spending limit would be set at the adopted balance budget only. After obtaining community feedback, we would set the public hearing dates for May 1 and May 15. This would also authorize staff to take the steps that are necessary to prepare for the November 5 election. That concludes our presentation and we can answer any questions. Thank you, Director Williamson and chairwoman and the entire team who worked on this, including the citizen committee. There's going to be very important stuff on the ballot. This may be one of the least understood, but most important, local government will be at the bottom of the ballot. If you're watching, you already know local government is important, but we sure hope people make it the whole way on the very long November ballot. I've moved forward in this area for the last quarter century, and essential services will be so deeply impacted by this item. Vice mayor, do we have a motion? Yes, mayor I make the following recommendations that we accept the task force recommendation. We approve home rule option with the annual spending limit, which equals our adopted budget. We're going to set our public hearings for May 1 and 15th and authorize staff to take steps to prepare for the November 5, 2024 election. Second, we have a motion and a second.

It is an option that local revenues would be best spent with some oversight of the needs. And what I am suggesting to you as what you've said, mayor, on this ballot, it'll be important because I think it's 479. The regional transportation. We're going to need to have consistency in the reporting and the city, anything that the city is spending, particularly on this issue and any other department needs to be appropriately documented, because if we were going by the state constitution, it's my understanding that they wouldn't allow, you know, these federal and state monies to be combined. But we're using federal and state, I guess, as far as our revenues and if it's reported here and at Mag Valley Metro in the instance of transportation, it needs to be consistent. Thank you. Thank you so much. Council member, questions or comments? Councilwoman Guardado? Thank you, Mayor. I would like to thank the task force chairwoman Villalobos. Thank you so much for your leadership, city manager Jeff Barton and Amber and the budget research department for their work on this item. Your input and support in this matter are important as we navigate through these important budget decisions. It is crucial that we comply with the state expenditure limit, and I support the task force's recommendation to refer to the voters an alternative spending limit, also known as the home rule option, on this upcoming ballot in November. By voting in favor of this measure, we are securing our city's financial stability. Failure to pass this measure could result in a substantial penalty imposed by the state, reducing revenue to the city and jeopardizing our ability to continue important general fund programs and services for our residents. Thank you, mayor. Thank you. The importance of home rule cannot be overstated. Looks like we are ready for a vote. All those in favor, please say aye. Any opposed? Nay. Aye. Passes unanimously. Thank you so much for all the hard work that has happened and the hard work to come. Item two is the appointment for an interim council member for council district seven. The city charter states that when a vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining in the term, the city council must appoint an individual to fill the vacancy until a special election can be held. The last time the appointment process occurred was under the late mayor Thelda Williams. In the words of my predecessor, serving on the Phoenix City council is an awesome responsibility. It takes courage to put your name in the ring and resolve to be willing to serve. Thank you to each candidate for answering the call to serve to public service as outlined by the city charter and the memo sent to the city manager on March 23. The candidates will be called today in alphabetical order by last name, and each will have five minutes to address the council and the audience after the candidates have spoken. Members of the public may have up to two minutes to speak, and council members have the opportunity to ask questions of the candidates. The council member will then vote to select the interim district seven council member as allowed by the charter. Any council member may nominate any qualified individual to fill the vacancy with no second required. The council will vote on the candidates in the order in which they were nominated, and the first candidate to receive an affirmative majority of the votes of the council members present will be selected to fill the vacancy. The interim council member will take office as soon as the oath of the office of office has been administered and signed, and will serve, depending on the results of the special election, and I will turn to the city clerk to walk us through the two possible timelines. Mayor members of the public council Mayor Gallego this particular interim council appointment serves from the time the person is appointed through the canvas of the vote for the November 5 election. During the November 5 election, there will be a special election. That election will be for a person to be selected by the voters to fill the remainder of the council district seven term currently, and that will be that person will either serve from the canvas of the vote for the November election, which is currently scheduled for November 20, through the end of the current term, which is April 21 of 2025, 10:00 a.m. or if. If no candidate receives 50% plus one of the votes at the November 5 election for the special election, then the top two vote getters will go to a runoff and the runoff election. Canvas of the vote is currently scheduled for March 26, and therefore the person will serve from the day after March 26 through April 21 of 2023 for approximately three and a half weeks. Thank you so much. The city clerk received submissions from four candidates, the first of which is Gilbert Arvisu. So we will ask Mister Arviso to come forward. He will be followed by Carlos.

Thank you so much. The city clerk received submissions from four candidates, the first of which is Gilbert Arvisu. So we will ask Mister Arviso to come forward. He will be followed by Carlos. All right, thank you, mayor. I'm going to be as brief as possible, as you all have access to my letter of interest and resume, which I would encourage you to skim over as I speak. As I mentioned in those documents, my family has a rich 100 year history serving downtown and south of Phoenix, and I continue those efforts to this day. I am not here on a whim. In what was submitted to you, I talked about my extensive leadership chairing the programming of one of Phoenix's largest health and housing providers, coordinating a coalition of dozens of community organizations to address health related social needs, and much more, most notably for district seven. I was in the DC office when John McCain announced his vision for the Rio Salado building on the foundation laid by many local leaders, and when his staff learned that his only intern from Arizona had roots in South Phoenix, I was told I had no choice but to be involved. I still remember the day going back and forth on what we should call this project, this vision for South Phoenix, a historically disconnected community from the rest. And we settled on Rio reimagined, which was approved in the recent bond election and thus community engagement. Efforts by staff are ongoing and I'm ready to step in and help with those efforts. But I want to highlight something that does not make the limelight but will be critical for this appointment, the ability to answer the phones and respond to mail, demonstrating that I can readily respond to these requests from constituents. I want to give you a very recent example. A neighborhood in downtown Phoenix had asked for updated resident permit parking signs last year for the Super bowl and World Series. The signs were faded, unrecognizable, and therefore people were parking in their neighborhood, causing safety concerns for this neighborhood where they lived, worked and played. Their request to replace the signs went unnoticed. When it came time for the final four, I made my concerns known to the host committee and city staff and worked with the neighborhood to get all the signs replaced, outdoing expectations as the signs now reflect light at night, the complete opposite of what the neighborhood had. And the neighborhood was ecstatic. What seems like a day to day activity to a community leader is a major win, even for the most overlooked neighborhoods, and I am ready to continue this leadership engagement and great work to advance our shared goals together. And I'll just note that in the picture that councilman pastor put up of Cesar Chavez, he was wearing a button down shirt and that is why I wear button down shirts. So thank you. Thank you so much. Carlos is next, followed by Michael, Mayor Gallego, vice mayor Stark and council members, thank you for the opportunity to make my case for the council district interim appointment. I reside, work and vote in district seven. Our family has lived in the district for more than 20 years. I have a history of working in the nonprofit arena, ranging from engaging community partners, leading anti hate advocacy, and co creating leadership development programs. My experience also includes serving as a YMCA childcare manager, special assistant to a United States senator, and as a voter outreach coordinator in Pnow County. I was born and raised in Arizona's copper corridor, which is at the heart of the state of Arizona. And that's where I gained the values instilled in me about caring for neighbors. Courtesy costs nothing and community is everything. It's these values that will inform my services as a council member for the city of Phoenix. Additionally, I served as mayor for the town of Hayden, along with being elected twice as a council member and also served as vice mayor. I've publicly made three pledges. The first, to not run for the district seven full term council seat in the upcoming November election. Two, the salary earned from this interim appointment will be reinvested into district seven, except for my employer, to advance, support and aid for nonprofit agencies and clearly, to support residents. Third, I will fiercely protect the nonpartisan role of the district office and responsibly assist all residents, regardless of party affiliation. The decision to submit my name for the appointment came with the deliberation and with this approach that's crucial in both leading and serving on for the public good. It came down to three things for me, connecting, communicating and creating. I know there will be tough and difficult issues to address and votes to cast as part of the job in these instances and in my life as a whole. There's a verse I lean into from joshua be strong and have a good courage. And it's the word good that strengthens me the most. Be assured that when it's time to take a stand, I won't be shy. I'm not a perfect person, but I will try to be a responsive public servant and I'll be respectful to all. We may disagree on certain or most issues, that's okay. It's part of the democratic process. However, it doesn't mean that I'll dismiss or dim", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Gilbert Arvisu", "insights": [{"observation": "Extensive leadership chairing the programming of one of Phoenix's largest health and housing providers, coordinating a coalition of dozens of community organizations to address health related social needs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Efforts by staff are ongoing and I'm ready to step in and help with those efforts.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Worked with the neighborhood to get all the signs replaced, outdoing expectations as the signs now reflect light at night.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Carlos", "insights": [{"observation": "History of working in the nonprofit arena, ranging from engaging community partners, leading anti hate advocacy, and co creating leadership development programs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The salary earned from this interim appointment will be reinvested into district seven, to advance, support and aid for nonprofit agencies and support residents.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Pledged to fiercely protect the nonpartisan role of the district office and responsibly assist all residents, regardless of party affiliation.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Connecting, communicating and creating.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Gilbert Arvisu", "insights": [{"observation": "Extensive leadership chairing the programming of one of Phoenix's largest health and housing providers, coordinating a coalition of dozens of community organizations to address health related social needs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Efforts by staff are ongoing and I'm ready to step in and help with those efforts.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Worked with the neighborhood to get all the signs replaced, outdoing expectations as the signs now reflect light at night.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Carlos", "insights": [{"observation": "History of working in the nonprofit arena, ranging from engaging community partners, leading anti hate advocacy, and co creating leadership development programs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The salary earned from this interim appointment will be reinvested into district seven, to advance, support and aid for nonprofit agencies and support residents.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Pledged to fiercely protect the nonpartisan role of the district office and responsibly assist all residents, regardless of party affiliation.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Connecting, communicating and creating.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1960200, "chunk_end_time": 2365934, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/Dd49UWrewPQ?si=oKvG61OtBZCQb5JG", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/Dd49UWrewPQ?si=oKvG61OtBZCQb5JG&t=1960s"}, {"start": 34000, "end": 40000, "text": "rly, to support residents.

However, it doesn't mean that I'll dismiss or diminish you as a person with a different viewpoint to mine. On public policy, my concerns are a direct reflection that residents ask me to be addressed. Crime, public crime, public safety, heat resiliency, homelessness, and parks and recreation. I don't underestimate the power of using one's voice or joining with other voices to get things done. The same applies to joining forces to move forward on critical issues. I will seek out and invite others to join me, roll up our sleeves and get to work. People want results and they deserve to have them. I will work with anyone who acts in good faith to work on and find solutions to issues impacting residents of district seven. As a whole city, I believe my record of direct constituents assistance, nonpartisan elected office and service to community makes me well suited to serve the residents of district seven and I thank you for your kind consideration. Thank you. Michael Nowakowski is next, followed by Lisa. Mayor, councilmembers, thank you for this opportunity. About 30 years ago, my wife Delia and I were looking for a place to live, and we decided on district seven. We have six children, five boys and one girl. And we have a new member of our family, a grandson that's going to be one years old in May. You know, this whole leadership came from really my father. My father's here right now. He's 90 years old. And he was a leap commissioner. And from that experience, I knew that service to others was something very important and something that ran into Nowakowski blood. I believe I'm the only applicant that's really qualified with 13 years of serving as the council member of district seven. I was voted in three times by the residency, a district seven to serve that district. There's no one else that you're going to interview today that has that 13 years of experience, 13 years of good times, bad times, heartaches and all kinds of in betweens. You know, one of the things I want to do today is really focus on our staff. Also, I remember coming in as a new council member back in 2008. We're going through an economic downturn, and we had to cut and cut and cut. And it was our staff members that we sat down with. And at that time, I think Deborah Starks was actually one of those staff members that we sat down and we said, you know, we're going to have to make some, some cuts to all of our budgets, about 20%. And you all help us be a part of this process. We reached out to the community and we asked the same thing. Can you all help us out? And sure enough, that miracle happened that everybody started to give in. Everybody started to work together. Our staff was willing to go on furloughs and give up some of their time. And thank God that at the end of my term, I was able to pay back all those great staff members that gave up that time and those efforts, all those furlough and raises in between, we were able to give you some back. So thank you all. And I think that's what Phoenix is all about. I always said that we were a team, and it's really about a team Phoenix approach with our staff, with the council members that we have. And hopefully I would be that next person up there to help out. But I think it's about leadership. You need an individual that will lead, an individual that will sit people down from different walks of life and different opinions and try to find that common ground. And that's one of the things that I'm good at, trying to find that common ground. It might not be a win win for everyone, but at least we were able to sit down and have that conversation and do what was best, not for those individuals or not for myself, but for the city of Phoenix. And that's what leadership's all about. And I believe right now that's what district seven needs more and all. I was just driving down Central Avenue with my son, Michael Ray, taking him to ASU. It's his last year, and then hopefully he's going to be going into law school next year. But one of the things he said is, dad, the street's still all torn up, the light rail isn't built yet. I go, no, son. And he goes, why? I go, that's a good question. I'll ask, maybe I'll ask some of the council members when I go and get interviewed on Monday or Tuesday. But, you know, to think about it, we need to be out there in the community telling them why. Why is it that we don't have a hospital south of the river? Why is it that we don't have a movie theater yet south of the river? Why is it that we don't have places for our families to sit down and eat? Why is that? We need to answer those questions. Why haven't we built that tech corridor that we promised the Estrella mountain individuals that we were going to do so that people can work and live and play in the communities that they live in? I'm going to continue being that champion for public safety, for economic development, and I believe that I'm the best choice for this position because I have that experience of 13 years that I have the compassion and I would make sure tha", "esg_v1": [{"name": "District Office", "insights": [{"observation": "I will fiercely protect the nonpartisan role of the district office and responsibly assist all residents, regardless of party affiliation.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "I will be respectful to all.

So with that, thank you and God bless. Thank you. Lisa Perez is our next and final speaker. Good afternoon, Mayor, vice mayor, members of the council, thank you for the opportunity this afternoon. Coming to this decision about putting my name up for district seven was a very hard one for me. I do community service and I'm involved with my community because I want to be. Not for the pats on the back and the thank yous and the, oh, geez, you did something great here. It's because I want to do something to improve my community. That's it. Quality of life for myself and my neighbors. That's what drives me to be so involved in my community, I do want to say what Michael said is exactly right. One of the things that's most important to me is bringing in the services and the amenities in district seven. I know that there's parts of us, us community activists, who people are saying, all you guys do is whine about stuff, but the reality is, being in southwest Phoenix, we're the furthest south I touch. Avondale and Tollison, we don't have very many services. We just don't. We have to drive anywhere to go shopping. We have to. We don't have very good metro, so people can't take buses anywhere. It is a place that does need some. Some improvement in some more infrastructure. One of the reasons I decided to run and put my name in, it was just to put my name in. I wanted community activists across the city to know that your voice matters and saying something out loud is okay, even if we disagree that it's still important to have the conversation and to be willing to let it go once a decision has been made. There was a recent zoning case in my area that I was pretty furious about. Council approved it, had to let it go. There has to be a bigger picture item for why the council chose to do that in my community. And I have to respect that. It's as simple as that. We know that the person who serves in district seven answers to the constituents that they serve, but have to be in mind, keep in mind that the city overall, it has to be the priority. And I understand that, and it's important, and this council person will have to do that. I would like to follow a little bit of what councilman office was very helpful. I didn't know her when she ran for office, but she has been. Was responsive, she was passionate about issues. And if she disagreed, she didn't hesitate to pick up the phone and say, so sorry, not going to happen. And I appreciated that the respect that she had for the community and the respect that she had for myself and others showed. And I would like to make sure that anybody who has that wants to have that relationship with the council member, that they should, and they should always feel free to ask the question. We may not agree, we may disagree, but I think it's important. Those of you that don't know me, most of you know me. I serve right now in the city of Phoenix Planning commission, which is something I wanted to do the very first time I saw my packet. I passed out and. But it has been. It's gonna sound weird. It's been a joy. I have learned so much from being on the planning commission, I've learned about other places within the city. I've had the opportunity to talk with individuals who are fighting as far up as an anthem area, but getting to talk to them and hearing their side about it has been very interesting and has been really quite a pleasure. So I've had contacts all over the city now that I get to work with on issues that come up because for me and for them, those zoning cases are about their quality of life and they should be heard one way or another. And it's important. A couple things I just want to mention. I also serve on the Estrella village planning committee. I've had the privilege of serving on the go bond committee a couple years ago and then what was formerly known as the Electric Vehicle Task force. All of which has been just amazing opportunities to be able to learn more about the city and the individuals that I got to serve with, which was important to me. Lastly, my community service also stems from me being an older mother. We'll just leave it like that. I have a 13 year old, had him late in life, but I want my child to learn civic responsibility, that it's his job to give back as much as he gets. And he's an only child. So I mean, let's tell you what it's like. He doesn't have an only child. Maybe he's a little bit spoiled, I'll be honest, and I enable that, which is not good, but I want him to understand it. So he's out there with me for cleanups, setting up my tents for gain events. He's out there when I go to speak at things. I'm going to drag him to the budget meetings this week because I want him to understand the opportunities that even as kids, how you can get involved and why it's important to be involved in your community.

Always speak out on the issues that are important to you. Your voice does matter and we need a council person who is going to stick up for everybody in the community and for the city of Phoenix. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Thank you so much. All of the applicants have volunteered so much time with our city and our community and we want to thank you for your commitment to a better Phoenix. That concludes the applicants. And then we will go to public comment. We'll begin with Oscar, followed by Ansimus. Good afternoon. My name is Oscar. I live in the district. I'm one of 200,000 constituents from district seven. To me, this is a no brainer. You got somebody that's got 13 years experience, a former council member versus other individuals, which they all sound good. They all have a lot things going for them. You have a former mayor of Hayden with a population of 600 people versus 200,000. To me, it seems like this is going to be a four month interim. What better position would it be than to have Michael with experience go in there than having to train somebody or teach somebody the ropes? You know, you have somebody that served on a school board. Do they have that experience with the city? And you have the other candidate that my notes here that ran for a race in district eight, and now he wants to represent district seven. My question is, what district does he live in? The boundaries may have been redone, I'm not sure, but that, that's a question that needs to be answered. And so I'm an advocate for Mister Nowakowski. Thank you. Thank you. Anissimus is next. Hi, mayor. Hi, council people. Thank you for having me. Thank you for having me today. I know the last time I spoke to you, I probably had two minutes. I don't see a clock running. Oh, it is running well. I am here in support of Michael Nowakowski for the appointment to District seven. I'm invested heavily in that area of help. A lot of candidates campaign in that area in district eight, District seven for LD Senate as well as LD House. I know the community very well and have spoken to a lot of the residents and voters of District seven. So a lot of the issues I understand fully. Michael has represented that community and has addressed a lot of their issues over the years and has done a very good job, including also the entire city of Phoenix from an economic standpoint, with the development of the downtown corridor, helping with the cotton center development, with South Phoenix and the Levine build out, there's more to be done. We're in a new era right now as a city. It's a fast developing, fast growing city, and it has posed some major challenges. Michael Nowakowski has demonstrated the ability to collaborate with colleagues like yourself to be able to move forward with, with a combined mission for all of Phoenix. He will come back in this interim period of time, I'm sure, and support each and every one of you in getting things done that you need for your residents and community. I have a lot of confidence and trust in him. I first got to know him at Levine Little league baseball, wherein his family participated over the years and grew up there. And I was a coach for one of the teams every year. So I've had an opportunity to observe him, talk to him, learn from him, and I think he'll be a great addition to this council in this time to continue to work and move things forward as you seek to or as the community seek to elect someone. Please think favorably to appoint Miss Nialakowski. Thank you. Thank you so much. That concludes public comment. We'll now go to council member questions, and we'll begin with Councilman Kevin Robinson. Mayor, thank you very much. And I trust you can hear me okay beautifully. Okay. Thank you very much. I'm sorry I could not be there, but as you know, my wife and I are on our way to Portugal to celebrate our anniversary and her birthday, and. But I know how important this particular process is, so I want to be a part of it. The first question I have, and it's for all, actually, for three of the candidates, because I think Mister Galindo, Alvira, and I apologize if I'm saying the name wrong. I think he made it very clear that he is not seeking to run for the office permanently. But the other three candidates, Mister Arbizu, Mister Noah Kowski and Miss Perez, can I hear from each of them whether or not they plan to seek the position permanently? Wonderful. So we'll do alphabetical order, if that works again, and then I'll go reverse alphabetical order next time. So for Mister Arbiso, do you plan to run for the four year term? Say it to the microphone. So perfect. No, in my letter of interest, I'm not running for special. Any of the elections or the. Or the different options that there are. Thank you.

Council member Robinson, this is Michael Milachowski. I remember. Happy wife, happy life. So you're doing the right thing. And I am running for this position. I'm running for the special election and I'm going to be running for the four year. Thank you, mayor. Members of the council. Councilmember Robinson, this is Lisa Perez. I have put my name in for this special election, and I kind of want to explain why right now. The way that this election is going to go. Whoever gets appointed today will only serve until November. If somebody wins a special election, it would be a different person, and then whoever is running for the full term, if that's a different person. So district seven has a chance of having three different representatives within one year, which is not really great. I put my name in for special election, I have not made a full decision about whether or not I'm going to run for the full term. I am discussing that with friends and colleagues, but I'm leaning towards it because I do want to see some continuity. Thank you very much. Okay, well, thank all of you for your answers. I do appreciate that. The reason I asked that particular question is that I think it is critical that the voters in district seven pick their representative. And clearly this is something we are doing, bounded by charter. We're picking someone to fill a vacancy for a short amount of time. I think it's going to be critical for the residents within district seven to pick that person. So I will leave it at that. For that particular question. I do want to ask another question, Mister Nowakowski, it's more for you. And you had mentioned in your presentation that you want to do what was best for the city of Phoenix. You mentioned you had served in good and bad times. And I'm not trying to be a stick in the mud or anything along those lines, but I know how important these positions are. I understand how politicians are viewed these days, and I think it's critical to be beyond reproachful. Could you expound a little bit? Because I know there was an issue surrounding you and some ethical dealings when you were in office before, and I think it's important for us to understand your position on that, where you stood. And I know things were discontinued because then city manager Zuerker removed the issue from sale of property and such. But can you tell us why we should vote for you with having that in your background? What exactly are you talking about? I know that there was a question of insider, I used the word insider trading, for lack of a better word, but there were some issues with some land dealings with your employer, with you, and a host of things. It's in the papers. It was in the papers, I should say. Right. So I would think that you should remember that. I remember it very well. So, Councilmember Robinson, it went all the way to the Supreme Court and they dismissed it, saying that there is no evidence and they don't even know how it actually got to the Supreme Court. So it was a lot of inside politics that was going on. My employer at that time was the Cesar Chavez foundation. They were trying to build some affordable housing in downtown Phoenix. I run the radio aspect of the Cesar Chavez Foundation. I have nothing to do with the housing aspect of it. So basically somebody tried to make it seem a developer that lost a bit, try to make it seem like I had some insight information to actually help out the Cesar Chavez foundation with that. If you want to go into more details, we could, there's a bidding chart that you have where you get points and the point system is if you were going to be, if you would pay for the land outright. And they said yes. After I reviewed it, they actually, the scoring was really that Chavez Foundation, I think it was Trammell Crow or something like that, that put in for that, that they basically out scored the rest of the individuals and basically the person that came in second place that was upset about this whole system, I mean, situation. And that brought it out to the media to try to throw out a new bid in which they were successful on and took it to court, basically wanted to create condos instead of affordable housing and rental property. So that's why they really lost a bid because they didn't follow the scope of the RFP. So if you'd like to go into more detail, I think you can ask your staff to give you the whole scoring and the whole detail and then you'll figure it out yourself. Okay, well, thank you for that. Again, I asked the question, like I said, not trying to be a stick in the mud or anything like that. I just think it's critical that we as the elected body, the folks who are going to choose, pick this person on a temporary basis. We have all the facts and know where you stood and what you understood, what your position was with it. I wasn't there. I was in the city at the time, I remember it and I'm sure others would too. And I think that's why I thought it was important for you to explain. And I thank you for your explanation. It is appreciated.

And that's exactly what happened there. Thank you. Thank you. And we would welcome the council member to stay near the microphone because I think there'll be a few additional questions if you, if you'd like. Council member Robinson. Well, thank you, mayor. Mister Noakowski, I get that. I do understand that. But you know, I think, like I said, having you explain it means a lot, definitely to me. And, you know, it's always that appearance of an impropriety that sticks with people. So it's good to hear your, you know, how it turned out and everything else because that may not have been known by a lot of folks. And I think that's important. And, mayor, the very last question I have for each one of the candidates is, have any of you had an opportunity to speak to former councilwoman Ansari? Wonderful. And I believe this time we'll go in reverse alphabetical order. So we would start with Perez. Lisa Perez, vice mayor, members of the council. Councilman Robinson, just an opportunity to speak with her in general or. Yes. The reason I ask this question for everyone, she was doing a wonderful job. She was voted in by the residents in district seven. I was just curious as to whether or not you had an opportunity to talk to her and to get a feel for what she was doing, what her thoughts were and that type of thing. I did reach out to her because I didn't want to put her in any kind of a weird position. But she, we were sad to see her leave. I'll be honest with you. She did the courtesy in a year before she, right before she announced, she called a few of us and we had dinner and we discussed it, and she told us that she felt the passion to go on. So I haven't talked to her about this. She may be watching. Her staff is watching right now, but I just didn't want to put her in a weird position. Thank you, council member Robinson. This is Michael Nowakowski. The last time I talked to the council member was actually at the Levine barbecue. I was the emcee for the cow milking that. Basically, she won that cow milking of Levine. So she's known as the queen of cow milking out for this year. And that was the last time I had a conversation with her. All right. Thank you, council member Robinson. This is Carlos Galindo. Elvira, before I answer, I'm going to wish you and your wife safe travel. I did not and have not spoken to council, former council member Ansari regarding the appointment or her role in office. Thank you, Councilman. This is Gilbert Arvizu. I have not spoken to the former councilwoman about this position. Thank you, Mister Arvizu. Mayor, that concludes the questions I have at this time. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Thank you, Councilwoman Hudge Washington. Thank you, mayor. I also have a few questions for the, for those that are interested. My first question is, I feel like you will be representing the constituents of district seven. I would like to hear, from your perspective, what are the major issues that you believe that district seven is facing, and what are your plans to address those? And then I have multiple questions. You want me to give them all now or multiple questions, assuming they are not so complicated that it would be unfair to. Yes. So it's not unfair. So the other question that I wanted to kind of tie in, one of the major issues right now, I think, that's facing district seven is the new proposed homeless shelter in that area, 75th Avenue and Van Buren. The reports are there is not complete neighborhood support for this, and I would love to hear what you plan on doing to help rectify that issue. Is it? Is it. So, two questions, general priorities, and then specific to the 71st Avenue. Great. And we will go in alphabetical order again. So I believe the two are actually connected. It has to do with community engagement. As I said in my speech, district seven, particularly south of the river, has been historically disconnected from the rest of Phoenix. And that is why I focused on engagement in my speech. So not going in there and telling folks, hey, this is what is good for you, but listening. Listening and responding to the needs of the community. And as I put in my letter of interest and in my resume, I focused on responding to the needs of the community. So, again, for that particular homeless shelter, I would go and engage the community. I engage the community at the 24th street in Washington shelter. I was there at all those meetings as connected to my employer. So I was there and heard the concerns there, and I'm willing to do the same for that location. And is there anything else you would like to add specifically about what you believe to be the major issues facing district seven and what you plan to do to address them? I believe the major issues as what h", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Unknown Company A", "insights": [{"observation": "Created condos instead of affordable housing and rental property, not following the scope of the RFP.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Homeless Shelter Project at 75th Avenue and Van Buren", "insights": [{"observation": "New proposed homeless shelter in the area does not have complete neighborhood support.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "General Observation on District Seven", "insights": [{"observation": "Focus on community engagement and responding to the needs of the community.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Historical disconnection from the rest of Phoenix, proposing to listen and respond to community needs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Unknown Company A", "insights": [{"observation": "Created condos instead of affordable housing and rental property, not following the scope of the RFP.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Homeless Shelter Project at 75th Avenue and Van Buren", "insights": [{"observation": "New proposed homeless shelter in the area does not have complete neighborhood support.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "General Observation on District Seven", "insights": [{"observation": "Focus on community engagement and responding to the needs of the community.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Historical disconnection from the rest of Phoenix, proposing to listen and respond to community needs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 3623142, "chunk_end_time": 4039880, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/Dd49UWrewPQ?si=oKvG61OtBZCQb5JG", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/Dd49UWrewPQ?si=oKvG61OtBZCQb5JG&t=3623s"}, {"start": 59000, "end": 65000, "text": " has to do with community engagement.

I believe the major issues as what has been talked about is the lack of services south of the river. There's no trauma one hospital. There are small hospitals south of the river. But I believe that is the biggest concern, is how can we get services to south of the river. And it was also mentioned earlier about amenities. These are topics that have been talked about for many, many years. We talked about with Rio reimagine how they're at central on the river bottom. Can we put a cultural plaza to recognize the residents of South Phoenix and their commitments to the rest of Phoenix? So I believe that is part of the problem. And again, it goes back to what I've been saying is this disconnection from the rest of Phoenix. Thank you. Council member Hodge Washington. Thank you for your question. There's so much related to each other in district seven, but I'm going to go first with the applicability of law enforcement, heat resiliency, and the shelter. I think what needs to happen is, yes, the community engagement with the neighborhood, but not community engagement as a checkoff point. It needs to be real and it needs to be culturally appropriate, as well as addressing it both in English and in Spanish because they're concerned about their children. On Sunday, I did take a drive out to the area and actually walked from the school to the proposed site area and found it that there was a safe distance. But that won't matter if we're not able to communicate that effectively to the neighborhood. And to get their input, they have ideas like, for example, there are going to be safeguards in place for the shelter because it won't be a walk up shelter. There will be behavioral services that will be provided. And we're heading into the hottest time of the year. 65% of this interim appointment takes place during the hottest time of the year. So all of those combined together are really important to address and to address it without being shy and to address it in a way that matters to the community, because once community is involved, they're invested in the success of project. This is Michael Nowakowski for councilmember Robinson. You know, district seven is really split up into five areas. We have the downtown area where, I mean, 16 years ago, you wouldn't have believed what you see now. And that was really because we worked together with the community, with individuals that had vested interests in downtown, from ASU to all the small businesses to the individuals that live downtown. And I believe that's what made downtown so special. And now what we see in downtown Phoenix, one of the biggest concerns that there was was having a grocery store, the food desert, especially in the downtown area, and in the, what do you call it, the Capitol Mall area. And we were able to, I was able to champion bringing Fry's supermarket downtown Phoenix. So that was some of the concerns in downtown safety for our students, making sure that people feel safe. But at the same time, if you're going to come down to one of the 200 bars or restaurants, our local businesses in downtown Phoenix that we have now, it's the parking issue is one of the biggest issues. How do you park in downtown Phoenix without paying $40 to $50 to come down to an event or so? So we really need to figure out how to help out those local businesses in downtown Phoenix, how to help them survive, and at the same time, how can we attract people to downtown but not bankrupt them when it comes to parking? Right? The other thing is Maryville. Maryville is hungry and needing more programs for youth, keeping our kids active during the summertime, during after school hours. We need to create more soccer fields, football fields, activities for our young people. You know, there's a privately owned west complex that's right there on 99th and McDowell that's being sold now. We have apartments being built right there. So there's about 18 soccer fields that are going to disappear. So where are all those individuals that use that west complex that's privately owned going to play soccer now? Right now, it's a nightmare just trying to figure out how to schedule all those different soccer teams. I just looked at council member Betty. She's nodding her head like she understands what those nightmares are. People are calling, wanting to know, how can they get a soccer field, how can they get more activities, how can they get baseball fields, softball fields out there and public safety? People want to live in their neighborhoods and feel safe. We need more police officers. And how do we do that? We need to figure that out. We need to figure out how to recruit more officers and making sure that those officers come from those neighborhoods that are in the most need. And I think little by little, we'll figure it out, but we need to figure that out. That's one of the biggest issues out there.

We need to figure out how to recruit more officers and making sure that those officers come from those neighborhoods that are in the most need. And I think little by little, we'll figure it out, but we need to figure that out. That's one of the biggest issues out there. It's not in the district anymore, but it used to be Desert sky mall that was going to close. And we've basically figured out bringing a developer, an individual that created a mall in Los Angeles and converted into a hispanic mercado atmosphere. And that's exactly what they did at Mercado de los Cielos. And so you need to think outside the box. Let's go to other cities, other states, and steal their great ideas and bring them here to Phoenix to make sure that the metro centers of the world, I still call it Chris town malls of the world and the desert skies don't close. Right. And the other thing is we got Estrella. Estrella is out there, and we have all kinds of opportunities. We talked about creating the, when we advocated for the 202 freeway, the ed pastor freeway. Basically, we sat down with the community, all the stakeholders, and they said, well, what we need to do is create quality jobs out here. And one of those things was creating a corridor for tech, a tech corridor where we can bring high paying jobs to district seven along the freeway, that people can have access, they can come and live and play and be there. And that's one of the things that when I turn on the tv and I hear that Queen Creek or surprise or Avondale just got a tech company and they just basically, I feel like they stole it from us. And we should have that right there in the Estrella mountain, that freeway corridor that we have out there. When you talk about Levine, oh, my God, people are talking about that hospital that we need. We already have a hospital zoned for it. And with a helicopter pad and all that, I think we're going for a second one. We can zone all the properties that we want and still stuff, but we need to go and find those hospitals that want to be in Levine. A full blown hospital. When I was on the council, we had two companies that wanted to open up their hospitals there, and they were fighting over and negotiating. I'm not sure what happened with that negotiation. I was termed out, and I was out of that negotiation aspect of it. We need a Costco. I mean, we lost to Costco. Levine going all the way to surprise, and they said that we were going to be next. And Buckeye already got one. So we need a Costco out there. You know, another thing is a place for families to sit down and eat. We need more restaurants. We got enough fast food restaurants. We need a sit down restaurant where families can go after a graduation, after a birthday, have their birthday parties there and enjoy each other. When you talk about South Phoenix, we need an overhaul in south Phoenix. When we talk about the light rail, I mentioned my son Michael, racing. Damn, I'm graduating from ASU. And they started. I started ASU, and they torn up Central Avenue, and it's still that way. Why? And we need to answer those questions. Why? About three months ago, I got a call from a western warehouse, local business, right on Central Avenue, St. Michael. I called district seven. They transferred me over to light rail. Then they transferred me over to the contractor, then they transferred me back to the city. And I've been going around and around in circles. So can you help me? I go, yeah, absolutely. So what I did is I called Marcus and I said, marcus, we're having this problem. Is there any way you could just sit down and talk to that person? Goes, absolutely, Michael. And two days later, Marcus and Debbie Lopez went out there and basically had a conversation with this individual, and they fixed it just like that. They basically had a. They tore up his parking lot and just basically left a four inch hole in the middle of his parking lot where people can actually fall into or their cars can actually get stuck in that trench that they had right there. They cut off the power of his lights in his parking lot. And he said, michael, those are my security lights. And I've been calling and calling and calling because I need those lights on so nobody will break in and steal my boots and my clothing and then barricades along the street so that my sign already got torn up. I just bought that sign seven months ago and a truck hit it because there was no barricade to warn it that there's a sign right there. So basically, when you have communication with individuals, we have staff members and that shout out to Debbie Lopez and Marcus for really doing their job. And once they're asked to do their job, our staff's out there. So. Representative Washington, I mean, I can go on and on and on, but those are some of the big issues that are in our community right now. Just public safety is another one that we need to make sure when you pick up that phone and call 911 that police officers are there to protect and to serve our community. And if a loved one is having a heart attack or that's ill, that the paramedics and the fire department there within minutes. Right. So. And regarding the homeless shelter, I believe, and once again, I told our staff and I told our consul, and you weren't a part of it when. When I was on the consul, that we were going to get sued.

And regarding the homeless shelter, I believe, and once again, I told our staff and I told our consul, and you weren't a part of it when. When I was on the consul, that we were going to get sued. We were going to get sued with what's going on in Cass and that we need to do something about it. And I basically fought that we cut it down to what we promised the community was 300 bids and all the services surrounding around Cas. And basically that didn't happen. On the contrary, they wanted to increase it to 1000 bids, a thousand more bids than the 800 that they had. So what I'm afraid is going to happen, because I signed that petition about 35, 34 years ago to allow cast to happen there. But the petition that I signed said that basically there was going to be 300 beds surrounded with services and that would be the max. They passed that 300 beds way long ago. So I believe that's going to happen. The same thing on the Van Buren site. The other thing is we as a city need to do better. We need to do better in communication. We can't just go in there and tell the community this is what's going to happen. No, we need to help out our homeless community. And this site has been suggested. What do you all feel? Or what do you all think? But no, what we've done is we gone in there and we said this is what we're going to do. And we had a community meeting not to get input, but to tell them what's going to happen. And then it's not even going through the planning and zoning where people can actually go and protest or say their opinion. That has to be more transparent and more open to the process. And that's wrong. That's very wrong. And you as individuals that are sitting on the council right now should not let that happen. You should have it go through the right procedure, which is the village, which is the planning and zoning. And back to you as the council member. And it's going, instead of going to a committee, individuals that we all don't have say so are you all to make that decision. Thank you, mayor, members of the council. Councilwoman Hodge, Washington. I'm going to start with the navigation center. I live down in the area by where it's at. I am, as an early supporter of it, I was not happy the way that it came out. But for those that know zoning, it's an a one property that only needed a use permit and did not have to go through the regular process for planning and zoning to get the permit to do this. I do believe they should have gone out earlier, but I think the city did a good job of trying to have. They had two community meetings. They met individually with individuals that were upset about it. They also went to organizations that requested meetings to discuss it in full. I did send a letter of support to the board of adjustment to approve it because I think the process of what the city is doing is trying to locate homeless facilities around the city is something that we need to do. Everybody's going to say, not in my backyard. Nobody wants to have it. But I also add that I'm on the fallow elementary school board. So the people that were testifying about the school that's right there, I'm a board member for that school. We take safety and security of our children as the utmost importance for that. So I know why they're talking about they fear for their children not being safe in school. I took a little offense to that, but I understand it. They're a parent, I'm a parent, and it is, but it is our number one priority to make sure that all of our children go to school. But talking to our police officers, our local police officers, they need this tool in their tool belt to help them. There's no beds available for them to take people. And our housing population, our homeless population in the fur western region is now growing. We didn't have it even a couple years ago, but it's there and it's growing. And I do believe that this is something we need in our community, and I hope we'll put in other communities as far as problems that we have in the district. I mean, I can go on and on and on, but most immediate in the west side. We need more infrastructure. I mean, these are kind of bigger things. We need infrastructure. We need more transportation options. Our bus lines stop. They don't go, they don't connect from road to road, which is problematic for people to get from to and fro. And we don't have amenities. We don't have very many sit down restaurants. We have no medical out there. We have one urgent care on 99th Avenue and Laura Buckeye roads. We have no other medical facilities. And the Levine area? Levine area in the southern area, they need more retail to catch up with all the multifamily that's been entitled down there. Levine love them to death. They'll be very vocal about what they need down there and what they want down there. And I love it, but that is something that is true. And in both Estrella and the levine areas, we also have issues with county because we both have a lot of county land that surrounds our areas and is different. We have the river that runs through it, and people use the dry riverbeds to shoot, to have parties to do all kinds of stuff down there. And that is very problematic. And again, we have that issue.

So that is problematic. And I would hope the communication between the city and county can get a little bit better on some of those issues in the downtown area. Right now, you're struggling. Well, not even struggling. The amount of growth in the downtown area is just phenomenal. Even I come downtown and right now I think one of the issues they have is the cleanup for the construction for light rail is a big deal. And also trying to mold how many more residents are living downtown versus those that weren't. Just, as Michael just said, so many more people are living downtown. And so having that urban feel and opportunities for the people that live down there and balancing it with the growth that's happening. Bigger picture. Can, will we get light rail down I ten? I think that'll help the Maryvale area and our area and then sr 30 coming through. If proposition 479 passes, I will literally be able to save that freeway from my bedroom because it'll be right below where I live. But it's a major piece of infrastructure, just like what the loop 202 is. I don't see it necessarily as a problem, although it's going to be a very big undertaking that we'll have to deal with in district seven. Thank you. Thank you so much. This one. My question is. Thank you so much. Any additional question, Councilwoman O'Brien? Thank you, mayor. I'm not sure the order, but I have three questions surrounding public safety, so maybe if they can take them all at one time. Okay. And I think this time we just did alphabetical, so it would be reverse alphabetical, so. And again, would welcome if people just want to stay close to the microphone until we're done with questions. So when I was elected to office, there were some concerns around public safety, and certainly our police department did not necessarily feel supported by the city council. Additionally, we are struggling to hire officers. We are in a situation where our firefighters are concerned about response times, as are we, and we're doing everything we can to provide them with the resources that they need. I'm curious what your stance is on public safety. My stance is I support them 100%. I know that a couple years ago, there were people like, we don't want cops in our neighborhood. We don't want to see police officers. My community wants to see police officers, and we're friends with them. I talk to my CIO's all the time. I run a block watch in my area, and we have the privilege of getting a new fire department in our area, which I want to throw that in there really quickly, but I'm 100% supportive of our officers. I got the privilege of going to a Taser training. Taser training, and I'm going to go do a police experience this weekend with the city of Phoenix Police Department. So for me, 100%, no doubt, I supportive of our police officers and our firefighters. Thank you. Do you believe that our current city leadership is capable of reforming our police department without a consent decree and DOJ monitor? Yes. And I know that that's a really tricky subject for some people, but I don't think the consent decree, I'll just say that is the way to go. And I've seen other cities and what they've gone through and how many years it's taken them to get from under the dissent decree, and I'm not going to pretend to say that I know everything about it, but it does not seem, and I would hope that the city does not go in that direction. Would you. Would you sign an agreement in principle without reading the full DOJ findings report, which would commit the city to negotiate in good faith towards a consent decree? I know this has come up, too. It's hard to sign something in good faith when you haven't read all the documents. And I know that we're going back and forth with DOJ about getting the documents for everybody to read. I don't know why they wouldn't just do that. It seems a little weird to me. Again, I don't know all the basics. I only just know what I've read and what I've been told, and I don't know if I could do it in good faith just on something that I have no idea what the report's going to say. Thank you, council member, 100%. Back in 2007, I actually ran in by enforcing the law, and people are saying, are you crazy? In Maryville and South Phoenix? Well, I knocked on every single door at least once, and people were saying, we want more police officers. We want our neighborhoods to be safe. We want our kids to be able to go to the park and play at nighttime. So I became the chair of public safety, and one of the biggest concerns I had was when I was there, we had so many police officers and firefighters that passed away. We have these beautiful services and memorials and all that, but it's too late. So what I created was the star Spangled on Banner celebration.

It seems a little weird to me. Again, I don't know all the basics. I only just know what I've read and what I've been told, and I don't know if I could do it in good faith just on something that I have no idea what the report's going to say. Thank you, council member, 100%. Back in 2007, I actually ran in by enforcing the law, and people are saying, are you crazy? In Maryville and South Phoenix? Well, I knocked on every single door at least once, and people were saying, we want more police officers. We want our neighborhoods to be safe. We want our kids to be able to go to the park and play at nighttime. So I became the chair of public safety, and one of the biggest concerns I had was when I was there, we had so many police officers and firefighters that passed away. We have these beautiful services and memorials and all that, but it's too late. So what I created was the star Spangled on Banner celebration. Basically was honoring all the fallen police officers and firefighters. And right here on Washington, we would have a banner, it would be a red banner for firefighters with the picture of the firefighter that basically passed away the year that he passed away and the. The year of his service. Right. And then basically, we would do it in blue for the police officers. And then we had an educational component that was along with it that if you had an iPad or smartphone that basically can go in there on this special app for teachers and bring your class and go through a field trip, and you can find out more about that firefighter or police officer. And you find out that they weren't just firefighters or police officers. They were basically coaches for their baseball teams, you know, little leagues and ministers and helping out the youth and all that. So we got to learn a little bit more of who that individual was. And then we would end it with a big celebration and the Memorial Day celebration with fireworks. And then we had young people that would write messages on these little boats, and then they would light them up, and they would go on the lake out there at Cesar Chavez. And then we had fireworks with, we would recite the names of each fallen police officer and firefighter. So, absolutely, we need to support. We need to make sure that they know that their love, that they're wanted and that they're respected. And I think that's one of the reasons that we created that. The other thing that isn't that I created that doesn't exist anymore is a crime summit. We created a crime summit for all the block watch individuals. At that time. It was district eight and district seven. And then we had all the priests and commanders out there and we had the police chief. And basically it was a day out at the police training complex that they can actually have an hour with their commander of their precinct and learn about the services that each precinct offers to the community. There's a lot of people that don't understand that. It's not just a precinct. You can use it for meetings. There's services, there's resources that a lot of people don't know about. So it was a time for individuals that wanted to meet their commanders and the community action officers that they can have that dialogue for an hour. And then afterwards, the mayor, myself, and the police chief would have a question and answer with any individuals that were there at that crime summit. And then they had a chance to go through the training just like any police officer would have through the complex. And then the Chris and then the next question, which is, do you believe our current city leadership is capable of reforming our PD without a consent to korean DOJ monitor? No, absolutely. I believe they do. They can. And would you say sign an agreement in principle without reading the full DOJ findings report? No, I would not sign it at all. And I would, I would actually talk to our past sheriff, Paul Pinson, and asked him what was his experience and what are his thoughts. And I think we all know what his thoughts are. We heard it very clear on the media and what he thinks about the county and how they are going through and how it's a waste of money. Right. Thank you, Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you for your three questions. I may need a refresher on some of the questions. The first one is, yes, I support and respect our public safety departments, both the police department and the fire department. The work that they do is incredibly difficult, and we are not there for every incident that happens. But we need to be supportive of our police department. And I have had the chance to work specifically with the bias squad unit in terms of hate crimes and incidents. When I work for a national anti hate organization and I saw the care that they took with victims, I saw the care that they took to ensure the institutions that might be targeted were informed and were protected. So I know the value that our police officers bring to the community. And it's not just the ones that are patrolling, it's the ones that are investigating. It's the ones who are out there protecting and serving our citizens. The second question. Second question is, do you believe our current city leadership is capable of reforming RPD without a consent decree and DOJ monitor? Yes, I do. Because every system, every large operation, there is always a time to improve, and there's always a process that should be in place to reform. So, yes, and I think it's important that we do it carefully, thoughtfully. But yes, to your answer with regard to the consent decree, no, I would not signed, sign unseen. So, yes, I am a major supporter of public safety. The reason is my dad was one of Arizona's first emts at 16 years old, 20 year volunteer firefighter for the city of Phoenix. He was there when all they had were jackets and helmets and the little rubber boots, and we saw, and he saw that evolution. And so it's really ingrained in me from that perspective.

He was there when all they had were jackets and helmets and the little rubber boots, and we saw, and he saw that evolution. And so it's really ingrained in me from that perspective. I also, you know, we're, as we know, the community action officers, they keep getting moved around because, because of budget constraints and things like that. So I'd be really interested in seeing how we can get community action officers back, more involved, and I've heard from them personally that they would like to be more involved. As far as the second question, I don't know if I have all the information. The information I do have was what was provided at the community meetings, the roadshow, as the media called it, and the media kind of bashed the city's roadshow. I don't know why I attended. I thought it was good. I thought great information was given. I thought our city leadership gave some good plans as to how we can reform. My biggest concern was this idea that, oh, well, if it worked in St. Louis and Baltimore, then it's going to work for the city of Phoenix. I'm not really a big fan of the copy and paste type of policy, so that's what I got from those community meetings. So because of that, I wouldn't necessarily sign. You know, I would sign an agreement saying, I think we can handle it ourselves based on the information that I have currently. Okay, thank you. Appreciate that. Thank you, councilwoman. Any additional questions? Councilman waring? Well, actually, can I ask a question to staff? Yes. Okay. Thank you. So this would be for attorney Julie Cree. I think it was only this morning, or maybe last night that I heard there might be concerns about the eligibility of former councilman Nowakowski because he had served three full terms. This was news to me. So I'm just curious, is he eligible? And if not, why not? Because he's out of office now. He served the three terms. My understanding was if you serve two full terms as mayor, then you can't come back as mayor sometime down the road. But I don't remember that was the case for council people. And in recent memory, both Sal Decio and Thelda Williams both served more than three terms in their lifetime. Now, they hadn't served three full terms before they came back, and Sal was actually appointed for his second term. So secondly, there were concerns about someone who did not apply. They were out in the news media about their eligibility because they've been a state legislator. So I just, going forward, as long as this is going to be the process, if nothing else, I hope before this comes up again that we have some consistency about who is eligible for these appointments. So mayor, members of council. Councilman Waring. So we did have a question come up about the consecutive terms, and our city charter is silent as to essentially a break between. I'm sorry, between those consecutive terms of office. So I basically let everyone know that that could be an issue because our charter is silent as to that issue. So. Mayor Julie so we could potentially get sued. And if. And what happens then, an injunction. District seven would go out. Representative try to figure out what we might expect. I don't think anybody wants to do something that is illegal or appoint somebody who's ineligible, but we obviously, first, appoint exception, not lawyers. But second, it's not really our job to sort that out. So, like, what would a judge do if it's just signed? So mayor and counsel, there's a possibility of a challenge? Like I said, there's a possibility. There's an open legal question, and it could just be an action to see if that person is eligible to keep the office, which is called a quo warranto action. I think in the past, mayor and Julia asked for guidance from the attorney general or some such. Maybe it's not practical here today right now, but I would just suggest going forward, we get some guidance because we have quite a few of these appointments. I ran against somebody who was appointed for my seat. Sal was appointed, Greg Stanton was appointed, Tom Simplot beat somebody who was appointed, and Betty beat somebody who was appointed. Can't even count how many that is. But that's like seven or something, I think just in the last maybe 20 years. So, so it comes up pretty regularly. We just might be prepared, given the quality of life at the legislature, they might want to come over to the friendly confines of the city someday down the road, we might want to, particularly on days like today, they're probably like, why the hell did I ever want to be a state legislator? So what was I thinking? Poor judgment working for you. So, having been when I can make those kind of jokes, but I just, like, I can make jokes about Illinois being from, but I think it would behoove us just to get some kind of clarity on both of those issues. I don't know how we do that, but I think we've done it in advance in the past, so there's that. I also wish we had a process where people, as far as I know, the only person who could appear live in district seven. I'm not asking for your address. Mayor would be the mayor. Otherwise.

I have a perfect plan, but I think anything better than, oh, we might appoint people who are ineligible. Got to be a better way. So thank you, mayor. I appreciate it. It sounds like there is no clear answer. Thank you. I'll turn to Vice mayor Stark for a motion. Thank you, mayor. I would like to nominate Carlos Galino. Alvaro. Thank you. No motion. No second is required. Roll call. Guardado. Yes. Hodge. Washington. Yes. O'Brien. Mayor, may I explain my vote? Please do. Thank you. I will be voting yes today for Carlos, and I will be doing so because he will run for the special election, but has committed to not running for the full four year term. And so with that, I vote yes. Pastor? Yes. Robinson. Yes. Mayor, may I explain my vote also? Please do. Thank you. For pretty much the same reasons that Councilwoman O'Brien stated, I will be voting for Mister Galindo. Elvira also. But all candidates really showed a great deal of stick to itiveness, grit, and everything that it takes to be in the office. But I like the fact that he has stated that he is not interested in running for the position permanently. And I think that is a question to be decided by the residents in district seven. So my vote is yes. Thank you, Waring. Mayor, I'd like to explain my vote. Please do. So. I think Kevin said, maybe fly in the ointment or something earlier. So first I'm going to vote no. But we had talked, Carlos, and I think you understand my position. So I think you understand, hopefully very clearly, because I was very pleased with your presentation when you appeared before Deb Stark and I, a few years ago about the ethics commission, and then I think a subsequent iteration of that same process. I was very impressed with your resume. I think you'll make an excellent member. I have no doubt. I think that about all the members I served with, Michael Nowakowski, he was a great colleague. I enjoyed him very much. You know, Lisa, I used to see in the hall and so forth, so I think you all would have done a fine job. I do have concerns about this process. I won't belabor it. But I've just thought that we should have people who are independent, who are not going to run, and I do appreciate that you check one of those boxes. I just think, in fairness to the voters who are not going to get to participate, that that should be something we should try to do, get somebody who's a little more neutral. I appreciate your resume. I wish you all the best of luck serving with you and appreciate you understanding my position. I vote no. Stark and, mayor, if I can explain my vote. First off, I want to say thank you for all the speakers today and the people who wanted to serve district seven. I'm impressed by Carlos dedication to the district. I know he's lived in it for 20 years, but I'm very impressed that you're willing to donate your money to nonprofits, your salaries. So that really speaks highly of your dedication to the residents of District Seven. Thank you, mayor. Thank you, Carlos. We have worked together for 15 years, whether it be you helping set up leadership programs for the latino and african american community, your fight against hate, or your work building coalitions, because district seven and eight are quite close in many areas, you and I have actually been quite close neighbors for and seen each other often at particularly shopping opportunities. And it's good to be able to vote in your favor. I think you will be a great interim council member. I vote yes. Passes seven one. Thank you.

The school is named after Mary McLeod Bethune, one of the most important black educators, civil and women's rights leader and government official of the 20th century, with a role as an advocate for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, giving African Americans an advocate in government. Phoenix elementary School District one proudly named the school in her honor in 1945.

Volunteer to test out features on our new site. Details are in this post. Hello, I'm Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. What if I told you that the cure for cancer will come through Phoenix, Arizona? I believe that it will. Nearly 20 years ago, the city of Phoenix partnered with business, education, science and medical visionaries to make a substantial investment in the medical and biosciences. Today, our life science leaders are driving translational discovery, which is also driving our tremendous growth. There are many reasons Phoenix is the fastest growing city in the United States, our commitment to growing a strong, diverse economy, our support of entrepreneurial ecosystems and our unparalleled quality of life. But as you're about to see, it's also an investment we made 20 years ago that is paying off handsomely. Today, we believe Phoenix is the new land of opportunity. We invite you to join us. There's something happening in Phoenix. It's groundbreaking, it's life changing, and it's driving tremendous growth. Many factors have helped elevate Phoenix to the fifth largest city in the nation, but none has had greater impact than a field that has led to transformative thinking and genomics, precision medicine, molecular medicine, cancer and rare disease research. Bioscience. It's driving translational discovery and Phoenix's rapid ascension from a canal system that brought life to this valley 2000 years ago to tGen, which helped unravel the mysteries of life. Innovation and collaboration have always driven our rise. Since 2019, our growth in the biosciences and healthcare has been unrivaled. In that time, we've added millions of square feet of biomedical space, billions in capital investments in primary facilities, creating thousands of new jobs. That places Phoenix in the nation's top five for emerging life science clusters. The home of Phoenix's translational discovery is the Phoenix biomedical campus, or as we like to call it, the PBC, a thriving 30 acre center of bioscience, research, education and urban life in the heart of a bustling downtown. Our welcoming culture of bold thinking and inspiring teamwork was born in 2002 with the International Genomics Consortium IGC and the Translational Genomics Research Institute TGen, an affiliate of the City of Hope, a partnership that has spawned more than 25 companies and thousands of medical breakthroughs, including Ashy in analytics, paradigm diagnostics and viomics, which are now a part of exact sciences. Along with Charis, life sciences and video animal health all play critical roles in precision medicine. Exac Sciences has a growing presence on campus.

Our welcoming culture of bold thinking and inspiring teamwork was born in 2002 with the International Genomics Consortium IGC and the Translational Genomics Research Institute TGen, an affiliate of the City of Hope, a partnership that has spawned more than 25 companies and thousands of medical breakthroughs, including Ashy in analytics, paradigm diagnostics and viomics, which are now a part of exact sciences. Along with Charis, life sciences and video animal health all play critical roles in precision medicine. Exac Sciences has a growing presence on campus. So does NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases main research facility. The newest addition to the campus is 850 PBC, a 227,000 square foot, fully lab enabled building designed for bioinnovation and collaboration. It's home to Arizona State University's translational science, their entrepreneurship and innovation team for biosciences, including their health entrepreneurship accelerator, lab Heal label. And while the facility is humming with research and discovery, more innovators are always welcome. The center for Entrepreneurial Innovation, CEI, plays a pivotal role on campus by supporting entrepreneurs with their market validation lab program, as well as growing companies with lab Force, a program for training lab technicians. Education is a critical pillar of the PBC. All three of Arizona's public universities have schools on campus for medical education, research and collaboration. Nowhere else in Arizona will you find three state universities in one place that's more than 15,000 students working together on or close to the Phoenix biomedical campus. Looking for collaborators for your research? The universities and innovators on the PBC have close access to critical core services and clinical trials to deliver the latest innovations. For example, the Phoenix Veterans Administration's million Vets program partnered with the University of Arizona College of Medicine, Phoenix. This concentration of universities creates a pipeline for talent and access to innovative entrepreneurs through universities and spinouts of existing campus tenants. You also have access to researchers and physician scientists at the surrounding health systems and institutes of research excellence. To inspire the spirit of collaboration, innovators have direct access to on site programs designed to encourage working together both on campus and throughout the community. And innovators there's still room to grow 1.7 million sqft has been built 6 million build out how is this drive for innovation and collaboration working out for us? From 2007 to 2019, the fee the Phoenix Bioscience Healthcare workforce expanded significantly, lifting all sectors of our economy, placing Phoenix among the top cities in the nation for startups and business creation. The PBC isn't the only reason Phoenix is attracting so much talent. Our quality of life is like no other. Did you know Phoenix is home to three of the five largest city parks in the country? South Mountain Preserve, the second largest city park in the us, offers more than 16,000 acres for hiking, biking and horseback riding. Within our city limits, there are more than 250 miles of trails. We also have nearly 1000 miles of bike paths and bike lanes. Worried about traffic? Don't be. 90% of those living in Phoenix have less than a 30 minutes commute, shortest of any of the top 15 cities in the nation. And Phoenix Sky harbor, one of the nation's busiest and friendliest airports, is also one of the most convenient, only a ten minute drive from the PBC. There are so many ways to escape the award winning dining, our coffee shops and breweries, our music and festival scene, including first Fridays, the largest monthly art festival in the country. Like sports, there's plenty to root for new arrivals. Also like our low pressure attitude and how easy it is to fit in. We like to say, no one's a stranger here, and new explorers are always welcome. There's something happening in Phoenix. It's driving life changing discoveries, industry shaping innovations. And with so much room to grow limitless opportunities, the future is Phoenix bioscience. Join us. The man who built this house in 1911 has a major street in the Phoenix area named after him, a high school named after him, and a building at Arizona State University named after him. James H. McClintock was co founder of the Arizona Republic newspaper. He was an early postmaster in Phoenix. He was part of the team that identified the site for the Roosevelt Dam. He was wounded in the Spanish American War and he was also one of the early broadcasters for KTAR radio. In addition, James McClintock wrote two of the most credible books about Arizona history. We're very lucky that we still have the building that he lived in and raised his family in for many years. Thanks to Mayor Gallego and our historic preservation office, we can all enjoy this building and honor one of the most accomplished citizens in the history of Phoenix.

The building you see to my right is fast approaching its 100th birthday. Up until 1923, the city of Phoenix had no repository for Phoenix specific artifacts. In 1923, Elizabeth Oldacre and the Daughters of the American Revolution created the Arizona Museum Society with the sole purpose of constructing a building that was going to be dedicated to Phoenix specific artifacts. And that's this building. It was called the Arizona Museum. This building was in operation until 1996 when all the artifacts were moved to the Phoenix Museum of History at Heritage Square. This building, even though it's no longer in use as a museum, is on the Phoenix Historic Register and has been since 1989. It's a very good example of a building that was used specifically to house Phoenix history. Good afternoon. I will call to order the policy session for Tuesday, May 21, 2024.

I also joined our partner, St. Vincent DePaul for a ribbon cutting ceremony to mark the new dePaul manor, which will add 100 new transitional housing beds for unhoused seniors, veterans and adults living with disability.

Thai chili to go offers fresh and affordable dine in options with its unique brand of authentic food to Levine, and it held its official ribbon cutting grant opening in my district. Also, the streets department hosted a ceremonial street name unveiling to recognize boxing legend Michael Carbajal. It was most likely one of the department's most well attended on Valens and it was great to see the pride and love the community has for their own in the heart of my district. Next slide the streets department hosted a well attended community meeting for the McDowell Road Revitalization project. I look forward to seeing the results of the community's input on that.

Thank you, mayor. I just want to say happy birthday to my favorite marathon man, Zach Wallace. Happy birthday. Thank you. Happy birthday. Any additional updates or it's hard to beat that one. All right. With that then, we will go to our agendized item and I'll turn to our city manager to introduce the budget. Thank you, mayor. Members of the council, good afternoon and it is a pleasure to be here again today. Amber Williamson, budget and research director, and I have a very brief presentation for you concerning the 24 25 operating budget. Today's vote is really what allows us to start the procedural legal adoption process. But I think more importantly, what today demonstrates is your commitment to strong fiscal, strong, strong and responsible fiscal stewardship. And that fiscal stewardship will be on full display as we move forward in the next couple of years. Following this, as we've talked about at great length, we are aspiring to preserve the continuity of vital city services in the face of adverse action by the state of Arizona who are taking away from us roughly 100 plus million dollars on an ongoing basis annually. And this budget that you've put forward today gives us a fighting chance at being able to withstand the loss of that revenue and to ensure that these vital services that our residents have come to depend on will be there in their hour of need. And so with that, I'd like to turn it over to Amber Williamson for the full presentation. All right, thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, Mayor, members of the council and Phoenix residents pleased to be here to present and ask for action today to adopt the 24 25 city manager's budget going over our general fund budget. As you know, we do have a projected one time surplus for next fiscal year of $80 million. However, because of the state's actions to make ongoing revenue cuts through Senate bills 1131 that eliminates residential rental sales tax, effective January of 25, and Senate Bill 1828 that reduced the individual income tax rate to the current flat tax, resulting in millions of dollars of ongoing revenue reductions. We do have baseline general fund budget deficits projected in fiscal 26 of 92 million and again in fiscal 27 of 31 million. And because we are required to adopt a balanced budget every year, our city manager is proposing to set aside that $80,000,000.01 time surplus and not spend it. We want to make sure we preserve the services phoenix residents have come to rely on every day. We also want it to be in the fund balance as budget research constructs the fiscal 25 26 budget. We also know we are going to have ongoing operating costs from the voter approved general obligation bond program. We did forecast those costs, multi year forecast I presented to you on February 27, but we want to make sure resources are available as we go forward. Residents can also see more information about our bond program at Phoenix dot Gov bond. We did ask residents to comment on the budget. We did that through eleven budget hearings held April 2 through the 16th. We also had residents comment directly to budget and research and use the fundamental Phoenix tool we heard support for programs and services. However, we know that residents that did participate in the budget engagement process, they want more services, not less. In total, we received 371 comments from 173 residents. Also, all input is included on our website at Phoenix dot Gov budget, including hearings of the budget, hearings that we or videos of the budget hearings hearings we held, as well as all voicemails and written comments that we received. Included in the proposed budget are 30 critical positions that are needed for both the general fund and non general fund. We do not need additional funding for these positions. Resources have already been identified in department existing budgets. These are for primarily converting temporary positions to ongoing for departments and functions, including communications, neighborhood services, council finance, public works, police and planning and development. So next steps after today, we'll come back to the council for our legally required budget adoption. Steps. May 29 will be tentative budget adoption, June 12 will be final budget adoption and then July 1 property tax levy adoption. That does conclude the presentation in council. We are asking for action to approve the city manager's proposed 24 25 budget. Wonderful. Thank you, vice mayor, do we have a motion? Yes, thank you. I move that we approve the fiscal year 2024 to 25 city manager budget second, we have a motion and a second. Do we have any questions? All right, then we will go to public comment. We will start with virtual comment with Teresa Hill, followed by Evelyn Castillo. Thank you, mayor and council. I've never been involved in the city budget before and I'm glad my heart for the homeless has, especially for the seniors it got me involved, and I've learned a lot, and I thank you for that opportunity.

And we've invested in the homeless, but there are still thousands in needs. A good investment for the city of Phoenix is helping prevent from being homeless, to be proactive and prevent the homeless from being evicted. And I ask for more counsel and legal aid to help these people stay in their homes or in a safe place, especially the seniors. It is expected to surge in their needs. So I thank you for your time in helping the homeless. And I give a special thanks out there for our police and our firefighters. They risk themselves for us. I pray for protection over them, for all they do. Thank you. Thank you. Evelyn will be next, followed by Joanne Branch. Evelyn, I can hear you. Okay, there you are. Evelyn, the floor is yours. Okay. Why don't we go to Joann Branch? Can you hear me? Yes. Now we can. I'm so sorry. I was. There's a few members who are joining online who are having trouble jumping onto the webex, so I've just been helping them join. There's a total of, like, ten other members who are joining virtually who couldn't make it in person, unfortunately. So I just really wanted to recognize them as well. I'm not sure if they'll be able to join and share their stories, but just wanted to put that out there, but yeah. My name is Evelyn Castillo. I am the field organizer for take back our homes campaign. I'm actually here today to share one of our members story. Her name is Drina Gordon. She is 52, residing in Phoenix. She's actually unable to work due to disability that she's been going through for the past four years. In 2020, she actually, through the pandemic, faced an eviction. Her and her husband and her entire family got sick with COVID and were unable to work, therefore unable to make rent. And so she was unaware of any legal assistance available to her. And she is still currently struggling with housing. And so she is wanting to show up today to state that she supports the Take Back our Homes campaign and advocating for more funding for right to council program. And that's why we're here today. And so with my community pleading for allocating funds for legal representation to help slow down eviction cases is what she wanted to state today. So I just wanted to also make that clear that there's a few more of us that are still trying to log on to share our stories. But thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Joanne is next, followed by Cindy. Hi. Hello. My name is Joanne Branch and I'm here in regards to take back our home homes. I was illegally evicted due to my abuser lying that I was involved in a criminal in a crime. I told them it's not true. They told me they needed proof. Unfortunately, the truth came after the eviction. I had to go to criminal court first, where all charges were dismissed because it was based on lies. Then the property wanted to move me back in after the fact, and that took months. So it left me homeless for a while. While homeless, I realized I just needed someone to represent me so that the truth can be told in the eviction court. I was so upset because I was not able to talk to the judge, which made me feel sad. I had no right. And so I'm here. And we demand funding for a right to counsel program so that our voices can be heard in eviction court. Thank you. Cindy is next, followed by Gloria. All right, Gloria is next, followed by Bronnie. No. Okay, no audio. Bronnie is next, followed by Nancy. Same thing. Okay, we'll go then to Guadalupe, followed by Ben in person. Would you have Nancy? All right, we'll go. Nancy. Oh, shit. Oh, wait, I'm. Oh, damn it. Won't I? Okay, Nancy, we can, we heard, we heard you. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. The floor is yours, please. Oh, thank you. Hi, thank you for your patience. My name is Nancy Palmer. Thank goodness for the Take back our homes campaign. If it weren't for them helping me get right to counsel through community legal services, we would have been evicted in March with $10,000 in fines for paying our rent on time because we didn't sign what was a bogus lease. The Rights and Responsibilities act, responsibility, all on the tenants, responsibilities on landlords and homeowners is zero. Okay? They get to kick us out whenever we want, however they want. We need right to counsel. Because of Brett Rasner from community legal services, we were able to just get a notice to vacate, still stay in the home for 45 days, only have to pay $4,900 in fines and whatnot. And now we're living in a hotel hoping that another apartment complex will accept our application after my son just gave him $300. So we need right to council now to stop these housing investors from keeping people priced out of their homes. Thank you very much. Have a wonderful day. Thank you. We'll go Guadalupe Anaya, aki, and then Ben Loughlin, Persona. Hola, buenas tardes. Hello. Good afternoon. My name is Guadalupe Anaya.

We also want for you to provide or finance a permanent program for services, legal services for people who are going through eviction, including people for people who have a legal status problem. And we don't want the $27 million to go to the police because they are not our safety. Gracias. That's the reason why we're here. Thank you. Ben is next, followed by Andrea Luna Cervantes. Hi, my name is Ben Loughlin. I'm a resident of district seven. I'm here today to speak in opposition to the proposed budget, specifically the proposed 27 million increase in general funds to the police department. Throughout the past several years, we've talked to y'all repeatedly about how budgets are a reflection of values, despite what city leadership says publicly, budget documents tell us what y'all are really about. And once again, these values documents paint a really heartbreaking picture for the future of working class and poor Phoenix residents, particularly unsheltered folks, people of color, and immigrants without legal status. Right now, you're actively pushing unsheltered and low income residents further and further away from downtown Phoenix, while providing little to no resources to support the people you're pushing out and the neighborhoods you're pushing them into. Rather than be the courageous, innovative city you claim to be, you continue to pour billions of dollars into a strategy for public safety that relies on disappearing and displacing people you consider problems. Rather than acknowledging you're continuously creating the conditions that result in suffering, crisis and violence. You use police as a tool to hide your failures and then call it crime. Instead of 27 million from the general fund for police, we need those funds to go to resources to actually support the health, safety, and stability of Phoenix residents, you have an opportunity in this budget cycle to make that happen. If you value the lives of Phoenix residents, use those 27 million in general funds for things that will actually keep people alive. Things like water stations and heat relief centers with expanded hours in the neighborhoods you're pushing people into, specifically Maryville. And rather than continuing to patchwork together grants and ARPA leftovers, use those general funds to provide a permanent, sustainable funding source for a right to counsel program for families facing eviction. And make sure it includes people without legal status. Phoenix police have killed two people in just this month. Their names were Christopher Tavarez and Devin Montgomery. Today also marks four years since Ryan Whitaker was shot in the back by Phoenix police with his hands up in the air. If you vote to increase the police department budget today, you're doing that with their blood on your hands and the blood of the countless future others who will be killed by this department. Please don't forget that. Thank you. Andrea is next, followed by Darren hi, my name is Andrea Lunas Advantage. I'm a community organizer with the Take back our Homes campaign. I'm calling on the council to include funding for a right to counsel program for our people and our community in the 2024 2025 budget. It's amazing that funding has been located to go into housing from ARPA funding for this budget cycle. However, preventative measures needs to to be taken so people can stay in their homes. Solely investing in housing does not solve the problem. Ensuring people have an attorney at eviction court allows for a more fair and humane process for renters. When renters have a fair chance, evictions drop. I urge you to use these funds to continue to address the housing crisis, especially as the state continues to kick the can down the road. Money from the general funds need to be allocated to a right to council program. It was a top item advocated from community during budget hearings these past couple of weeks. We need to listen to what people are saying and asking in need. Investing in our community, period, is what needs to happen with this budget and it doesn't seem to exist. We need a right to council and investments in the community like water stations and heat relief. I hope everyone on this council directs this money to critical community resources. Thank you for your time. Darren is next, followed by Colton. Hi, my name is Darren Jesuk. I'm with the take back your homes committee. This is kind of ridiculous to have to beg for a place to live.

Thank you for your time. Darren is next, followed by Colton. Hi, my name is Darren Jesuk. I'm with the take back your homes committee. This is kind of ridiculous to have to beg for a place to live. You would think that it's a human right or something. Back in February, the attorney general, Chris Mays sued real page and nine residential landlords for an illegal price fixing conspiracy. I wonder how long it's been going on. And I'm quite sure it's been a very long time, and I'm sure it's going on all over the country. You all knew rent prices have been out of control. Kind of out of control. Out of control and you didn't do anything about it. You knew for even longer that landlords and their attorneys were evicting tenants left and right. What would you expect when a tenant can barely afford rent, let alone legal counsel? And you didn't do anything about it. You and others talk about homeless situations when you have created it by doing nothing. Human beings got that. Human beings are fighting for a place to live at a fair price. Until you get off your butts, it's going to be worse. And are you going to allow it to get worse when you can start doing something about it now? The B's has got to stop. Human beings are really getting fed up, especially when we have to beg for for a decent place to live for a fair price. It's way past time for you to do something about it. You are neglecting human beings and allowing them to be put out on the streets. It's affecting mental and physical health and security, and that really sucks. And that's why we really need to be a major part of this budget and permanently fund the right to counsel. It is way past time to start doing something right for a change and fight for the little guy and make law enforcement do better with less. Thank you. Colton is next, followed by Jessica Bueno, mayor and members of the council. Today I stand before you with pressing concerns for the state of West Phoenix along the Glendale Avenue corridor. We are witnessing a troubled rise in homelessness and blatant drug use on our streets, in our alleyways, and we cannot let up on our efforts in progress to continue to help our citizens and keep our neighborhoods safe. We cannot ignore the impact of rampant drug use in our neighborhoods. It affects not only those directly involved, but also poses a threat to public safety and the well being of our communities. I drive along 39th Avenue on a daily basis and notice individuals that are blatantly consuming drugs with their belongings scattered around them. In La Pradera park. In the evening, children are playing soccer at the same park with the same individuals. Continue with this conduct. This week, multiple emergency vehicles surrounded a bus stop on Glendale Avenue where a man appeared to be deceased. In addition to that, the near permanent group of transients by Circle K off of Glendale Avenue. In this I 17 are always slumped over, folded in half, high on drugs. Seeing this on a daily basis begins to take a toll. There are days when I feel that the neighborhood will never get better. I find myself saying I have no faith in my community, but I refuse to feel defeated. This is why I'm here, to speak up and represent those that have become apathetic or have simply given up. This is why I urge you to join me in advocating for additional funding for both law enforcement and homelessness resources. We must bolster our police force to effectively combat drug related crimes and provide security. Allocate resources for increased patrols, specialized units targeting drug trafficking and community outreach programs aimed at prevention and rehabilitation. Invest in comprehensive homelessness resources that offer not only temporary shelter but also long term solutions. These issues are complex, but they're not. They are not insurmountable. Let's stand together and demand the support and funding for additional police enforcement homeless solutions needed to address these critical issues. Thank you. Alma is next followed. I'm sorry, Jessica is next followed by Alma. Good afternoon council and Mayor Gallego. My name is Jessica Bueno. I live in district seven and I'm also the Green and Clean campaign specialist for Chispa, Arizona. Chispa Arizona, as you may know, is an environmental justice organization where we focus organizing in west and South Phoenix. I am here today to speak about the city's budget and also in support of the Pueblos budget as well.

Las Vegas communidades por que la ciudad un deficit de en ellos, el los proximos dos. And the city told us that there was no money available to increase the support for our communities because the city was facing a deficit. In the next two years, they reserved $180 million so that $180 million to help out the building for the following year. And that's why we're here, to request that you put and install more water fountains. There's five current ones, but we're requesting, especially in the Maryville area, and we're requesting for those services not to be shut off at five, but all the way up to 10:00 because there's people, homeless people that are living out in the streets. And so there's also the elderly that need these services as well. Las esto fresientos oluciones realistas a las crisis de salojo. The city is not providing realistic solutions for the people that are facing evictions. And what we're asking is these programs and projects so that they can be guaranteed a permanent solution and for these programs to be expanded, providing legal help que inclu llas Personas sine estatu legal, including people that don't have a legal status. Gracias. Please take these demands into consideration. Thank you. Myesha is next, followed by Kansas. Hello, my name is Miesha Fish. Pronouns she and her. I'm with the Take Back our homes campaign. I'm a woman with disabilities on a fixed income. My last experience with homelessness was due to a roommate breaking the lease and I was evicted. I received only I received an income only once a month and I was only given days to gather my things. It was day shy of my payday, so I lost everything except what I could carry. I'm not saying that legal representation would have assisted me in my situation. However, it definitely was a guarantee. It was guaranteed without shelter is not right is a necessity. Thankfully, after three and a half years wait, I was able to secure housing via voucher. I was able to attain necessary stability and continue my sobriety and give back to my community in the form of advocacy work is probably the reason I am so passionate about my advocacy work with organizations such as ACLU of Arizona and unemployed Workers United and the Take Back our Homes campaign. I have spoken in front of both Phoenix City Council and Tempe councils with regards to the source of income anti discrimination ordinance that we were able to get past last year. Thank you for giving me a home and the opportunity to build a better life. I am truly grateful and I would like to add, if I may, over the last year we lost over 600 souls in our homeless community. I unfortunately knew one of those who passed from heat exposure. His name was Roosevelt. He died in his tent in the zone. I worked on a project called we are the homelessness and unfortunately he's gone. So please, if you could. Water is a necessity as well as structure. Thank you and have a good day. Thank you. Kansas is next, followed by Guadalupe Vasquez, Praximo. Hi, my name is Kansas. I'm here opposing the budget because I support permanently funding the right to counsel program for families facing eviction. I also support putting that water station outside of the Maryvale Community center and I support expanding heat relief center hours until 10:00 p.m. the facts have shown themselves to be true in every case where a tenant had a lawyer, pretty much like, pretty much every time they were able to come to some sort of deal that extended their stay at their place of residence, whether it's even a few months, like three months, but that makes all the difference keeping them off the street because they're able to make a plan, they're able to figure out the next step instead of just being kicked out of their homes and left on the streets, abandoned. Last year, the city of Phoenix spent $1 billion on the police budget, 1000 million dollars, and I think we can spare 80 million, 27 million comparatively measly amounts of money to help prevent homelessness because, you know, nobody wants to be homeless and nobody wants to interact with it on a daily basis, you know, our emergency services don't want to be called out to the zone, you know, who knows how many times a day, honestly, and, you know, and the police don't want to be out there sweeping and harassing homeless people in the sweltering Phoenix heat. So if we can use this money to prevent homelessness, we're helping everybody. Thank you. Guadalupe Vasquez, proxima. And then blanca proxima.

I continue and I'm here continually and I keep on insisting when we have awareness, action, we can accomplish many things. Awareness so that we can know the needs that the community has. Intencion para lograr algorithm intention, so that we can accomplish something, something that would benefit our community and acting before the crisis that is being presented, not only our families, but I would imagine that also yours as well. I feel frustrated at how it is possible that in less time, the $27 million and giving it and providing it to the police department, I am not in agreement. La prevencions Pacquiaca Menos Violencia prevention starts from the very foundation we need to prevent that. Our community. We need for our community to be firm and having programs for our youth. That way there will be less violence. You know what I would do with the $27 million? I would once again help out my community so it would flourish and you would also be benefited from it. Yes. Los recomiendo alos queasin los numeros le recomiendo valencias chemical munidatiene los podemos de la grand barrier. And I'm serious about this. I would recommend that you go out and go walk around our neighborhood. You yourself, you can see the needs that exist. We can go and do a walk through in the great community that we do have, and you'll be able to see those needs and how vulnerable these communities are. Responder. And me, myself, I can take you through this walkthrough, and you will. You'll feel safe and calm walking about the community without your bodyguards nor police. You'll see that everything is safe, and the community will respond to you. We do have a crisis, and this climate change is currently here. We need to make these changes. Gracias. Thank you. Maria Gonzalez. And then Estela Varela, Proxima. Good afternoon, council. Mayor Gallego. I am here today. It's my first time. Sorry, I'm a little nervous. I just come in to tell you that I am here to support the community because of the budget that is being sent out. I also hope, as a parent, you know, you want to keep your kids safe. I have children. I have three, and I have a little one who has autism. And I also do appreciate that you guys do have resources for these certain things. But at the same time, I would like our resources to help our homelessness and community and people that are suffering out in the streets, because we do receive a lot of trust trespassing. And recently, this upcoming, the beginning of the month, I have just received only this from the police. This is not nothing to really help secure my family and my children. I have to go out of my way to be able to protect my children. Whenever somebody, excuse me, tries to trespass and is under the influence of illegal drugs and my children are outside playing, who knows what is out there, because all the time I see is people doing illegal substances right outside my home. So it is important that things are regulated within these, you know, crisis around the world and even our, you know, state. I think it's important for us as parents, you know, you want to keep a safe, secure community and healthy children to grow up and not live out in the streets as. As per se. I pretty much see that, you know, nothing is ever done. We also live in a mobile home community where we're always suffering from management constantly coming up to us, telling us that what we should do, what we should not do. But when it comes to them doing the job that we pay them for, which we almost pay $1,000 for rental, and apart from that, I pay mortgage, which is over 1500 and rental space is 1000. So can you imagine paying almost 3000 a month and being able to still support your children, your family and everything in the community is so hard for us as a family to be able to support our children. So please be aware of these facts that we can go through these tough times and hope that you guys do something about these, you know, circumstances. Thank you. Appreciate it.

Buenos tardes, consejal y al caldesta inombres. Estela Ibibone, Districto Cinco. Good afternoon, mayor and council members. My name is Estela and I live in district five. I want to talk about the budget to the city's budget, and I'm surprised by seeing that the city added $27 million to the general fund for the police, and I continue being surprised about it. La policia firmado durantemeses que noi di nero di para los Angeles. Our police have affirmed that for months there hasn't been any monies available for services that our communities need so that we can be safe and healthy. Pero de alguna manera en as ultima semanas, la cuda en contrado venticiete Dolores. But some way, somehow in the last few weeks the city has found $27 million so that they can use on the police financing. The police doesn't give us any safety and does not respond to our needs that our communities have. I asked that the city withdraw the $27 million for the police and invest that money in a water station outside the community community center in Maryville de los Centros de Ayuda, contrel calories de la Noche and Todolo Lugaris and expand the heat control help up to 10:00 in all places. Incluendo Personas sine status legal taxes and I request that legal services, permanent ones, be provided to people that are facing eviction, including people that don't have a legal status because well, we do pay taxes as well. En suvien estar en estar saludables y seguros en comunidades seguras. Our people need investment for their well being. That way they can be healthy and safe and be safe in our own communities. No necessitamos que le denmas general. We dont need that you give we dont need for you to give more money to the police nor do we need police because police is not safety. Gracias. Thank you kieran bianca proxima good afternoon mayor and council members. My name is Kiran Shah and I am a tempe resident. I'm here to support the take back my home campaign and to be the voice for the voiceless people. I am here to support the and to the 1 second, let me get right to council policy which is very important before any evictions. Housing should not be a privilege but a human right and UsA is world's most powerful and affluent country and its people are known for their generous hearts and service to humanity. So homelessness, in my opinion should not be tolerated here, especially seeing seniors and veterans on the street is really heartbreaking. So I would really request this house to approve the right to council policy and provide necessary services to prevent homelessness and evictions. Thank you. Bianca is next followed by evelyn.

Gracias. Good afternoon. My name is Bianca Romain and I come to this council here to request please that you help out the people that are at the freeway on ramps and also asking for help. We want these water stations outside of the city buildings outside of the Maryville Community center and for services that provide heat help. We want those services to be extended until ten at night for these people that are homeless and they need to be safe and out of the heat. We also want a permanent solution. Financing for a program for legal services for people that are being evicted, including people that are not here legally. And we don't want the $27 million to go to the police because they are not our safety. Thank you. Evelyn is next, followed by Olivia. Good afternoon, council and Kate. Mayor Gallegos. My name is first of all, they call me mom. My given name was Evelyn Larson. My last name is Kakache. I have a disorder and anxiety of the store and I apologize. My last experience in the last two years of being in my home. For 14 years, I've personally seen and known ten or more evictions in my apartment complex that has misplaced them or made them homeless. It made me want to be a voice that take back our homes. I heard it via Internet because my apartment is one of the older, not remodeled apartments. I knew I was next. I apologize for mismanagement of paperwork in the experience that I've had along with that I've ever been evicted left and right for a miskeeping of book work. There's been three or more management companies that has managed the tides. Known throughout Arizona. A monopoly of people. Very influential landlords and corporates. Big corporates hold a power in this community of housing. And I was left to fight alone because I was next. There's the five day notice. I was nervous. 14 years. I didn't want to be displaced and Evelyn go to court. I was all alone. I tried to find that legal advice that was helping me. She wanted me to sign their non disclosure agreement. I wanted a voice. I didn't want to be hushed. I want to be here for take back our homes and counsel. This is where you can step in. I didn't have the right and was told by my legal advice. Sign this NDA. I wouldn't do it. Thank you. You did great, Ed. I want the council to be heard. You have that proper defense to be able to make sure money is dedicated to this budget for right to counsel before eviction. Thank you. Olivia is next, followed by Sebastian. Good afternoon, council.

My name is Liv. I'm a resident of Tempe, but I'm in Phoenix frequently for both work and life. The council finding 27 million additional dollars to add to the police's already overinflated budget is really an affront to our community's needs. I reject that. 27 million going to police from the general fund and what we, the community are asking for is truly the minimum of what the city should be providing to keep residents and neighbors housed, hydrated and safe from heat. While we see that in the budget has some housing services and a few more water fountains. Special funding or seeking grants, which is what I heard last time I was here, was discussion of grants for additional water stations. That doesn't cut it when it comes to the most basic of human needs, water, shelter and heat relief. The city allowed over 600 preventable heat deaths last summer alone, and five water stations for 10,000 of our neighbors who are unhoused is a choice that the city is choosing to perpetuate. And it's not what your residents are telling you up here. Telling you that we need. Our community's actual needs are being directly thwarted by the police budget of nearly a billion dollars. Funding that should actually go towards funding eviction, legal services and prevention, including for those who are of multiple statuses and water, specifically for the water station outside of the Maryville community Center center, as well as additional heat relief stations. The police do not keep us safe. All the times I've been here, I've heard hours worth of testimony of your community telling you that police do not keep us safe. We don't need them, we don't trust them, and they inflict violence and death upon us and our neighbors. So, no, we don't want 27 million additional dollars to go to the police, fund our essential services instead. And I hope that this council will make the right choice by funding eviction prevention services, water and heat relief. Sebastian is next, followed by Arnab. Hi, good afternoon, members of council and mayor. My name is Ocien del Portillo. I am the campaign manager with takebacker Homes. And I do want to start by thanking city staff for all their effort in creating this budget. I also wanted to say thank you to the council members who have been communicating with us and working with us to figure out a right to council program. But seeing this new allotment from the general funds for the most inflated part of the budget is really disappointing when so much else needs to be funded in our communities. And I think that's plain to see for all of Phoenix. While there's a lot of good in the budget, it's still really far from what we need. And our take back our homes campaigns is asking you all to commit general funds to a right to council program that will keep thousands of families in their homes by simply giving them access to legal representation. We know that something like this levels the playing field in a really unfair eviction process, and similar programs that are like this one in Pima see favorable outcomes for tens 50% of the time through this year's budget process. We saw that asking for more funds for legal assistance and ultimately a right to counsel program was the most requested item in the budget cycle. So again, I fail to understand what's happening here. We need general funds for these programs permanently, not single time allotments. I think it's great that we have this ARPA money, but our communities are seeking a fiscal commitment from the city's treasury. These Covid funds are going to run out. So what are we going to do then? So we're in full support of the Pueblos budget demands. And the Pueblos budget demands are pretty simple. More water stations expand for relief centers, get additional money to where it needs to go, and I really, really hope to be working with you all to figure out our right to council program that's robust, well funded, and keeps families in their homes. Thank you. Arnab is next, followed by Alison hello, my name is Arnab Khabeer and I oppose the budget. The last time I was here a couple weeks ago, I was advocating for redirecting the unnecessary boost to the police budget towards more heat relief and the installation of more water fountains in the city, while simultaneously avoiding eye contact with the police officers in the room. After an hour of moving testimony about how more funding both divested from the police and invested in community programs would greatly improve conditions for those most need you. The council completely ignored any of that discourse and spent 20 minutes talking about only water fountains, which I've got to say is peak politics. Why we're increasing funding to a department that is still currently under investigation by the federal DOJ for wrongdoings against the most vulnerable of us, regardless of drug status, is beyond me.

And characterizing drug use as a crime instead of a medical condition doesn't reduce drug use, it ignores it. Permanent funds need to be allocated to the right to counsel because a victim of eviction's relationship to the legal system should be through a lawyer, not a policeman. We need more water stations like in Maryvale. We need longer heat relief hours. And one last thing to the audience, I want you to pay attention to what our dear council members have to say after everyone has spoken, because what they ask is indicative of their priorities. If they completely ignore a pivotal point brought up by speakers such as the redirection of police funding, they don't care what you have to say about it. And that is not the representation. Thank you. Allison is next, followed by Carrie. Hi, my name is Allison, and I live and work in the districts four and seven, and I'm here in favor of the Pueblos budget and take back our homes. Public safety is extremely important to me and members of my community, and public safety to us does not look like it's reflected in our city's budget. We don't believe that allocating more money to our police is going to help keep our people safe. What will help keep our people safe is giving them access to public resources like water and shelter and legal assistance in case of eviction. So, please, thank you for hearing us all out and allowing us to speak our minds. Thanks. Carrie is next, followed by Katherine. Hi, my name is Carrie Lorraine from district four, and I want to ask each of you, I'm hoping that you will look at us. Laura Pastor, Deborah Stark, Anna O'Brien, Jim Waring, Betty Guardardo, Kevin Robinson, Carlos Galinda Alvira, and Kesha Hajj Washington. Why did you want to be on this council? Why did you want to be mayor? I thought you wanted to do important work. I don't think you just want to look like you're doing important work. You know what we need. I know you know what we need. We need housing, transportation, infrastructure, medical care, obviously including mental health care and treatment, education, emergency crisis care and employment. We all know the absence of these causes crisis. Why are we creating a sick community? Why are we creating more targets for more people with more guns? Why are we giving more guns to people to target us? At what point does more police become a prison state? At what point how many police makes us a prison? I'm just wondering if we looked at other countries and thought, should we be like them? Which countries are those? I would like to know who you are serving. I would like to know if you care about us. I believe that you do. But your actions by giving 27 more million dollars to an agency that already has a billion is not taking care of us. Your job is to serve our needs. Your job is to create a thriving community. And there are a lot of us who are asking you to serve us. We are gathering more. I know you see us. Please stop giving money to the police and give it to our communities. Instead, we've asked for a water station outside the Maryville community center. We've asked you to expand the heat relief center hours until 10:00 p.m. we ask you to permanently fund legal assistance for people who are being evicted, including people without legal status. And we ask you to stop arming people who want to kill us and imprison us. I don't think that's the point of our life. Katherine is next, followed by Rebecca. My name is KD. I am 26. I've been living in district four for 13 years, working here for eleven. I live with my mom, who is on disability. When I was twelve, my mother was assaulted by her ex husband and his girlfriend. At the time, I witnessed the entire altercation, and after picking pieces of glass out of her back, I called the police. For some reason, I expected superheroes to come and save us. Instead, after very brief conversations with the adults involved, my mom was shoved into a squad car and taken to jail, while I was left in the custody of my abusive father. Because cops are abusive and they side with abusers, they don't speak the language of a disabled single mother. They didn't care about her side of the story. In 2020, when the world fell into chaos and my mom struggled to make sense of it all and try to hold onto her home, she failed to hold onto her sanity. And when she was so overcome with anxiety and experienced a mental break that put her into the most vulnerable position, I didn't know who to call. If I called 911, I knew that that horrible memory of being arrested would push through her broken mind and put her into an even more frightening state. But who else was there to call? My money from working nearly half my life goes to that simple three digit number that I was taught to remember as a child in case I ever needed help. But if we don't. But we don't need that kind of help that they give. We don't need you to invest in and prioritize the police. You need to invest in and prioritize the people.

Because cops are abusive and they side with abusers, they don't speak the language of a disabled single mother. They didn't care about her side of the story. In 2020, when the world fell into chaos and my mom struggled to make sense of it all and try to hold onto her home, she failed to hold onto her sanity. And when she was so overcome with anxiety and experienced a mental break that put her into the most vulnerable position, I didn't know who to call. If I called 911, I knew that that horrible memory of being arrested would push through her broken mind and put her into an even more frightening state. But who else was there to call? My money from working nearly half my life goes to that simple three digit number that I was taught to remember as a child in case I ever needed help. But if we don't. But we don't need that kind of help that they give. We don't need you to invest in and prioritize the police. You need to invest in and prioritize the people. The disabled singled mothers who raise good, hardworking kids. You have proved that your priorities do not align with those of the people. The people want safety and freedom and healthcare. All you give us is fear. Expensive fear. Please don't invest another 27 million in fear. And invest in our health and safety instead. This is the desert, and every year it's only getting hotter. We don't need more guns in this wild west. We need water. Thank you. Rebecca is next, followed by Isabel. My name is Rebecca Denis. I live in district seven. I would really appreciate if you all look at me and acknowledge my words while I'm speaking. Often you don't. I oppose this budget. I oppose the 27 million increase from the general fund to the police. Stop giving them our money. Money our communities need to be safe without the risk of violence and brutality. I demand that the budget include a water station outside the Maryville community. Sander, please expand the heat relief hours until 10:00 p.m. at all locations and permanently fund legal assistance for people who are being evicted, including people without legal status. Pretty much everybody here today has had an issue with housing, and I would bet that most people in Phoenix are struggling. It's extremely discouraging to consistently keep showing up here, begging this city and this council to put human life first and prioritize the basic needs of the constituents of this city. But I'm here, and I'm gonna keep showing up because I love this city that I grew up in, and I love the community that raised me, and I wanna see them thrive. That community was poor and working class, black and brown people, immigrants, disabled folks, elderly, even addicts. Folks that needed resources and often didn't have them. But we showed up for each other and we provided for each other, but we deserved more. I wanna see not only them, but all people in this city thrive. And the way to make sure that we have a healthy city is to center the most vulnerable and address the root causes of issues as a priority. I wanna speak to the gentleman that came up here earlier and talked about La Pradera Park. I also grew up in that neighborhood. My grandmother lives in district five. I am there almost every single day because at 92 year old, she needs an immense amount of care. I had birthday parties at La Pradera Park. I know what it's like to drive in the neighborhood that I grew up in and see people homeless and see addicts on the street. My loved ones are addicts. They're in prison. They are homeless. I can tell you right now, criminalization, more policing, the threat of going to jail, has done nothing to help them, has done nothing to deter them from using drugs, because the root causes of people that use substances is trauma. And we need to heal that trauma, and that comes in the form of resources. Thank you. Isabel is next, followed by Laura. My name is Isabel, and I live in district seven. I'm here to express my disappointment at the city's 2024 2025 budget. It's frustrating, infuriating. It's heartbreaking to know that police have been allocated an additional $27 million from the general fund, which is unrestricted taxpayer dollars that should be used to house unsheltered people and legally protect tenants who are facing eviction. In this proposed budget that you all are voting on today, we don't see any permanent funding for the emergency Eviction Legal Services program that many people asked for to legally support tenants whose rights are being violated and who are at risk of becoming homeless. I'm here as a Phoenix resident and as part of the Pueblos budget campaign to demand that city council stop giving police the money that my community needs to be safe and healthy. We are asking the city to permanently fund legal assistance for people who are being evicted, including people without legal status. The city must also provide protection from extreme heat to unsheltered community members. Immediate ways the city can do this is by putting a water station outside the Maryville Community center and expanding heat relief center. Hours to 10:00 p.m. at all locations. Stop giving our tax dollars to police. Invest it back into us and our neighborhoods to address root causes and meet people's immediate needs. Laura is next, followed by Alma.

I've called many times the police and been to different meetings because people speed really bad there. They've already run over four of my dogs, one of my cats. They've crashed into my truck, totaled it while I was parked outside, and has been two car accidents, flipped and everything. I have reached out to get help, and I don't get it. That is the number one thing I want to talk about. Please help me with that. I already talked to you already before. I haven't seen any change, any speed radar, cars there, any speed bumps. I've tried. Second of all, with the people that are sitting here in the council. Remember, you guys are elected by us. The people. Please give us respect. I've been sitting there looking at you guys, looking at a computer. I don't know what you guys are doing there, but remember, you are elected by us. And we will go out there and we will knock on those doors in the heat to get you out of those chairs. Do not estimate the power of the people.

Not super well, but a little bit. Okay. I hope that's better. That is okay. Thank you. I'm coming to you today to request that you guys fund our right to counsel. The eviction process as it currently stands is injustice. It's a business center to profit off of it, for landlords to profit off of. And if what I'm saying sounds outrageous, let me just examine one of the financial matters of one eviction. I have a 63 year old veteran who had a monthly rent of 1340 a month, and then after eviction, was owing 6000. $6,049.76. Now, if an eviction process is meant to remove a person from that dwelling, what on earth do we have any reason to now put something on a person's record that will not allow them to find housing after they've been furthermore, the trauma and everything else that they go through, losing all their belongings. I thought the purpose was simply for the landlord to remove the person out of the dwelling. And yet it is so much more. So much more. The landlord profits enormous off of a tenant who no longer has any place they can call safe to live. We need the right to counsel, and it should be hidden to us. In state statutes, I believe. 40 114 91.32. It states that on application by a person alleging a discriminatory housing practice or by a person against whom a discriminatory housing practice is alleged, superior court may appoint an attorney for a person. Now, it also is a federal statute that anybody indigent would have the right to counsel. Well, everybody qualifies as indigent when they have no money to pay their rent. Thank you. Cindy is next, followed by Christian. Hi, yes, my name is Cindy Ramirez, and I'm here today just to let, to let you know what's going on in the right steps to make sure that tenants face an eviction, SM representation.

So let me just educate you on something. Did you know senior citizens are the highest rate of homelessness you have here in Phoenix? I've done the research. I hope somebody in your cabinet does the research. All I'm asking is, you know what? When I had that management company going there, they didn't show up. My manager wasn't there. You know who was there? Their attorneys. Who did? I have. I had me and it went so fast, I didn't even know what happened. So if I could not. And I wasn't paying my rent because I'm a deadbeat. I did not pay my rent because they gave me such a large $500 increase in my rent that I was unable to pay it. So my choices were grab a shopping cart, hit the streets of Phoenix, and get a cardboard box, or move in with my abuser. I moved in with my abuser. I'm 61 years old. I should not have to live like this. You guys were elected into office because we voted you in. Now it's time for you. Come on, Kate. It's time for you to stand up and take care of us.

Good afternoon. My name is christian Soto, and I'm here today take back our homes campaign. I've been living here in Arizona for the past 20 years. Growing up here, I always faced a lot of instability in regarding to housing. We never stayed in one home for too long, and it was a fight to keep the lights on all the time. Our rent was always too high and too many of my friends and family have gone through the eviction process here. At one point, me and my family had to move out of state because we can no longer afford to stay here in Arizona. It was extremely difficult and hard for my family and I to always try to survive. After a year, we finally decided to come back. And even though the housing issues aren't any better, this is our home, and that's why we're advocating for the investment into affordable housing. We have one of the fastest eviction processes in the country. Not having an attorney is a huge factor in this problem. Leaves tenants with no protections against evasions that may be may not be lawful rent control. And strong tenant protections, like a right to cancel, can help slow the crisis down by keeping more families in their homes. And we're also demanding to stop giving so much money to police that could really benefit our community. More. More must be done in order to ensure families and neighbors stay housed in communities to which they belong to. Thank you. Thank you. Bronnie is next. And you. Can anyone hear me? Yes, we can. Okay. Hi, my name is Franny Cudgel. I'm here to support the right to cancel. That's a right that we was born with, really. It's almost like a birthplace I was illegally being. And yes, right here in Maricopa county, central city south, it was a landlord's issues, making fraudulent document, whatever ledger or whatever. On the day that my mom passed, it was the other tenant. I came home and just noticed some of $5,000. And I'm knowing I'm paying rent every month for the past four years. I just came out of homelessness. I'm a super fabulous volunteer for city of Phoenix since I was 14. I am a senior now, so they know me well. Even at plea, that was one amazing organization that I don't have a problem volunteering. So I don't do the city of Phoenix. I like to volunteer. I don't want to get paid. Even though I'm low income, living in public housing for the first time. Well, I experienced homeless because of this, without counsel. I was never even asked, do I owe this on tape, in court and on my memorandums, I said I do not owe. The landlord made up all kinds of stuff, but I didn't have a right to speak. So I did an appeal because the judges ruled in that person's defense. And I paid all this money living in central City south and public housing, that revitalization unit that the city of Phoenix owned, it ain't but one property. It's public housing. That's Phoenix City. Phoenix still owns was not part to figure out which one. In the city of central city south, right behind these courtrooms, in jail, I worked a lot volunteering with Chicana, Pulacasa, emergency shelters, cast police, you name it. Thank you. Thanks so much for your volunteering for our team. Have we missed anyone registered to speak? All right, we have not. All right, councilmember, comments? All right, roll call. Council win Hodge, Washington. Thank you, mayor. I just thought it might be helpful.

Council win Hodge, Washington. Thank you, mayor. I just thought it might be helpful. I would ask the city manager to kind of go over some of the things that we've heard today and address them, specifically the 27 million to police. Can you once again explain how that was derived? Yes, mayor member, council washing. Councilwoman Hodge, Washington. As we talked two weeks ago, several things have put additional upward pressure on our general fund operating budget. The primary big drivers obviously are, the cost of our employees has increased exponentially as a result of our class and compensation study, just to make sure that we compensate our employees with what the market pays for the jobs that we do. That added about $52 million worth of cost to the general fund based on our analysis that we walked you through when we presented the multi year forecast, we also had an increase in pension costs of about $30 million. We also had increases, significant increases in our vehicle costs. You know, the cost of vehicles have gone up exponentially, which is why we opted this year to move the cost of our firefighter vehicles, our fire apparatus, our ladder trucks and ambos to capital funds rather than the general fund operating budget. So we're, we moved $21 million from fire's operating budget to their capital budget in this upcoming budget, 24 25, as well as in 25 26, totaling $42 million. So the largest driver, honestly, for police is the cost of our employees as well as the pension costs. We've also, some of the things we've heard today about water fountains. We have added some water fountains. Obviously, there's always room for improvement. We do have 380 water fountains throughout the city. About 186 of those are in city parks and the rest would be in city facilities. Most of them are chilled. About 290 of them are chilled water fountains. We are continuing to look for additional grants and funding opportunities to provide more chilled water stations throughout the course of the city. And we will, we've invested a lot in homelessness and affordable housing, and we'll continue doing that. We've reallocated ARPA funds as we've gone through our strategic plan every six months. Our next reallocation exercise will happen this summer and we will look to continue funding those things that some of the folks have mentioned today. But the primary thing that we've looked to sustain are the costs of, you know, focusing on and serving our unsheltered population. And then just one more follow up, you got to the other item that I was going to ask you. So I just want to talk a little bit about the tenant Eviction Assistance program, which is the city's collaboration with community legal services to provide the right to counsel to individuals facing eviction. The city has been doing that since July of 2020 and we have a budget allocated for that correctly, correct? Sorry, we do. It's funded primarily through general fund and CDBG funds, if I recall correctly. And we, like any other program, we are monitoring that to see if cause one of the issues that was brought to our subcommittee, economic Development and housing subcommittee, and one of the things I specifically asked the department to go back and consider is understanding what it would look like to expand that and what it looks like. So I just want those in the assembly to recognize that it's definitely something that is moving forward in the process. It may not be implemented here in this budget, but it is moving forward. And then my other question is at this juncture, if it comes a situation where we see a depletion of the allocated funds for the teap. There is going to be opportunity to reallocate additional funds. If necessary, we can make a supplement. That is true. That's correct. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. Councilman Galindo. Alvirah. Thank you, mayor. Ma'am, I want to the veteran who toward the end, first of all, thank you for your service. And immediately following this meeting, I would like to sit down with you if you have time, ma'am.

We welcome a great group of commissioners from a variety of positions. Tourism and hospitality boards, sister cities, village planning commissions. Thank you all for being willing to serve the city of Phoenix. Next, we go to the liquor license portion of the Phoenix City council meeting. We serve in an advisory role to the state of Arizona on liquor licenses. Councilman Ansari, do you have a motion on liquor licenses? Motion to approve items six through 24. Noting that item twelve is as revised and located in district one. Except item 23 2nd. We have a motion in a second. Any comments? All those in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Aye. We next go to item 23, which is in Councilwoman Hodge, Washington's district. Councilwoman, would you like to make a motion. Or would we like to hear from the speaker first? All right. We have testimony from Raleigh. This is the venue on 7th. Thank you and good afternoon, Mayor Gallegos and council members. This is Raleigh Dombeck. On behalf of Garfield organization twelve. 1204 East Roosevelt Street, Phoenix, 85006. And we just wanted to go on record that we are opposing this particular liquor license. Due to the uniqueness of the property itself. Because it is bounded by adot property. With a freeway entrance ramp on the west. And adot interstate ten to the north. And a private business to the south. And then on the east side, it opens up to the residential area. It has other complexities that are a little bit different for its normal commercial zoning. So we just feel it would be prudent for the residents to have more information than just passing the liquor license without an actual plan. The application that we reviewed, unfortunately, we missed the. The 22nd for the opposition comment, and the application seems to have recycled plans from Prescott Valley, and we're unsure of what that is. And just due to the. Again, the uniqueness of the parcel itself, we feel that it would be more prudent to have more information before supporting this. Thank you. Thank you for that testimony, Councilwoman. I just have a few questions you can clarify. Based on the comments that were made by the speaker, can you address some of their concerns about the location? Is it unorthodox? Sorry. Go ahead. That's okay. Thank you. Good afternoon, mayor and members of the council. I'm Kristin Benavidez, representing the city clerk. This particular liquor license is for a new series six license, which is for a bar, and it's within a hotel. This liquor license would allow the consumers to purchase the liquor within the bar, but consumed throughout the hotel. The location itself is currently vacant land, and it's not uncommon for this type of license to be associated with a property similar to this. The location obviously has not been previously licensed for liquor sales, so there's no interim permit in place, and it would require a use permit to allow a bar, outdoor dining, and outdoor alcohol consumption as well. Thank you for that clarification. And with respect to without an actual plan, I presume that when the time is right, the plan and development will receive some information, and that information will then be relayed to the community for input.

Pastor. Yes. Robinson, waring. Stark. Yes. Gallego. Yes. Passes 90. City clerk. Are we ready for ordinances, resolutions, new business planning and zoning? Yes, mayor. Vice mayor, do we have a motion, motion to approve items 25 through 93, except the following items two 5333-448-6165 and 93. And can the clerk confirm if there are any other items that should be be excluded for in person public comment? Yes, Mayor. Members of the council, also excluding items 60, 61, 62, and 80, that would be items 60, 61, 62, and 82nd. Thank you. We have a motion and a second roll call. Ansari. Yes. Guardado. Yes. Hodge.

Ansari. Yes. Guardado. Yes. Hodge. Washington. Yes. O'Brien. Yes. Pastor. Yes. Robinson. Yes. Waring? Stark. Yes. Gallego. Yes. Passes eight one. We next go to item 48, the foreign language interpretation and translation services. Vice mayor, move to approve item 48. 2nd, we have a motion and a second councilman Guardado has a comment. So, mayor, I just had a couple of questions. Not exactly sure if it's Dan or who it would be. We will ask our city communications director, Dan Wilson, to come forward. Dan, can you just clarify for us what is it that we're doing today? This would extend. Mayor, members of council. Councilman, our councilwoman Modardo. This would extend an already in place contract for an additional six months, getting us through October. We are currently in a procurement process to develop a qualified vendor list. And this would get us that contract through while we develop that list. So I guess for me, just given what happened yesterday at the meeting, I know that, Lori, I've voice concerns to you. I think I've talked to Jeff about it as well. You know, when people take time off work to come to the city, it's not easy for people to come out here. And sometimes it's not even easy to speak in public about different things that they are going through. And they come here, they lose money because they have to lose money from working that day because the meeting is a little bit too early sometimes for them. And then they have to pay parking, and then to come here and feel that they're not being heard because the translation is not being done correctly, I think that is profoundly disrespectful. I found it very easy to work with Mario Aragas and with Elisa Duarte. I think they've been great to work with. But, I mean, it was a little bit embarrassing to see what happened yesterday. Here on the dais and what's happened in the past. So for me, in order to be able to support, the reason I did the second is for me to be able to support this item today, I just want to make sure that we're able to stipulate in the contract that for the extension then nor Gloria San Miguel or Carmen Cota will come in and translate again, is that something that we're able to do? That's something that we could look into, certainly, but the extension of the contract allows us to continue with Mario and Elsie. We'll look into whether we can, you know, whether we can put restrictions on that. I don't know the answer to that. Mayor, members of the council, I think some of it will depend on availability as well. So again, we can talk to the vendor and talk to the contractor to see what we can do to make that request palatable. But I think the one thing we also just have to remember is I don't know how many folks are under her in that contract because it is glorious company. So I think one thing that we just have to be mindful of is whether or not they have someone that can actually step in and fulfill that role while we're still under contract with them trying to support your request.

We'll look into whether we can, you know, whether we can put restrictions on that. I don't know the answer to that. Mayor, members of the council, I think some of it will depend on availability as well. So again, we can talk to the vendor and talk to the contractor to see what we can do to make that request palatable. But I think the one thing we also just have to remember is I don't know how many folks are under her in that contract because it is glorious company. So I think one thing that we just have to be mindful of is whether or not they have someone that can actually step in and fulfill that role while we're still under contract with them trying to support your request. And mayor, councilwoman, members of the council, what I do think that we can do is stipulate that we will prioritize the interpreters of our preference or ask them to prioritize the interpreters of our preference. And I think that should be something that we can do. So if that's the position that we're taking, then I think we should add into the contract that if folks that are coming in that are being translated for don't feel comfortable with the person that's translating for them, they should be able to bring in their own person, their own translator. Yes. And mayor, members of the council, that is something that we do by practice on occasion anyway. And so we could do that if that's necessary. So if we can do that, if we can stipulate those things, try to prioritize Mario and Miss Duarte to be the people that come in and translate. And if for some reason there are not, look, I get it that it's not easy to translate. I'm not one that volunteers to do it because I know that it's a hard job to do. But at the same time, when people are up here and they're telling us their stories and they're telling us their challenges and their issues, we should be mindful that we need to have someone that can relate the message that the way they want it to be related. So if we can stipulate that, if we can say, we will try to prioritize them. But if they are not comfortable with the translator, that they can bring in their own translator, I can be okay with this. Is that something we can do? Yes, mayor, members of the council, that is something we can do. Okay, thank you. Thank you so much, councilwoman pastor. I just need to get some clarity. I think what is being asked is that there be a variety of translators that are able then to translate clearly a bilingual translator, and is able then to translate in and capture the whole story and be able to then keep the rhythm that needs to keep going as it goes to the translator. If they don't feel comfortable with the translator that is translating, what I just heard is that then they can ask somebody else who they feel comfortable to translate. I want to make that clear. Yes, mayor. Members of the council. Councilman pastor, that is accurate. If they don't feel comfortable with the translator, provided, they could bring a family member or a friend who could provide that interpretation for them. Okay. I just want to be clear because yesterday that was asked. And so from here on out, I want to be able to understand what the rules are. Okay. And as I understand best practices, it's to try to have a neutral translator who is accurate. So can we always start with our translator, and then if it is inaccurate, but only if it is inaccurate, we would move on to a second alternative. But if we can, if the city is able to provide an accurate translation, that would always be the first place we would go, which just makes it easier to run the meeting. Members of the council, as I understand it, that is an accurate best practice. It would be the direction of the council to tell us if it needs to be an accuracy determination versus the preference of the person speaking in their native language. Okay, mayor, sorry, Councilman Guardado. So can you just explain? Okay, so we are going to move on. We're going to say preference Mario en Miss Huarte. If the translator doesn't feel comfortable with the person that's translating, then they can bring in their own person. If the translation starts, I mean, I'll be able to see it from the dais and say, this is not moving in the right direction. Then they can go ahead and pick their own person. Mayor, members of the council. Council Menguardado. It is my understanding that it has been our practice. If there is someone who doesn't feel comfortable with the translation, that we've been able to allow them to have their own translator, provided they have someone who can do that for them. It would always be our preference to start with our contracted interpreters to provide the service first. However, if there's an issue with that, for whatever reason, and I would. I would appreciate if the council would be able to provide some clarity on whether that is an accuracy issue or if that is related to the person's preference. But either way, we can accommodate allowing someone else to translate if that's a need. I mean, I think I'm comfortable with having our translators begin the translation, but if there's issues as we are moving forward, they should be able to say, we know that this is not being translated correctly. We want x person that's here with us to do that translation for us. Okay. Is that more clear? Yes. So it will be a decision based on we want accuracy in the translation. Right. I have a question, councilman. Pastor. So I'm just reliving yesterday, and I just want to make sure that the time that is given is within that time. So there's an inaccuracy in the translation, then they are asked to bring in, or they say, I want someone to translate.

Councilman Ansari move to approve item 62nd. We have a motion and a second. We have Jade Storm to provide comment. Hi. Good evening, council members. My name is Jade Storm Shamsiding. I am the president and founder of the neighborhood organization called mirror image that represents the young adults in six city districts, almost 1 million households. We are to inspire young adults to reflect leadership, utilizing sustainable passion and organic entertainment. It's been a very challenging year for the last 14 years. For me, and I am a little bit neutral in regards to approving this award. So I have a couple of questions that I'd like to see if you can answer, which can be stipulated into this agreement. In regards to number 60, does the RFP for this entertainment district stipulates any type of benefit for the residents in district seven and district eight? And if you don't mind asking all of your questions, and then we'll get staff to so, sure. And can the amendment of this contract include an outreach request for the Mirror Image foundation to be consulted with? And may the contract, if so, may the contract be coupled with an outreach outcome report after the consulting with the president of Miriamitch foundation? That's it. Wonderful. Thank you so much for those comments. We'll ask staff to come forward, and since she referenced district seven, we'll let councilman, sorry. Great. Thank you. Chris. Maybe you could start, if you could just outline what this contract exactly does, that would be helpful. Absolutely, mayor. Vice mayor, it would be my pleasure. This item was a request for a proposal that was issued through the city council and with a lot of public outreach. It started from a study that was done through our Phoenix Convention center for under Convention, Sports and Leisure that suggested three things to help entertain, help enhance our entertainment and downtown business. And one of those was to create an entertainment district. Staff did come to city council to bring forward a consultant to be able to help us identify those items in an entertainment district that would be important to the community, to the city council, to city staff in movement of the future of the community. So this really is the first phase of outreach of a consultant to kind of come in and look at downtown Phoenix and see what we're missing and where it is the city wants to go to and then help us create a path to get there. Wonderful. So we've selected the consultant that is going to be doing this. The commenter asked a question about does the RFP stipulate any type of benefits for districts seven and eight? Could you just talk a little bit about the public outreach being done and how a local business or nonprofit would benefit from this? Absolutely, mayor. Vice mayor. So as we look at it, the consultant will start their work and there will be a lot of community outreach. We're meeting not only with the signature stakeholders of downtown, we'll be meeting with community organizations. We'll be meeting. This isn't just a study for district seven and eight. We have many community members in district one and district six and district five and district four that are very interested as well. That come into downtown and use this as their heart of the community as well. So we'll be doing outreach across the entire city of Phoenix to bring the community into that. So those community benefits that we have, we'll be identifying those through the process. I think the outcome and outreach is to really help enhance the downtown community, to create the entertainment district that all of the city of Phoenix is looking for. Thank you. Chris and Jade Storm also asked about specifically outreaching to them. Could you or your team please connect with them to make sure we do that? Vice mayor? We will put them on our list of stakeholder groups that we reach out to as we start this process. Absolutely perfect. I think that's it for me. Thank you. Wonderful. Any additional questions? Roll call. I'm sorry. Yes. Guardado. Yes. Hodge. Washington. Yes. O'Brien. Yes. Pastor. Yes. Robinson. Yes. Waring? Stark? Yes. Gallego. Yes. Passes 90.

I did address all of my questions in regards to this. Wonderful. Thank you. And you had also pulled item 62. Did we get those questions as well? Yes, it was numbered in those orders. I do have one thing I would like to say. Throughout the years, I have spoken many, many times and have outreach with Chris. She knows me very well, has promised many things, and has failed to move forward with that. So if I could please get a response in regards to the last question that I asked, if. If there may be a contract awarded, can it be coupled with an outreach outcome from consulting with the Mirror Image Foundation's president, which is me. And so you're asking for a paid contract? If there is a contract awarded for this entertainment district to move forward, can it be coupled with a data outreach outcome from. From us being consulted with Chris and the team that is moving forward with this. Wonderful. And this is an item to amend a contract related to putting money into the housing trust fund? That's what we're on. Item 62. Okay, so could someone on our staff answer the question? Can we award procurements without a process from the Daisy mayor and council? No, we cannot. But we can commit to having a robust public process and making sure you are at the top of the email list. Thank you so much for the questions. And as always, the arts and culture program also has great grants for community arts leadership with a real emphasis on our youth.

The Michael Carbajal ceremonial, street name signage renaming. This is an item in district eight. I will turn to Councilwoman Hodge Washington to introduce the item and make a motion. Thank you, mayor. I'd like to make a motion to approve the Michael Carberhall ceremonial street signage. Street name signage. Second thank you, if I may, mayor. Among his many outstanding professional accomplishments, Ms. Mister Carberhall is a six time world champion, won a silver medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics in South Korea, was inducted into the International Boxing hall of Fame, and operates the Michael Carberhall 9th street gym just a few hundred yards from his childhood home. Today, Mister Carberhall is doing his part to contribute to the next generation of Phoenix boxers. His contribution to our city, the latino community, and the worldwide boxing community point to the living legend we have in our midst. While I was searching for community partners for my December community event, Mister Carba hall jumped at the opportunity to work directly with children. And I watched gleefully as he spent quality time with our community. Igniting a newfound appreciation for boxing, Mister Carbajal demonstrates that a kid who was, who wasn't born with a silver spoon can dedicate his time and talents to his craft and earn a place in history with golden gloves. At this time, I know there are audience members who are here and would like to say a few words. I would like to introduce former councilwoman and county board of Supervisors Mary Rose Wilcox. Thank you, thank you. And thank you, everybody. Hello. I would like to just really thank Kesha Washington for bringing this item up. And I think she said a lot of what all of us were thinking and are so proud of Michael and I would like to also thank our mayor and members of the city council for an urgent support for the naming of the street after Michael Carbajal, I know there's a lot of us who are going to speak, but there's a few who aren't. So, Keisha, with your and the mayor's permission, if they could stand up and be recognized, you'll see how many people actually support this. Is that okay? All right, you guys, when I was on the Phoenix City Council, one of the things that was one of my proudest moments is when Michael won the Olympic medal in 1988. I was on the council, and I was called by Michael's boxing team and asked to welcome Michael to the Phoenix sky harbor airport as he came in. And I knew it was going to be exciting. I knew there would be a lot of people. And by the time we got to the airport and the airport staff help", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Phoenix Community Outreach", "insights": [{"observation": "We are doing outreach across the entire city of Phoenix to bring the community into that.

And then by the time we welcomed him and got to his neighborhood at 9th Street, Michael, I think you remember, the street was packed with family and people, and everybody was just so proud of this young man who did the city proud. And Keisha mentioned quite a few of his accomplishments. But I think the greatest was the impact he had and the pride of our community. When our community could see that one of our own was making it and making it and giving back to the community by helping youth, as Keisha has said, it was wonderful. And kids looked at that and said, I want to be a boxer, okay? You got to have discipline. Michael would tell him, and Michael would make himself available for every everything that people asked him so he could show the children of our community you can be successful. So I'm really very proud of him. And I'd like to say one of the proudest moments for all of us in 2006, when he was elected to the International Boxing hall of Fame, joining boxing legends such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Joe Louis, Rocky Marshanos, Sugar Ray Robinson, Sugar Ray Leonard, sunny Liston, just to name a few. And finally, Michael Carbajal. So congratulations, Michael. And please, please vote for this. Thank you. Thank you, Mary Rose. I understand the councilwoman and team have been working very closely with Dino and John Montano, so I'll call them up in that order. Well, let me begin by thanking councilwoman Hodge Washington, as well as councilwoman, pastor, and councilman Robinson. And you, mayor. I mean, the reality for us is my private foundation has been very philanthropic with Michael and Laura and the team in just helping to kind of perpetuate a feeling of outward self confidence with the youth. Sometimes we forget that they're very impressionable and they don't have a place to go. And as a result, those impressions are something that somebody needs to look up to. I think for me personally, Michael and I have known each other for a number of years. We've traveled together. And the reality is I've watched people around him and I've watched how people act towards him. And the reality for me and my family is that we're behind everything that he has done. And for me personally, I look at him in the greatest of lights. He doesn't have to live on Fillmore, right? He doesn't have to be in that neighborhood, but yet he is. And the gym is. And people congregate around him. I was fortunate enough to travel with him recently to a fight in Los Angeles. And people even there know who he is. So he's an ambassador for the city. He's an ambassador for people that. That give him hope. And he perpetuates that hope. And, Michael, I just want you to stand and just let me recognize you for all that you've done for the city of Phoenix. Thank you, council members. I appreciate your support today. And thank you. Your family trust is covering the cost of fabrication and installation. Wonderful. We will then welcome up next, John, followed by rob. Thank you, mayor and council members. I'd just like to say Michael Carbajal is not only known here in Arizona. I've supervised world title fights all over the world for over 20 years. Everywhere I go, China, Australia, Italy, they all ask, where is Michael Carbajal? How is he doing? He was the most popular fighter in the 1988 olympics. I supervised every single fight that Michael has had in Arizona and some he's had out of the country also. But my greatest feeling for Michael is that a kid that made a million dollars could go and move anywhere. He decided to stay in his neighborhood, help the kids around there and bring all the kids to the gyms and give them something to work for. You've never seen a kid try to hold up a liquor store with a pair of boxing gloves. That's what these gyms do. This is what Michael does. He gives these kids something to work for and gives everybody else that comes in contact with these kids somewhere to grow up and be like the legend we have here in Arizona. Michael Carbahal, my young kid because I seen him since he grew up. First amateur fight until his last. Michael Carbahal. He is a legend in Arizona. And please, please approve this measure. Thank you. Rob is next, followed by Ray. Good afternoon. I was a police officer for 40 years, almost 36 years of that service was in Phoenix. And I started in 1979. I started walking a beat in Michael's neighborhood. And maybe I know him a little longer than some of the speakers, but I remember him walking around the neighborhood, and this neighborhood was not the showcase it is today. It was riddled with crime.

Michael Carbahal, my young kid because I seen him since he grew up. First amateur fight until his last. Michael Carbahal. He is a legend in Arizona. And please, please approve this measure. Thank you. Rob is next, followed by Ray. Good afternoon. I was a police officer for 40 years, almost 36 years of that service was in Phoenix. And I started in 1979. I started walking a beat in Michael's neighborhood. And maybe I know him a little longer than some of the speakers, but I remember him walking around the neighborhood, and this neighborhood was not the showcase it is today. It was riddled with crime. It was riddled with drugs. It was riddled with violence. When you're growing up in these neighborhoods, and I know this, there's a lot of temptations. He rose above those temptations. He rose above the peer pressure. He trained hard every day, and he worked himself into a world champion. Over the years, I've maintained a very close friendship with him. I don't know how many times we've been out to dinner. I don't know how many times we've been out to lunch. I've been to his house. I know his family. Whenever we're out, he is crowded with people. He is crowded with people that know him and a man of his status. The last time we went to lunch, we talked about sports figures that are a little aloof. This is not Michael. He's always got time to shake a hand, to take pictures, to hold kids, to sign autographs. I've watched him to develop into the champions today. It was about a year ago that he was touted in the Arizona Republic as one of the most known sports figures in the state when I was. Records are made to be broken. We know his records, but records like Babe Ruth records are made to be broken. But the legend stays alive. It's time to acknowledge and recognize him. Ray Buchanan, followed by EJ Hook. Hello. How you doing, mayor? Council members know just about all of you up there. I'm a city of Phoenix retiree. I worked for city neighborhood services for about 26 years. Retired nine years ago. Native Phoenician, homegrown here in Phoenix. Michael Carbajal is someone that I looked up to, even though he was about this big and still is. But I tell you, let's do him a great service and honor him by naming that street and his namesake, because he's done us wonders and honor all of his life. Representing Phoenix, Arizona in the boxing world, I would go speak to elementary schools on topics of. I ran a youth gang dropout prevention program for a couple years and I'd go over Mike's house, pick him up, and we'd ride to various classrooms and speak to the kids. And the kids were so honored and elated to see a champion. Michael Carbajal, boxing champion, known throughout the world, almost the same size as they are. You know, and I tell you, so let's just keep it real. Let's just pay it forward and honor him. And I'd appreciate and applaud all of you if you take the time out to do that. Thank you. Michael Carbaugh. Champ. EJ Hooks followed by Angelica. Hello, everyone. I decided to come in and speak on behalf of Michael Carburehal for everything he's done for my son, you know, and all the other kids that I see in the gym that come there every day to just even give a pound or even just to come take off that stress, or they may not get that love from other kids at school. Because some kids may be artistic, some kids may be, you know, I forgot the word. But less understanding than others, shall I say, more comprehensive. And also the bullying and the reason why I touch on this story so much because I wanted to start a program for any kids from the age of six to 13. But I also have a kid that's artistic myself. So it's a lot of work to do, but I'm here to do it. But I've been hearing around that some kids get, like, a niche, and when they find that niche that are artistic. One day my son woke up and he came to me and said, dad, I want to be a world champion. And growing up from Phoenix, Arizona, myself, I would hear about all these other champion and boxers. But there's one name that stuck out to me as a kid growing up in Phoenix is Michael Carvajal. Just hearing his name, hearing his name, even though I never got to meet him throughout my life growing up personally. But I'm glad that God answered my prayers because I asked for my son to have protection for himself no matter what, and just to be on the right side of that. But I had a friend that I went to school with. He referred me to Michael Carbajal here, you know, right down the street at Phoenix St. Mary's High school on 7th street. And just to know that I got referred to have my son come here, and he's been elevating ever since he's been coming. He's been, you know, going to regular classes with regular kids. He's been happy to come to boxing, practice, training, even if a kid don't make it professionally, I think it just gives them that confidence, you know? So I just love taking my kid there. That's a happy place. And I love seeing all the other kids there as well because they all, it's a real big team. So thank you. Thank you. And Helica is next followed by Francesca. Hello.

I think my son wanted to say something. Hello. My name is Jacob, and I'm, um. I live in downtown Phoenix, and Michael Carbajal is the best boxer I ever met. He deserves the street sign. Thank you. Good job. Well, that's going to be tough to follow, but please go ahead, and then norm will be our final speaker, and it had to be me. Good afternoon, mayor and council. I'm Francisca Montoya, and I'm here to speak on behalf of our hometown hero, Michael Carbajal. In 1988, Michael participated in the Seoul Olympics, and he got robbed. He came home with a silver, but he got robbed, and we all know that. And I remember when Mary Rose Wilcox and the Phoenix City Council had a big celebration downtown in Patriots park, which is now cityscape. And the entire city of Phoenix came out to celebrate Michael and to see his silver medal. I followed Michael's career since before going to the Olympics. And when he came back and turned professional, I followed his career as well. I had the privilege of being at his fights in Laughlin in LA, Mexico City, and had the privilege and the honor of being present when Michael was inducted into the Boxing hall of Fame in New York. That was such a special moment to have Phoenix represented in that museum that will live forever. Michael still lives in Garfield, in the same house that he grew up. And I think that that is commendable for anyone who has received the kind of fame and attention that he has. And he continues to live in the neighborhood that he grew up. Years ago, when I was working at the Stardust Resource and learning center in south Phoenix, I went to Michael's house and knocked on the door. Michael answered, and he agreed to come and speak to our youth, and he brought his belts, and it was such a special moment for the kids. This is long overdue, but I'm glad that it's actually happening. So thank you so much, and please approve action item 65. A tough act to follow, but you did it very well. And we actually have three more speakers, so Norm will be next, followed by Sergio. I'm Norman Fraunheim, former Arizona Republic sports writer, and I had the good fortune to cover Michael's career. And I just want to say, legacy is a terribly overused word. I've grown to hate it, but it still lives through its true definition in Michael Carbajal. And it's appropriate that a street be named after him. He grew up in the organic mom and pop Jim came out of that gave Phoenix a lot of international exposure. And now Phoenix has become a major stop worldwide for all these major promoters. And there's one that I'll tell you about. His name's Eddie Hearn. He's from London. And he came up to me the last time he was promoting in town, and he said, you know, this city has some of the most educated fans I've ever been in. And he has promoted everywhere. And he goes to me, he says, why is that? And I said, it's because of Michael Carbajal. Thank you. It's an avenue. He represents an avenue, if you will, to what this city has become and from where he's from. Please pass the resolution. Thank you. All right, Mister Saldana. And then Vanessa will be our final speaker. Good evening, everybody. My name is Sergio Saldanya, and I am a fighter that been training at the gym for quite some time now. And all I got to say is that I hope this gets approved because Michael deserves it. Honestly, he has, you know, changed my life, you know, and boxing has been part of my whole life, and it has shaped me in many ways. And Michael has helped me through a lot, you know, and I started amateur fighting with him, and it basically changed my life, you know, from, you know, from doing bad to doing good. Now in life, I would say he has shaped most of the kids in the community and is still helping in the community. And who can say that, you know, Michael has been a champion, and even if you don't make it in boxing, in life, you can become a champion as a business owner in many ways. So I truly hope, you know, this gets approved. And thank you, Michael, for everything you've done to our community. Thank you. Vanessa will be our final speaker. Hello and good afternoon. This is my first time doing a public speaking, so I'm a little nervous. I just want to say I've lived in that neighborhood for over 20 years, maybe right across the street on 10th street in Fillmore. So I've been there since I was six years old. I've seen, like the police officer said, what it was back then and what it is now, completely different. So to persevere and go through that time and see what it is today is just. It's an honor, and I really do hope this gets approved.

I've seen Michael literally since I was a child, just shape that community, the students, everything that Fillmore street is, is Michael Cottrell. And, like, she also touched on Michael running around the neighborhood, literally. You will see him Monday through Friday running around that neighborhood. So, like I said, I hope this gets approved. He literally is a legend that is still standing, and I would love for him to see this come to life. Thank you for your time. I think she's a natural. We'll turn now to councilwoman, pastor. Thank you, mayor. So gonna give a bit of history. There's been history given, but probably a little bit more. Michael grew up in a tough working class neighborhood, 9th street, known as the Garfield neighborhood, where there is passion, heart, and love in this body. Other phoenix natives like myself can attest to this. You had to be in a fight or flight mode all the time. He then went on to have an outstanding hall of Fame boxing career, even representing us in the 1988 Olympics. He rose from the barrio, and he continues to inspire everyone around us. Michael opened the 9th street gym in 1993 to have a safe space in the neighborhood for the neighborhood kids and community members to give hope. I admire that he's still so involved, and he's giving back to 9th street and Garfield. Michael is also a graduate of North High School, attended Phoenix Union High School one year, and an edison alum. As a former Phoenix union board member and a current north high Mustang, it is incredible to see active community members like Michael come out to our doors. Councilman Garcia met with community leaders and Mary rose to begin this process. And I'm so excited and honored that Manitos de Pierna is here. I thank council member Hodge Washington for completing this. Michael, thank you for all that you have done for our city, community, state and worldwide, and for all the work you continue to do. Like you have said before, you hope to train someone who will eventually surpass you and break your records. I know that person will also be from the barrio of Phoenix. Thank you. Thank you. Any further comments, Councilwoman Hodge Washington? Bring us home then. Roll call. I'm sorry. Yes, guardado? Mayor, can I explain my vote? Please do. Thank you. I just want to thank Michael, your family, I mean, just seeing everyone from here, it looks pretty amazing. As someone that also grew up in the barrios, as someone that also needed a mentor, someone to look up to. Michael, you're making a huge difference in people's lives. Our community doesn't have the money, doesn't have the resources to go out and get a personal mentor. So having you as a mentor, having our youth here today, I have two small boys that definitely could use some boxing lessons. But at the same time, I see what you're doing with our youth. I see what you're doing with the future of Phoenix. And you should be so proud of all of your hard work and everything that you have done. You know, as someone that has mentored many youth here in Phoenix, there is a huge need. And thank you so much for joining all of us and for all of the work that you have done and for all of these children that are here and hoping to be like you someday. We cannot thank you enough for all of, for everything that you have done for our community. And I will be voting yes. Hodge Washington. Like Jacob said, michael Carbajal is the best boxer I've ever met, and he should have a street named after him. So I vote yes. O'Brien. Yes, pastor. From a Chicano to a Chicana. Si se puede si. Robinson. Mayor, if I can explain my vote also. Please do. Thank you, mayor. It was August 30 at about 315 in the afternoon because I looked it up on my phone, I got a text from David Salgado. And David, if you could stand real quick, David's retired Phoenix police officer. David texted. David texted me and says, you're going to get a call from Mary Rose Wilcox. Take it. I would take the call from me anyway, Mary Rose, but I did. And they told me what they were planning on doing, what they wanted, what they had hoped to do. And I was in support of it then, I am in support of it now. But it's interesting that Rob Septembre, Lieutenant Rob Septembre served the Phoenix police Department for 37 years, close a total of 40 years in law enforcement. And Rob worked that area, knew it, as did I, as did David. And there was a stigma attached to the neighborhood, as was alluded to by several speakers. But what was always good about it was someone like Michael Carba Hall. Michael was there. You know, you were in the middle of it all. Folks in the neighborhood would come to you, folks who didn't necessarily want to talk to the police. And there was always that sense of Michael doing the right things by the folks in the neighborhood and was always very respectful to the police. And it was something we really appreciated. So I was asked by Mary Rose, I was asked by David, or I was probably told by David, we've known one another for well over 50 years, s", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Michael Cottrell", "insights": [{"observation": "Michael has been a champion, and even if you don't make it in boxing, in life, you can become a champion as a business owner in many ways.

Pause in case anyone wants to step out of the council meeting, but you're welcome to stay for the whole time. It all right. For those of you watching online, a very large group, just a part of the council meeting, but looked like they were in a good mood. We next go to item 80, which is redundant and backup power. Do we have a motion on item 80? Move to approve item 82nd. Motion and a second. Diane Barker. Thank you, mayor. This is 80, right? I was blowing a kiss to Michael. I just said that I got to dance with Alexis Arguelles back, and I found out how gentle a boxer can be and good on his feet. And so I'm in district seven, and on this 80, I'm supporting 80 highly. This is the federal government's going to pay 75% of the city matching costs. I'm very much in support of sustainability. What they're doing is making sure we have generators for water pumps. That seems to be the larger amount of money. But last evening at the Roosevelt neighborhood meeting, I'm a member. The city did present the cooling center for Burton bar. I go to Burton bar regularly. I'm over there maybe even three times a week already. We have people that I think go in because of climate in the summer. We know how, how hot it gets. What they want to do is make a cooling center in there. And people that are homeless or they, you know, want to get off of into cooler area, they will expand. There was a little controversy in it, but, you know, I said, look, I go over there, we have a Phoenix police officer. We have security guards, and it seems like there isn't that much of a chaos or problem. This is a homeland. AdOT's told me it's a homeland security property right around Hans park. This sits on there. What I'm suggesting to you is we need to take care that the city, as a lessee on Hance park, is required to maintain that area. And I didn't know whether Burton bar is homeland Security, but as Ed Zuerker, who's now mag director, said, this is an aging property around there. It's important, very important to the whole valley, and let's make sure that it's sustainable. Thank you. Any comments? Roll call. Ansari. Yes. Guardado. Yes. Hodge. Washington. Yes. O'Brien. Yes. Pastor Robinson. Yes. Waring. Stark. Yes. Gallego. Yes. Passes 80. Thank you. And this is one of many items we have voted on today that help us prepare for summer and heat. We next go to item 93. 93 is a public hearing. I will open the public hearing. We have Paul Gilbert on behalf of the applicant. Anyone need to hear from Paul? I will close the public hearing. This is in council district seven. I will turn to Councilwoman Ansari. Thank you, mayor. I have a couple of comments to start. First of all, I just want to take a moment to thank Paul Gilbert, who represents keys to change pro bono, for his work on this case. Some of you may know I visited what was formerly known as the Human Services campus on my first day as being a councilwoman, just a couple hours after being inaugurated. And at the time, there were about 200 individuals living in tents around the campus in 2021. It's one of the issues that I've been most passionate about and most committed to working on. And we know that the pandemic exacerbated this challenge. When we saw unemployment and federal resources run out and evictions continue to rise, the next thing you know, we saw close to 1000 individuals outside of the campus. I really want to thank our residents for their patience and collaboration. I'd also like to thank city staff, volunteers, nonprofit partners, and everybody who has had and continues to have a role in getting people housed and into services in Phoenix, from fire to police to CBI and many, many unpaid volunteers who just do this work to show compassion and humanity. In Phoenix, it happened slower than we wanted because there were operational matters that we had to correct and thoughtfully implement while we do this work. We had block by block cleanups that were executed well and thoughtfully. How we provide safe storage and how we ramp up relief during the extreme heat season. I think to have an eleven three decision at the Central City Village planning committee and no appeals to this use permit is a real testament to our work and the collaborative work in achieving better conditions for all. I think 2023 was truly a defining year for collaboration and what we promised to surrounding neighborhoods and businesses. A safe, clean neighborhood that leads with services and responding to our homelessness crisis. We have our colleagues here on the council and city executive leadership to thank for that swift action. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention Gina Scott, Rachel and the entire office of Homeless Solutions for I think, what is the hardest jobs at the city of Phoenix.

We will go to the last portion of the meeting resident comment and I'll turn to our city attorney to introduce this portion. Thank you, mayor. During citizen comment, members of the public may address the city council for up to three minutes on issues of interest or concern to them. The citizen Comments session is limited to 30 minutes. The Arizona Open meeting law permits the city council to listen to the comments, but prohibits council members from discussing or acting on the matters presented. Thank you so much. We'll begin with Nicole Rodriguez, followed by David Bonilla. Thank you, mayor, and thank you, council. I just wanted to briefly comment on a few things today related to Vision Zero and also on housing. I know we have a pretty robust vision zero advisory committee, but I did want to point out to council and city leadership that currently we have a vacancy and also no females that are serving in a voting capacity on the Vision zero advisory committee. We do have three students who are non voting members. One is a female. However, we currently, unfortunately, do not have anyone representing from a perspective, from moms or anyone who is a caregiver, that is a woman and that is greatly needed on this committee as a voice. And it's critical to us understanding better on the needs of those who not only get around in vehicles, but also caregivers who get around in other means who have limitations and cannot drive our. Cannot afford to drive. This is, I think an oversight that was missed. But I want to make it known today if it is an oversight that we work harder to look at finding more women to engage on this vision zero committee, because right now it's just all men and the only public commenters are females. So I don't think a single male has commented provided public comment other than, I believe, one individual. But this is interesting and unusual compared to most other cities. So we need more diversity in that respect. The very last thing I wanted to briefly mention, I am greatly disappointed in the city's lack of support on House Bill 25 70. This is something that I hope then also the city prioritizes even greatly because we saw a lack of support for parking reform, whereas other states and cities are working hard to make sure that we are getting these needed reforms pushed through, whether on the staff side or from the public. And we were on the public side really engaged and willing to work on this matter with leadership. So we hope then I hope to see more action on this aspect for housing affordability moving forward because it's greatly past due and we got a lot of citizens who are willing to work and not be roadblocks and making better outcomes for everybody here in Phoenix. And with that, I would like to just close out my comments and thank you. Thank you. David is next, followed by Brian Willingham. Good afternoon, mayor and city council. My name is David Bonilla. I'm a cashier for SSP at Sky harbor. I'm currently on a leave of absence to work as an organizer for for unite here local eleven. So far, at least nine union activists have been fired from SSP America since they first went out on strike. If SSP thinks that they can scare us by singling out the most outspoken leaders, they're in for a rude awakening. Those tactics just won't work. Workers will not be silenced. But we are here today because SSP America is your contractor. They are your responsibility. Do you think that all the allegations of racial disparities mean nothing? We are asking you to investigate these issues, not just blindly take our side. Please put the issue of racial disparities at SSP on the agenda so we can have a real dialogue and get to the bottom of what is happening at SSP. Thank you very much. Thank you. Brian is next, followed by Julia. Mayor Gallego, vice Mayor, distinguished members of council, city manager Barton Lori Bayes. Thank you for allowing me to speak today. Most importantly, I want to talk to the members of the community. My name is Brian Willingham and I'm the president of the United Kings Firefighters Local 493, I stand before you today to address a critical issue that directly impacts the safety and well being of our community.

Most importantly, I want to talk to the members of the community. My name is Brian Willingham and I'm the president of the United Kings Firefighters Local 493, I stand before you today to address a critical issue that directly impacts the safety and well being of our community. I'd like to start by acknowledging the work you've all done over the past years to help with fire department resources, including six stations that were recently approved that will be built over the next five years, four inside the bond that many of you worked on. That's appreciated, and two outside. So I want to say thank you for that. It's not only needed, it's definitely appreciated. But that said, I think it's imperative that we draw attention to our residents, that they understand that this is a very sobering reality. Our city's fire and emergency medical services have not kept pace with our population growth for well over a decade. The consequences? Response times that are often hovering around nine minutes. The national standard is five. I urge you to pause for a moment and consider what nine minutes truly means. Count to 69 times. Count to 69 times and imagine the anguish of waiting for paramedics to arrive as your loved ones life hangs in the balance, or the terror of watching your home engulfed in flames, hoping for the for the swift assistance that we provide. We, the firefighters, are not here to simplify or simply voice our concerns. We are here with a genuine desire to collaborate with the city to find viable solutions. We recognize the urgency of the matter and are committed to working together to begin addressing these challenges in the coming months, no matter how long it takes and no matter how heavy the lift. I'd also like to take a moment to commend the city manager and his dedicated staff, all of you who supported the bond, and especially the community, for your unwavering commitment to keeping our city operational. Despite facing numerous budgetary constraints, Jeff Barton, Lori Bayes and their staff's resilience and resourcefulness has not gone unnoticed. And those of you who supported their plan, that has certainly helped as well, and we thank you for that. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the stark reality that's facing our fire department. In the past 15 years, we've only added one station, while our city has added hundreds of thousands of residents. Our firefighters have heroically managed to do more with less, but now they find themselves doing less with even less. We are stretched thin, and the strain on our resources as firefighters has reached a breaking point. In conclusion, I implore you to consider the urgency of this matter and to prioritize the safety and well being of our community in the coming months. Together, we can ensure that our firefighters have the support and resources they need to continue serving our wonderful city with the dedication and bravery that our residents so rightly deserve. There's one last thing, if I may add. The city's facing extreme circumstances. The state legislature passed last year a bill that eliminates the rental property tax. That's not our council's fault. That's not our mayor's fault. That's not our city manager's fault. No one's fault but the state legislature. That's a loss of $90 million to this city. We're already in a hole. We're in a sand trap, and it keeps falling back in. Home rule is on the ballot next November. I would urge you to look into how important that will be to not cap our spending and continue to be able to provide the funding and resources for sustainability for our fire department so that we can better serve your families. Thank you. I'll leave you at that very important testimony, but thank you. Julia is next, followed by Karina. Hi. Always learn a lot at these meetings. No? So mine are just a couple of concerns I've noticed. I live on East Hatcher Road in Sunnyslope. There have been four accidents because of speeding. And I've worked with the streets department. I did the speed study. They saw that there was excessive speeding, but because of the houses that are on that street, they're too low. We can't have speed humps, but we keep having excessive speeding and people getting to accidents. Before I met with the streets department a couple months ago, a woman was killed at an accident in the intersection. I've had other block watches come to me and say, we can hear people drag racing down your street, and we are very annoyed. I went up and down the street in the heat of the summer, getting petition signatures to do the study and then to get the speed hump. And everybody complained about the speeding. I have talked with other towns like Cave Creek, and they don't have a solution either for the dips, because we're in Sunnyslope, so we have dips on the road, but people still speed. They haven't found a solution. I've talked with all other cities. Nobody has a solution for speeding with dips. And I think that's something to look into because I know right now with the streets department, there's only the speed humps. And they took out, I think, the whatever you call the inner barrier thing, but just something to look into because it's going to continue in my neighborhood with the drag racing, and we hear it every night.

I call the tourism board, and I noticed for the tourism board, it's only people for the convention center and also that are hotels. There's no museum or anybody else on the tourism board. I know when I go to the herd, there are many people from out of the country, Japan, China, that go to the heard museum because they love to see the heard museum. There are people that travel from all over that went to go see the mystery castle. I think it would be good for the tourism board to explore the idea of having other places that are not just hotels and convention centers, but things that tourists like to see. I know that you guys own Tovara Castle, and that's a huge thing that people love to see and try and get tickets to every single year. So that would be something good to see on the tourism board. I know that we're still trying to find a solution for Mystery Castle. I'm still working on it. I know that now. I'm sure you've seen on social media, the albedo house on East Whitegates Drive is up for demo. There was 150 letters, I think, sent to the historic preservation office. Fox Ten News did a story on it. I know that won't be discussed till April 15, and I'm sure you guys will be getting letters about it, too. But we're losing so much Phoenix history right now, and it's really hard to fight these battles with just one person or a couple of people. And I know only have 24 seconds left, but just to find some solutions and to work on, you know, saving our Phoenix history. And I do want to say thank you to the firefighters. I know it's been hard for them in our area because our fire station is the smallest but the busiest. So just trying to find some solutions for historic preservation for the firefighters, for just the whole community as a whole. Thank you. Karina is next, followed by Tarian. Hi, Mayor and city council. My name is Karina Sims, and I am a member of USA Dodgeball. My issue is a little bit less presenting, but all of a sudden I basically am here to ask you guys what research resources you guys could provide me for dodgeball. I play competitive dodgeball. We're taking off, and one of the things we would like to do is provide the community with how it's played professionally all over the world. The members of the USA Dodgeball community I work with, we're trying to make it an Olympic sport. We're trying to make it a professional sport. And one of the things that we want to do as an organization is teach the youth how we play at a high level and make it more organized and give youth an ability to have another avenue to do things with their lives. Aside from the typical sports, one of the things that we are finding with dodgeball is that it fosters teamwork, involves communication, and it really gives a sense of community there for everybody. And it kind of levels the playing field because you don't have to be freakishly tall, you don't have to be freakishly quick. You just have to be crafty. And so that's one of the things we would like to give the youth and just overall, even young adults. So I'm here to ask you again if one of you guys could reach out to me at some point. I am talking with your parks and rec department and we're kind of trying to narrow down an area. But I would just like to offer the city, even in school tools and make it and get back to the art of playing dodgeball, because there is an art about it. There is a community that is passionate behind it, and I feel like Phoenix could trailblaze that for other areas to watch. So thank you guys. Thank you so much. It sounds like you're already on it, but our parks director is happy to talk further. Tarian is next, followed by Jasmine. Good afternoon, mayor, vice mayor and members of the council. As before mentioned, my name is Tarion Ross and a few things about me for context. I am a born bred cornbread and burrito fed Southside die hard. I'm a Clovis Campbell and South Mountain High School graduate, an ASU criminal justice dropout, current district eight resident, wife and mother of four. Today I want to speak to you about a topic that I am very passionate about, the redlining, sanitization and gentrification of my home and community. It has been historically documented that south and Southeast Phoenix were the only part of Arizona officially redlined by the federal government. Redlining didn't just keep black and brown people from buying homes and getting fair access to financial services. In my community, it led to fewer branch branches, more pawn shops and liquor stores, and even more petty lenders. It created food deserts. And in my community, it also created a lack of quality healthcare. My community is now being sanitized, and if you're unfamiliar with what that word is, it's when you all make the hood eco friendly. You make the hood easier to travel around and a lot more convenient for the new occupants that will soon gentrify the blocks and the streets that we call home, you'll make it easier for them. The blight that you call South Phoenix is not it. Our community staples are now being bulldozed and replaced with blackrock coff", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Mystery Castle", "insights": [{"observation": "Mystery Castle is still up for demo.

It has been historically documented that south and Southeast Phoenix were the only part of Arizona officially redlined by the federal government. Redlining didn't just keep black and brown people from buying homes and getting fair access to financial services. In my community, it led to fewer branch branches, more pawn shops and liquor stores, and even more petty lenders. It created food deserts. And in my community, it also created a lack of quality healthcare. My community is now being sanitized, and if you're unfamiliar with what that word is, it's when you all make the hood eco friendly. You make the hood easier to travel around and a lot more convenient for the new occupants that will soon gentrify the blocks and the streets that we call home, you'll make it easier for them. The blight that you call South Phoenix is not it. Our community staples are now being bulldozed and replaced with blackrock coffee shops, overpriced housing developments that we're still not giving loans to live in. And gates are being put up to keep us out and to keep them safe. It's the audacity for me. I don't understand how you all can sit there knowing that the government forced us to. South Phoenix deprived us of basic opportunities and decent standards, and then years later, allow your policies and gentrification to force us out. My only two questions for you today is, where do we go? What about us? By way of Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, South Phoenix, and Allenville, Arizona. I am my ancestors, and by any means necessary, you will do right by us. Thank you very much. Jasmine is next. Good afternoon, mayor and city council. My name is Jasmine Glass. I was a cashier at SSP America. I'm at Sky Harbor International Airport until just a couple months ago. The last time I was here speaking to you, I informed you that we had filed complaints with. With the attorney general and the Phoenix Equal Opportunity Department alleging racial disparities in promotion, pay, and hiring at SSP America. Just two weeks after I became a public whistleblower, I was fired from SSP. So far, at least nine outspoken union activists have been fired. We have filed charges with the federal Labor Board alleging that our disciplines and determinations are unlawful because SSP is applying their policies in a discriminatory way to target union supporters. The EOD declined to investigate our complaint while the AG's case is ongoing. Even though EOD has its own independent obligation to enforce the city's anti discrimination laws, it is unjust that the EOD is sitting on its hands and ignoring obligations to workers in the city. When will it be enough for this council to take what is happening at your airport seriously? The attorney general oversees the entire state, and they've reached out and met with us. Why isn't Phoenix taking this seriously? We aren't well off. Losing our jobs means dealing with being hungry and possibly homeless. Please, I asked you before to do what you can to ensure that our allegations of racial disparities are investigated. EOD's decision not to act without taking steps to investigate is unacceptable. Please put this on the next agenda so we can have a discussion. Show us that it matters what your contractor is doing, and hold them accountable. Thank you, mayor. Councilman, Pastor, can I ask staff a question regarding the EEOD? Mayor and council, we cannot have any discussion on an item that's not on agendized. Okay, but I'm asking a question there. They. I just want to know process. So. So at the next policy, which is on next Tuesday, you could do a request for information and that would be, I think. Okay, so next Tuesday I have to make a request for policy to place. Place this item on the agenda. There is an agendized item called council request for information coming up on Tuesday. So you could, I mean, you could just. We have to move on now. But there other opportunities. I'm a little confused. We can come to your office and give you a briefing on the. I don't need to come. I don't need you to come to my office. What I just want to understand, for the public to understand the problem process of what's happening with the EEOD and what I mean by that is why it was sent to somewhere else. So without getting into the specifics, as Julie said, that complaint that was brought, we can't do this right now. We gotta do it when it's agendized. So thank you. We'll go next to Nicholas, followed by Mark Rodriguez. Good afternoon, mayor and city council. My name is Nicholas Heathier. I'm a member of unite here. Local eleven was formerly a cook for SSP America at Sky harbor airport. We believe that our employer, SSP America, is punishing workers in a discriminatory way for their union involvement. So far, at least nine union activists have been fired from SSP America since we first went on strike. I myself was recently fired. SSP thinks they'll scare us out by singling our most outspoken leaders and they're in for rude awakening. Those tactics aren't going to work on us. Even though I've been fired from SSP, I will not be silenced and I will keep fighting with my coworkers because we are here today. Because SSP America is your contractor. They are your responsibility. Do you think that all our allegations of racial disparities mean nothing? We're asking you to investigate these issues, not just blindly take their side. Please put this issue of racial disparity at SSP on the agenda so that we can have a real dialogue about the issues and figure out if SSP is really the best company for the job and get to the bottom of what is going on at SSP. Mark Rodriguez is next, followed by Michael Smith. Hello, Mayor Kate Gallego and members of the Phoenix City council. It's good to hear from you again. This is my first time being on screen.

And we'll begin today with council member updates and requests for information with a councilwoman who's just celebrated a year milestone, Councilwoman Hodge Washington, who will be followed by councilwoman pastor. Thank you, mayor. Since our last policy meeting, I officially celebrated one year of service here on our city council. I'm honored to reflect on an incredible year serving district eight residents, and I am overwhelmed with gratitude. Next slide, please. From the successful passage of the $500 million go bond campaign to the countless moments engaging with constituents and participating in community events, it has been a humbling privilege. I want to again thank the district eight residents for entrusting me with this opportunity to make a difference. Next slide. Next slide. Okay, sorry. Over the past year, I've hosted energize eight roundtables, which are community centric meetings held around the district where residents met with department staff to collaboratively brainstorm professional ways to address community concerns. I also convened a district eight policy retreat with stakeholders and city staff to focus on housing, homelessness and economic development. Within the first few weeks of taking office, I took part in community budget hearings, listened to my community's concern, and supported the 2023 2024 budget. Next slide. My office has been hard at work addressing hundreds of constituent concerns and requests, and my schedule has been full not only with briefings and meeting, but I have attended over 250 community events. Next slide. I had the opportunity to lobby our congressional delegation by advocating for additional housing choice vouchers. I've worked to advance development projects to add over 1750 new dwelling units in district eight and supported ordinance changes to allow accessory dwelling units updates to streamline the development process and in turn, reduce costs. Being an engaged member does not mean just showing up to community events. It also means putting in the hard work into subcommittee meetings and other boards where I represent not only my district, but the entire city. Next step, next slide around the district in the last two weeks. I want to start off by extending a special thank you to our interim police chief, Michael Sullivan, TJ Martin from law and Zach Wallace from the city manager's office, and all of the residents in my district who attended my district eight town hall DOJ discussion. It was important to me to ensure that the community had a chance to share feedback with Chief Sullivan, and this forum allowed for a thoughtful discussion. I also had the opportunity to take part in the South Mountain Community College President's community advisory council. I'm grateful for the work that Doctor Richard Daniel is doing and I'm happy to support him as he diligently supports the educational needs of our community. It was a pleasure to see their new career center at South Mountain Community College and then next slide finally, I had a constructive initial discussion with the unsheltered providers to discuss their plans for the upcoming conclusion of ARPA funds. I'm sure there's more to follow. Next slide that is all I have for this week. As always, do not hesitate to contact or reach out if you need any help with city services or notice an issue in your neighbor in your neighborhood. Thank you mayor. Thank you councilwoman and congratulations. We'll go to councilwoman, pastor and then Councilwoman Gordado. Thank you.

The Carnation association of Neighbors used their park activation grant to host music in the park at Steel Indian. We had a great time with the firefighters and parks and recreation who brought games and a bounce house for the kids. As you can see, I'm in a firefighter suit which was very hot. They taught me a lesson on the wait. Also. Next slide summer is coming soon. Join me on May 22 at 06:00 p.m. at Tortas Paquima on Van Buren for a Westside community coffee chat to discuss the city's heat response efforts. Meet your neighbors and connect with the city of Phoenix resources while enjoying some delicious tortas and tacos. Saturday marked the 25th anniversary of Columbine. In the 25 years since, such incidents have become all too common. We've been working with Phoenix Union staff and students to learn more about safety concerns on campus and include safe reporting measures in the student handbook. Students deserve to have their voices heard and participate in changes like these. I'm so proud to see this project moving forward. As you can see, I'm very excited to kick off the launch of the international district with the Arizona Asian Chamber night market this Friday at the park and ride on camelback and 19th Avenue. There will be food, music, local vendors, cosplays and cars. You don't want to miss it because Pikachu is going to be there. More information on the asian chamber night market. See you this weekend. The Phoenix Fire department is launching a new logger and we're celebrating it on Cinco de Mayo at Bucci Bicho. And it's not. And it's not Viche. Join us for the food and beer. Proceeds will go to cancer programs for the firefighters. As always, contact my office and send me an email. Thank you. Thank you.

Let me begin by noting that this past Friday I was fortunate to recognize four district seven residents for their dedication to serving the community. Molly McCurdy represents the next generation of community leaders, bringing fresh ideas and energy to grant avenue and surrounding neighborhoods. Her initiatives, from organizing festivals to starting a block watch, are fostering a stronger sense of community and preserving the area's unique character. Blanca Minerva Jacome Perez is a shining example of community leadership. Her dedication to youth empowerment through cultural, dance and substance abuse prevention is commendable. She not only provides a safe space for at risk youth, but also addresses issues of food accessibility through gardening classes. Blanca Minerva Jacame Perez es e jemplar pusu lidarasco communitario su de dicaciona juvenes los empodera con valeto corico y contrabuso de drogas no Solomonte Judah sinotamien ha. Jessica McClimmons dedication to enhancing Hyde park is inspiring. She has spearheaded initiatives like mural installations, neighborhood branding and tree planting, all aimed at instilling a sense of community pride. Her tireless efforts, including personal investment, embodies the spirit of proactive community engagement and serves as a role model for residents looking to make a difference in their surroundings. Jeanette Arns is founder of Redeemed Neighborhoods, a beacon of hope in the fight against substance abuse, particularly among our youth in the Levine area. Through tireless outreach efforts, community cleanups and educational initiatives, she is effectively raising awareness about the dangers of drug use, including the lethal threat of fentanyl. Each awardee exemplifies the spirit of service and dedication to improving our neighborhoods. Congratulations to the awardees for their outstanding contributions to district seven. I encourage more residents to visit volunteer Dot Phoenix Dot Gov to learn more about how their volunteerism and how they can get involved in the community. Next, I want to extend my appreciation to the Phoenix Light rail team and Valley Metro for hosting the fiesta on central and South Phoenix. This past Saturday. I joined councilwoman pastor and together with over 300 attendees and 35 vendors, we celebrated. It was no coincidence that we both wore green. Green means go, and despite a do over election, a worldwide pandemic and supply chain issues, the south central extension is 80% complete. In the coming weeks, art fixtures, with a nod to the rich diversity of South Phoenix, will begin installation. It's important to note that this project would not have been possible without the steadfast support of former congressman Ed pastor. His legacy lives on with each stretch of light rail in Phoenix. If you're a resident of district seven and you're wondering how to get in touch with me, it's quite simple. Please feel free to reach out via any of the following channels. I'm here to serve you and I value your input immediately and immensely. Whether it's a suggestion for improving our community, a problem that needs addressing, or simply a question you need answered, don't hesitate to get in touch. Mayor this concludes my updates. Thank you. Wonderful. Thank you. Hitting the ground running. Any additional updates? All right then, we will turn to our final four update and I will introduce deputy city manager John Chan to kick off the presentation. Thank you and good afternoon, mayor and members of the city council. We are delighted to be here today to provide a recap of the successes and outcomes of the 2024 NCAA men's Final Four. Joining me at the table are Phoenix Convention center director Jerry Harper and city Major events administrator Eric George. Just two weeks ago, Greater Phoenix hosted the Final Four for the second time since 2017. March Madness concluded with the final game between Purdue and Yukon at State Farm Stadium being the third highest attended championship game in NCAA history. During Final Four weekend, downtown Phoenix played host to student athletes, coaches, alumni and thousands of basketball fans. As many of the community and fan facing events were hosted in city owned facilities, including our outstanding convention center and urban parks. We'd like to begin today's presentation with a short video highlighting the sights and sounds of the 2024 men's Final Four. I'm all about my business no apologies I run a laughing can't believe in this moment I'm free, I'm free I'm feeling good, good I'm gonna do I'm feeling good as you can see, downtown Phoenix was brimming with activity, and at this point, I'll turn it over to Jerry and Eric. Thank you, John. Good afternoon, mayor, members of the city council, thank you for this opportunity to talk about the successes of the NCAA men's Final Four. We're really excited anytime that we have the opportunity to come and speak to some of the finer details of these types of events, especially how it impacts the city and the valley as a whole. Joining me to my left is the city major events administrator, Eric George. And we're going to go through a number of different topics this afternoon as we wrap up this final four activities.

Thank you, John. Good afternoon, mayor, members of the city council, thank you for this opportunity to talk about the successes of the NCAA men's Final Four. We're really excited anytime that we have the opportunity to come and speak to some of the finer details of these types of events, especially how it impacts the city and the valley as a whole. Joining me to my left is the city major events administrator, Eric George. And we're going to go through a number of different topics this afternoon as we wrap up this final four activities. So one of the things we're going to talk about is media and exposure that this event brought to the valley. We're going to do a deeper dive into the attendance numbers. We're also going to talk about all of the events that happened in the city of Phoenix. We're going to speak to the public coordination between all of the city departments and downtown partners that helped to facilitate the activity that was related to the Final Four. And we're also going to speak to the social impacts. It's very important to the NCAA that when they go into a destination, that they leave a lasting legacy when they're here. And we're going to go into a little bit more detail about that. John mentioned that this is the second time that the men's Final Four was hosted here in Phoenix. I think that it's worth noting that prior to 2017, the last time that this event was this far west was in 1995, when it was held at the Seattle Kingdom. I say that so you know that it has been very rare for an event of this magnitude associated with the NCAA to come this far west, and the fact that we had them here in 2017 and just seven years later in 2024, really is a testament to the team that we have here together and how we're able to facilitate such a successful event that they were really excited to come back here and we're really excited to have them. Another thing that I wanted to talk about before we go into some of the numbers about the overall reach of this event, is to really speak to the impact that this event had on our hotels, particularly the hotels in downtown Phoenix. When you look at year over year numbers from the Friday, just before the Friday that the semifinal games were played through Monday, which is when the championship game was played year over year, occupancy in the downtown hotels was up 61%. ADR was up a whopping 115%. And if that sounds impressive, Revpar, which is revenue per available room, was up 240% year over year. That's significant. What's also significant is the amount of people that watched these games that were held out in Glendale at State Farm Stadium. As you can see on the slide, it was over 40 million people that watched both the semifinal and the final games. One thing that I want to note is ad agencies when they were purchasing 32nd ad space during the men's final four, that cost about a million dollars for the men's championship game. For the women's championship game, it was about $500,000, which is expected to go up as that event gains popularity. I mentioned that because we like to look at the men's Final Four as a week long commercial for the city of Phoenix and for the valley as a whole. And when you think about the number of eyes that were on this destination, not just from watching the game, but from watching all of the different sports channels that were covering the event, like everything that the local news networks from the teams that were lucky enough to make it here, the amount of reach and the amount of value for that week long commercial is almost immeasurable. When you look at the social engagements, what you see on the slide before you is really just speaking to the engagements. On the NCAA owned social media properties, just under 3 million. That's a lot of engagement. I really think that credit is due to the convention center's marketing team and the city of Phoenix's main communications office, because they also were very active. As soon as March Madness started through the end of the championship, their reach their engagements was over 42,000. And I think that that was significant because they really put a lot of work into not only delivering entertaining content for people to engage with them on social media, but informative content, because it's very important that we made sure that everyone here within the city of Phoenix knew how they could participate in these events, even if they were not those people that were able to go to the actual games that took place in Glendale. I think it's also worth noting, I think the mayor was quick to point out to me that the Jonas brothers actually liked one of the posts from the maincoms, and also the black keys reshared one of those posts as well. So when you see celebrities engaging with your content, I think that means you're doing something right now, I'd like to pass it over to our city major events administrator, Eric George, and he's going to do a deeper dive into the numbers. Thank you, Jerry. Thank you, mayor. Members of council, I wanted to talk a little bit about the attendance of the game. The games themselves, of course, were played out in Glendale at State Farm Stadium. And you can see on the screen here the robust attendance numbers that we saw, third highest in championship game history in terms of 74,000 plus fans at that game. And it's important to note that the second highest on that top three relist was in 2017, when it was right here in the Valley previously so over 2000 credentialed media members.

And it's important to note that the second highest on that top three relist was in 2017, when it was right here in the Valley previously so over 2000 credentialed media members. Another highlight to point out, speaking to that commercial that Jerry mentioned, is our opportunity to tell our story and get our valley out on a global platform. And, of course, 50 of 50 states represented, to see how many people are coming from outside the region, of course, to check out our destination for themselves. This slide shows kind of an overview of some of the events that were touched on. And then I'll dive into each of these a little bit deeper here in just a moment. But I think just collectively, it helps illustrate the number of people, the number of impacts that we were able to make on visitors and locals who attended these final four related events that were here in downtown, as well as out at the state stadium in Glendale with the tip off tailgate and the final four Friday events. So, let's talk about what was here in Phoenix. So, for four days at the Phoenix Convention center, we had the men's final four fan fest presented by Capital one. Over those four days, over 52,000 attendees walked through the doors to partake in different games and activations, get autographs from their favorite players, and basically partake in a sports wonderland that this little amusement park that was transformed in our convention center. And, of course, visit the team shop for all their souvenir needs, right? This was a low cost event and in fact, City of Phoenix saw broad attendance from all across our city. The March Madness Music Festival is a three day free event, totally free to attend for visitors and locals alike. It's a signature event for final four weekend. I think these pictures really tell a great story when you see the ones from the helicopter up above, the ones from the stage side and the aerial shots certainly show the magnitude of the event and how wonderful our park was transformed into this awesome event. Over the three days, 67,451 attendees visited Hance park to take in the March Madness Music Festival, headlining acts from Zed to the Jonas Brothers to Black Keys and Mumford and sons on Sunday. Great three days. A very exciting lineup and a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of fun was had by all. I think we've all seen the men's final four dribble presented by Buick, kind of everyone's favorite. Seeing the little ones dribble basketballs through downtown from Heritage Square two fan fest at the convention center. 3000 dribblers went through downtown, which means, of course, that with them were their parents and guardians and family members alike. So a very exciting Sunday morning. You can see the illustration there of all the basketballs waiting for the young ones to come pick them up. It was definitely a fun morning for everyone who participated in that event. I should note that there were some basketballs remaining at the end and they were able to donate those to our local parks and rec department to use at community centers across the city. In addition to the fan events, the National association of Basketball Coaches hosts their convention in the final four city each year. So we had nearly 4000 coaches who descended on our destination to take in clinics and meetings and different meetings with their colleagues from around the country. And a lot of these folks stayed in our downtown hotels or in light rail adjacent hotel properties were able to come into the downtown. So great opportunity to showcase our convention center and our downtown at large. To these convention goers from the NABC convention, I mentioned light rail just a moment ago. Light rail, as many of you probably are already aware, was sponsored and free for those individuals who are attending the final four events. Those sponsored rides were incredibly popular and light rail ridership increased 16% year over year for the four days of the final four events. Over 130,000 riders over the course of the weekend took advantage of light rail, including nearly 40,000 on Friday when downtown was abuzz with other activities as well, including the first Friday, a Sun's home game and so much more, including the March Madness Music Festival and the fan fest at the convention convention center that Sunday, light rail ridership saw a year over year increase of 41% when people were coming to those fan fest and music festival events. Bus ridership was up significantly as well as the route 70 that goes out to Glendale on Saturday for the semi final games saw a 40% increase in ridership going out towards Glendale. Great job by public transit team for sure, and airport coordination. The airport was definitely busy over at Sky harbor from the team arrivals as you see in some of the photos to the right there with the cheer teams from Alabama and the coaching staff from NC State coming into town.

Bus ridership was up significantly as well as the route 70 that goes out to Glendale on Saturday for the semi final games saw a 40% increase in ridership going out towards Glendale. Great job by public transit team for sure, and airport coordination. The airport was definitely busy over at Sky harbor from the team arrivals as you see in some of the photos to the right there with the cheer teams from Alabama and the coaching staff from NC State coming into town. But over the course of those four days, over 365,000 passengers were screened through TSA, which also nearly 175,000 bags were processed. Yet average TSA wait time remained only 6.4 minutes. Over 30,000 rental cars were checked out. The Skytrain was busy as it's ever been, 260,000 riders and charter operations of course were active as well, both at Sky Harbor, Deer Valley and Goodyear Airport. So we had to do some robust coordination to make sure that the community was aware of all these things that were happening in our city. And the Community and economic Development department did a great job leading this working group to help get the word out with eleven neighborhood and community meetings to various associations, two business permitting workshops to let small business owners know if they wanted to activate their businesses in a different or new way, that there was an opportunity to do that, and what kind of permits were necessary to make sure they were following our city rules, and two downtown stakeholder forums really just to get the information out to downtown businesses and residents alike so that they knew what was coming to our destination. Neighborhood notification postcards were delivered via mail to a 1 mile radius around both Hance park and Heritage Square. Nearly 6300 recipients received those postcards. There were over 200 email contacts that were reached out to directly and we also pounded the pavement a little bit. 65 businesses were visited on street level to make sure they were prepared and ready for the activity that would be coming. R1 point of pride over the course of the final four weekend was some of our green and sustainability initiatives. Public Works Department did a fantastic job by initially setting the goal of a zero waste event. A zero waste event is defined as having 90% of the waste diverted from the landfill. Proud to let you know that there was a 94.2% diversion rate for this event for all the activities at the convention center and the wire racks that were placed supplementally around the area. That means that over 51 tons of waste from these fan events were diverted from the landfill. So fantastic job for everyone involved with that initiative. Another great community initiative that the final four brings to town is the read to the final four. This is a literacy initiative for third graders. Over 15,000 Arizona students participated. The NCAA puts a focus on this third grader initiative because there's a direct correlation between successful outcomes at third grade proficiency level and then your success later in life in attending college. So obviously, the NCAA is a college support organization. They wanted to make sure that that is a focus of what they bring to town to make a lasting impact on our area. So, as I mentioned, over 15,000 Arizona students participated from 59 districts. 241 schools participated this time. Around 150 of those were title one schools at 62% that were on free reduced lunch programs. Over 20 million minutes were read by these students. Fantastic job. I have a ten year old home, and I admire their ability to reach these milestones. And one of the really cool things I saw Friday morning when this was announced to the final four teams in their bracket style competition that came down to the convention center and then went out to the stadium for final four Friday. They were informed that the band and cheer teams from Yukon and Purdue, who were participating in the championship, assembled bicycles to be donated to those top two schools. So that was a pretty cool announcement as well that the kids were pretty excited about. They didn't know about coming into that day. Next, I want to mention the men's final four legacy project presented by degree. This was a wonderful project. It was a collaboration between the Parks department, the NCAA degree deodorant, and the local organizing committee. East Lake Community center got a new indoor basketball court, new bleachers, wall pads, benches, scoreboard with a shot clock, adjustable hoops so children of all ages could participate. New backboards, new flooring in the weight room, and new weight equipment that you see on the upper left there. And the outdoor basketball court was refinished as well with new hoops, new backboards. And of course, kind of the crown jewel of this project really turned out to be the mural that was put on the outside. As you see, this mural was done to highlight a number of prominent members of the Eastlake community, including Councilman Goode, who's there front and center. I think that was definitely a point of pride for that community and all the members that came out to see that unveiling the week of Final Four. So, lastly, before we break for the day, I just wanted to kind of issue a thank you to all the different partners and different city departments that helped execute all the events that took place. The NCAA was a great partner, as well as the Phoenix Local organizing committee. Our partners like Valley Metro, Downtown Phoenix, Inc. And visit Phoenix, of course, for critical strategic partners in helping to execute all the things that we talked about today and the various successes that we saw over the course of the event.

So thank you everyone who's here and those who aren't. And then looking ahead, we're not quite done right. The men's final four economic impact study will be conducted by the local organizing committee in partnership with Arizona State, the host institution, and we'll have information about that in the coming months that we'll be able to report back to you on what that looks like. And then we'll be gearing up for some other major events in the coming months and years. This summer, in July of 2024, we have the WNBA all Star game coming to Phoenix. And then in 2026, the NCAA women's Final Four will come here to. Right here to downtown Phoenix. And then in 2027, we have the NBA All Star game. So a bit of a mecca of basketball over the next couple of years. But I know that we're all really excited for that challenge and looking forward to those events as well. At this time, we'd be happy to take any questions. Thank you. Wonderful. Thank you to all of Team Phoenix for delivering a great win for our region and our city. Appreciate the NCAA for partnering with us, and thank you to all our partners, including but not limited to the local organizing committee, Valley Metro, visit Phoenix, downtown Phoenix Inc. And more. It really was a great effort and we worked together to welcome the teams, put on great games and show off the best of our city, delivering for our third graders our parks programs and so much more. Also want to add that it was a privilege to host the HBCU all star game and highlight those great student athletes as well. And they even came by city hall. I could get used to cheerleaders in city hall. Kind of brings some good energy and a marching band. That was lovely. Councilmember, questions or comments? Councilwoman Hodge Washington I'll echo the mayor's comments. Thank you to everyone that made sure that we were able to present the best of Phoenix on our world stage. We provided a first class experience and we had a lot of wonderful press as a result. So thank you for everyone that was able to make that a possibility. I also wanted to highlight the Mariana Solar for me that in addition to two parks in my district, were able to benefit from having this project here in City of Phoenix. As we saw, Eastlake was one of the beneficiaries of the Legacy project, and as well as Grant park also was the Legacy project chosen by the HBCU all Star game. So two parks in my district were able to reap the benefits of that national press. So thank you. Many times we are focused on the economic benefits, but I also was very happy to see some of the community benefits, some of the longer lasting legacies that you're seeing as a result of the final four being held here in Phoenix. So thank you to everyone for all of your hard work in doing so, and let's do it again soon. Councilman O'Brien, I just have one question. Are you really going to let us take 2025 off? We do have an opening, so we need to fill it. And Ron Price is here, so we'll be working closely with Ron. I figured y'all were working on something for people watching online. Ron is up for it. Awesome. Well, thank you to everyone from public works to the folks at the hotels and restaurants and downtown businesses who really stepped up to put on a great show for us. With that, we are adjourned. Thank you. You must be bringing. Sheriff Penzone shared that the town of Guadalupe has had a significant crime increase since the Department of Justice has been in Maricopa County's business. They can't do anything about it because it would be considered a significant operation and they would need special approval to do that. Well, the committee you chair, public safety. We've been addressing the officer shortage we budgeted for.

We do have Officer Chester here to provide testimony. Would you like to hear that before? Yes, we should hear testimony first. Perfect. We will turn to officer Chester to provide us an update on this item, which is related to a dollar store. Good afternoon, mayor, members of the council, I am Kristin Lacaire Benavidez with city clerk. Also here today is Officer Samantha Chester with the Phoenix Police Department. This request is for a new series ten liquor license for a convenience store. This location was not previously licensed for liquor sales and does not have an interim permit. The 60 day limit for processing this application is May 11, 2024. Three letters protesting the issuance of this license have been received and are on file in the office of the city clerk. Staff recommends disapproval of this application based on a police department recommendation of disapproval and the neighborhood protest. Officer Chester again is here with me to provide a report for the police department. Thank you all for allowing me to be here today to speak on this matter. My recommendation of denial of Mister Chad Hawkins from obtaining a series ten liquor license at the Dollar General store located at 26 50 West Glendale Avenue, is based off of the following facts that I discovered throughout the course of my investigation after receiving the liquor application. These include errors and insufficient completion of Mister Hawkins State and city questionnaires, violence on the property, and code enforcement issues concerning statements made during the interview with the store manager of Dollar general, and sufficient liquor licenses in the area to meet the need and convenience of the community. Regarding the state questionnaire. After receiving the liquor application, I conducted a preliminary review and found contradicting errors between the state questionnaire and Mister Hawkins responses. When questioned on question number twelve, Mister Hawkins indicated he would be the controlling person who would be physically present and managing the day to day operation of the license premise. However, during my interview with Mister Hawkins, he indicated he would not be managing the day to day operations because he is responsible for many other dollar general stores in the area. He advised he's only required to visit the store every 45 days, but tries to come in every two weeks to meet with the store manager, Claire DeJesus. It should be noted Miss DeJesus was not listed as a manager for the liquor license, despite Mister Hawkins stating she was the manager in charge of the day to day operations. Furthermore, Mister Hawkins said if he was being honest, he did not fill out most of this application. Instead, his company filled it out for him and told him to apply for the liquor license. Regarding the city questionnaire, there were also errors on this on question number eight and question number nine in particular. Question number eight asks the applicant to list anyone having ownership interest in the business or in the profits of the business. Question number nine on the city questionnaire asks the applicant how much was paid for the business, including startup costs and the liquor license. Neither of these questions should ever be left blank. Every business has ownership or profit in a business and everyone must pay something, even if it's just fees. Mister Hawkins indicated not applicable as his responses to both questions. In regard to calls for service to the police department, a record check of the calls for service at this location was completed for a one year time span from the inception of the store on March 3 of 2023 to March 3 of 2024.

Neither of these questions should ever be left blank. Every business has ownership or profit in a business and everyone must pay something, even if it's just fees. Mister Hawkins indicated not applicable as his responses to both questions. In regard to calls for service to the police department, a record check of the calls for service at this location was completed for a one year time span from the inception of the store on March 3 of 2023 to March 3 of 2024. Within that timeframe, there have been 217 calls for service, 37 incident reports by police, and ten arrests made of these calls. Four of them are violent in nature, indicating an act of violence occurred on the property. Two examples of these are as follows. On January 20, 2024, an assault report was completed where the manager, mistahes, was assaulted. She asked an individual to leave the property, was then assaulted by him when he hit her and spit on her. On February 23 of 2024, a strong armed robbery occurred. An elderly gentleman in a wheelchair was approached by two individuals and was forcefully robbed of his personal items. Having a liquor license at this location will only exacerbate these above mentioned issues. In regards to code enforcement violations observed on April 4 of this year, I went to the store to meet with the store manager. Upon my arrival, there were debris and trash scattered throughout the property and the parking lot. After inquiring with neighborhood services department, I discovered Dollar general was previously cited for blight issues. In March of 2021, due to failure to control trash and graffiti. Due to the additional blight issues I observed, neighborhood services initiated and opened a new case on my behalf. These blight conditions encourage unhoused people to camp next to and at these locations. This is evidenced by the calls for service from March 3 of 23 to March 3 of 24. In this timeframe, 80 calls for service were placed for trespassing. In regards to my interview with the store manager, Claire DeJesus, after observing the blight conditions on the property, I went inside and met with her. She indicated she has been the manager there since the inception of the store. On March 3 of 23. She outright stated to me she does not want the store to start selling liquor because she would have more problems than she has now with theft and shoplifting. And according to the diagram provided in the liquor application from Dollar general, they indicated they would have alcohol right near the front door with no point of sale in between the front door and the alcohol. I asked her if they had security to help mitigate these issues and she said they did not. Furthermore, with regard to the staffing at the location, she said that they do have four managers and three sales associates on staff. But due to budgeting issues, Dollar general has directed her that they only want one employee working at a time. This can cause safety concerns for her and her staff. Some of her employees also told her they will quit if they get a liquor license due to the issues it will bring to the store. Furthermore, I asked Miss DeJesus how often she meets with Mister Hawkins since he is the one applying for this license. She said she had not seen him in 63 days. She further indicated he does not come into the store every 45 days, let alone every two weeks. And lastly, regarding other liquor licenses in the area, the public convenience and the best interest of the community would not be served by the issuance of this liquor license. Four other businesses near the dollar general currently hold liquor licenses. And that's the 711 gas station, Circle K, La Constanta. And ain't next. Due to the aforementioned factors, in accordance with Arizona revised statute 4203 a, the applicant is not capable, qualified or reliable to own and operate a liquor license within the city of Phoenix.

Do we have a motion? I move to approve second. Councilwoman O'Brien. Thank you so much, mayor. I just wanted to take a few moments to publicly thank the police Phoenix Police foundation for their continued commitment to supporting the needs of our community and for honoring our officers, whether it's in the form of the annual honor run or this donation to a police memorial for the new headquarters, as well as a wellness center for the well being of all of our officers. Most recently, they helped to fund the renovations to the new family advocacy center where victims of sexual assault will now be able to be in a warm and more comforting environment, as opposed to sitting feeling like they might be in a fishbowl. I'm so incredibly thankful to Tim Thomas for his continued leadership and stewardship over the Phoenix Police foundation, and I'm so grateful that they, they are supporting us and the police department.

Okay, thank you. Good afternoon, mayor and council. My name is Darrell Cripplin and I serve as the president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement association. I'm here to express our vehement opposition to continuing the contract with Steptoe and Johnson and specifically attorney Michael Bromwich. Michael was brought in to assist the city with the DOJ investigation as we continue to navigate this process. Steptoe was awarded additional money several months ago to extend the contract through June 30 of 2024.

Why would the city need to continue to retain Steptoe and Michael Bromwich for an additional $2 million, especially since Michael Bromwich and three other step two attorneys are being deputized as special assistant county attorneys by Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty in Minnesota to serve as the prosecution team in a trial of a Minnesota state trooper. That county attorney specifically said that these former federal prosecutors will be singularly focused on this case while the rest of her team continues critical work of prosecuting other serious cases. And the next scheduled hearing for that case is May 15. I question what benefit the city of Phoenix would have by continuing this contract with Steptoe and Johnson and specifically Michael Bromwich. This is fiscally irresponsible. And that money should, should be reallocated to help offset the huge loss of state tax revenue. And the city is going, if the city is going to experience in the near, in the foreseeable future. I appreciate your time. Thank you. Thank you. Ann Ender is next. Okay. And Ann has signaled that support for the previous testimony. Perfect. So for those who could not hear, Ann Ender agrees with the previous testimony and adds support for it. Comments Councilman Waring. Thank you, mayor. I appreciate it. So I'm going to vote against this item. I was well pleased with what we did with item 80. I've known one of those attorneys for many years, and I think they'll do an excellent job. I do see, frankly, unlike Darrell, I do see the need for maybe a second set of eyes. I just don't want it to be this set of eyes. I won't belabor it. You guys have heard my thoughts in the past about this particular subject. I just simply cannot find it in me to support the tenure of this particular law firm. With us anymore. I do think we had other alternatives, and I thought we should have selected one of those alternatives. We didn't, but I do understand the continuity issue. But I think the Denton team would have done a fine job simply on their own, supported by maybe a couple other local attorneys. So I'm disappointed in the outcome of this. However, I do have a lot of confidence in the folks we selected with item 80. So thank you, mayor. I appreciate it. Thank you. Any additional comments? Councilwoman Hunt, Washington. Thank you, mayor. Can I ask a couple of questions of our staff, please? I would like to hear from our city attorney whether or not we think the retention in the out of state case peruses a conflict of interest for the city. Mayor, members of council. Council member Hodge, Washington. So as you're well aware, attorneys are bound by rules of ethics, and in this case, under those rules, I do not see that their representation is a violation of any rules of ethics, which would be perceived as a conflict of interest under the rules. In the event that, is there anything in our contract with the offices of Steptoe and Johnson that prohibits us from terminating that relationship should a conflict arise, may our members of council, council member Hodge, Washington know if, first of all, they would need to request a waiver if there was a specific conflict that arises and that is outlined in the contract? Furthermore, we always have discretion to review the contract and to review their scope of representation with the city. Thank you so much, Councilman O'Brien. Thank you. Thank you, Julie. If they're being deputized in just a couple of weeks and will, I would imagine, be quite busy with this trial if for some reason they're unavailable, is that we could discontinue the contract for those reasons. Mayor, members of council. Council member O'Brien. So if, if they were unavailable to represent the city at a time where we needed them, then certainly we could carry on further conversations with them about their scope of representation, and if needed, we could terminate the contract. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Roll call. Galindo, Elvira Guardado. Yes. Hodge, Washington. I want to explain my vote. Mayor, do I'm going to support the motion because we still have the ability, if necessary, if a conflict does truly arise, to terminate the contract under those circumstances. I believe at this juncture, it is presumptuous of us to presume that this trial may move forward. We know many times cases are resolved before an actual, actual trial, and we, at this juncture, I just think that to, I respect the opinions and testimony that we've heard so far on the issue but I think we are kind of putting the cart before the horse. No conflict of interest has actually arisen in this case, and we still retain the ability to terminate should one occur. So I'm going to support the motion. Thank you, Mayor O'Brien. Mayor, may I explain my vote? Please do.

I am going to support the motion as well because I think that it is important for us to have the step toe with us, given that they have been with us since the beginning. This has been going on for two and a half years, and they've been with us every step of the way. I would prefer them to be a part of our team when we get our findings. So for that reason, I will be voting yes. Robinson all right, mayor, may I explain my vote? As for pretty much the same reasons we've heard from some of my colleagues, I understand the importance of that continuity with Steptoe, but I'm going to be voting no. I just don't think this is the right thing to do. Continue with them under a variety of circumstances going, you know, there's several things it's not appropriate for me to mention here, but my answer has to be no on this one. Waring I think you just briefly explained my vote. They were our lead attorneys, and we chose to go a different direction. I think that speaks to how we feel things maybe have been going. So going forward, I am pleased that we're going to have new leadership on our legal team, and I look forward to working on that. Stark yes. Gallego? Yes. Passes six two. All right, we now go to the planning and zoning portion of our agenda. Items 109 and 110 are related items, both at the southwest corner of 52nd street in McDowell. We will have one public hearing, but two individual votes. This is in district six. Councilman Robinson, do we need a staff report before the public hearing? Mayor, I don't believe a staff report is necessary now. Great. Open the public hearing. And 109 and 110. We do not have any members of the public to testify. So close the public hearing. Councilman 1st 109. Thank you, mayor. I make a motion to approve per the Planning commission recommendation and adopt the related resolution. Second, we have a motion and a second. Any comments? Roll call. Galindo. Yes. Guardado. Yes Hodge. Washington. Yes. O'Brien. Yes. Robinson. Yes. Waring? Stark. Yes. Gallego. Yes, passes 70. All right, 110. Councilman Robinson, thank you, mayor. Motion to approve per the planning Commission recommendation and adopt the related ordinance. Second, we have a motion and a second comments. Roll call. Galinde? Elvira. Yes. Guardado. Yes. Hodge. Washington. Yes. O'Brien yes. Robinson. Yes. Waring. Stark. Yes. Gallego. Yes, passes 70. All right. It's been a very exciting meeting, and we move forward on that, as well as some historic preservation investments, some affordable housing grants and more. Now we go to item 50. Do we have a motion? We need to read the title. Thank you. Item 50 is for ordinance g 7258, an ordinance relating to the Office of Accountability and transparency, amending chapter 20, article one, section 21 of the Phoenix City Code, article two, sections 25 through 2010 and 2013, and repealing and deleting sections 2011 in its entirety, adding article three, sections 2014 through 2017 and amending article four, section 2026. Thank you. Now, do we have a motion? Mayor? Thank you. I move to approve second. Wonderful. We have a motion and a second, and we do not have any public comment on this item. Okay. Council member comments? Mayor? Councilman O'Brien, I have a friendly amendment to section 2014, a one the section regarding all voting members that it would instead read, all voting members shall either reside or work in the city of Phoenix. Members must be at least 21 years of age. No current or former sworn law enforcement officer or individual who has filed a claim or lawsuit related to actions by the City of Phoenix Police Department is eligible to serve as a voting member of the board with the motioner. And, second, be willing to take that as a friendly amendment. Mary? Yes, I would be willing to accept this. And, mayor, I'm fine as well. And if I could explain, please do. Thank you. So I think that it's incredibly important that we continue to take steps forward to monitor and make our police department better. We know, we're all aware that this DOJ, we're in the middle of the DOJ investigation, an investigation which, as I said earlier, has been going on for two and a half years. We still do not have an indication yet of when they may close their investigation and provide us with their findings. However, as we have done before and as we continue to do, Phoenix is not waiting for the DOJ to finish their investigation to make reforms. Already, we've added body worn cameras to all of our officers, which is not something every law enforcement agency has in this country. We've invested in the community assistance program so that mental health professionals are able to respond to emergency calls related to mental health needs. We've created the Office of Accountability and Transparency to work with our police department to review policies and provide suggested changes with an outsider's perspective. The police department reformed our use of force policies and implemented new trainings across the department.

The vote today is yet another example of the city of Phoenix being proactive in self policing and another prime example to the Department of Justice that we do not need a costly consent decree and monitor to reform our police department. However, this particular part excludes all folks who have previous law enforcement experience, whether they are not a current law enforcement. I think that there is also a concern to provide balance to this, that we will exclude folks who might use this position to receive additional information on a claim or lawsuit or who already have a personal agenda on the other side of the spectrum. Thank you, mayor. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Waring. Thank you, mayor. I voted against the original oat. Two of the things that concerned me were it's sort of overview and conducting investigations of the police department, but the state legislature took away that power. My concern now with Oat is primarily that we're paying the same bill I think we were originally tabbed with, which I think is three and a half million dollars a year, Jeff, unless you're going to correct it. But most of the time intensive tasks that they would have been charged with, they no longer do. It would be as if the fire department no longer went on emergency calls and only fought fires, but we kept paying the same bill. That doesn't make a lot of sense. But, you know, I've said my piece, and apparently we're going to keep doing it so that we're paying $3.5 million for a lot less than was originally anticipated by those of you who were supportive. But in this case, with the civilian review board, I do understand. I think it was, Councilman O'Brien said, you know, we're in the middle of Department of Justice investigation. I don't know if this would help mitigate their feelings about it at all. I suppose it wouldn't. But the oat organization as a whole has been so neutered that I don't think it's going to be able to do any damage to the police department's effectiveness either. And a lot of other cities do have it. So I was undecided when I woke up this morning. I think I'm going to support it. Probably if the legislature hadn't done what they had done, it might be a different story. But I will be supportive. Thank you, mayor, for the time. Thank you, council. Vice. Mayor and then council one, Guardado. Thank you, mayor. I, too, am going to be supportive of this. I'm proud of our police department. I think they do good work, but we can always stand improvement. It doesn't matter what profession you are, we can always do with some improvement. And I also think this is a tool that we can use in a positive way. And in regards to Department of Justice, I think we have stepped up and we're trying to address some of the issues that they're reviewing, and I think this is an important step. I also want to thank Councilman Robinson. I've had a chance to talk to him and I value him. He's a former police officer and he has really schooled me in the value of a citizen review board. And I thank you for your advice on this, and I think it's a good step. I think it's balanced. I appreciate your amendment, Councilwoman O'Brien, and with that, I'll be happy to vote yes. Thank you, Councilwoman Guardado. Thank you, mayor. So just a couple comments. First, I just want to thank our city manager, Jeff, Lori, Ginger, all of you guys that have been working on this around the clock for the last couple of years. Thank you guys for all of your hard work and working with all of us. This has been an ongoing process for almost for a little bit over four years. I want to say, and I just want to say that the formation of the Office of Accountability and Transparency was and always has been driven by our unwavering commitment to fostering a strong bond between the police of Phoenix and our people of Phoenix and our police department. It is imperative that police force and believes that they are being treated fairly with dignity and respect. The Office of Accountability and Transparency is designed to provide a direct channel for community, community feedback and concerns. OAt serves as a testament to our belief that open communication, transparency and accountability are the cornerstones of building trust and understanding within our community. While oat might not be everything we hoped it would be in the beginning of this process because of actions of the state legislature, by providing an additional avenue for dialogue, we aim to demonstrate, demonstrate that the police department's dedication to serving the community with the highest level of integrity and professionalism. We owe this to our police department, to our police officers, to have another tool that we can use to bring community and police together and to be able to give that voice to our community that needs to be heard. And I want to thank, once again, everyone for all of their hard work, for everything that everyone has done to get us to this moment. And I will be voting yes.

And I want to thank, once again, everyone for all of their hard work, for everything that everyone has done to get us to this moment. And I will be voting yes. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Hodgewashington. Thank you, Mayor, for the opportunity I was in faith. I am actually torn, and I wanted to speak a little bit to my colleague about my concerns about the amendment. I think this is more than a friendly amendment. I think this is a fundamental, a significant change on who, who can serve on the civilian review board and for us to do it at this juncture without community feedback. I am a little concerned about that. I am also concerned that one of the criticism that I have heard regarding the civilian review board is that we are taking it away from certain members of the community. And I think those that have had an experience or filed a claim with PD, right or wrong, should not just be summarily dismissed. They have. They bring a unique perspective. And if the goal of the civilian review board is to see how we can make more positive change towards our community, I don't think we should necessarily just outright dismiss those individuals. I get it that we're in the middle of a DOJ investigation and we want to ensure that this is not being used for personal agenda. However, there are other ways. I believe that we can make those safeguards to ensure that the information is protected versus summarily just dismissing individuals from being able to serve on this board. We have adequate safeguards. I believe in the actual ordinance as written. For example, the members of the board have to be approved by two thirds of this council. I think that is one way in which we do that. I do not believe that it is appropriate to just summarily say that because you file filed a claim and it doesn't articulate what level of claim that could be. What if that person has a claim against the police department because of an auto accident? That person possibly could not serve on the civilian review board. I understand what we're trying to do here, but I think the language as proposed, I have some qualms with it. So I would either revote no or have another suggestion on how we move forward. And one of the suggestions, I think, is ensuring that all members of the board have equal access to information. If they believe additional supplemental information is necessary. It could be subject to the same as section 20, hyphen 15, subsection D, which would require all five voting members to vote in favor of any item requiring action, including any request for supplemental information. That way, we ensure that all members, members of the civilian review board have the same information and we make sure that it is a united, it is a majority decision on what information is required. So I just wanted to put that on the record and ask that my colleagues consider some of the comments that I have raised regarding this issue. It is not to say I disagree in entirety. I just think that there are other ways to do this. But we want to make sure that the civilian review board, it serves its purpose. And I think ignoring or omitting those individuals that have had an experience with our police department are not necessarily summarily dismissed. I've had, as part of the community, I'm sorry, the Department of Justice, town halls. I have met individuals who have had experience with our law enforcement, and not all members, not all individuals are what I believe this is trying to stop what they believe to be bitter in individuals, or there are some people who are just vested in actually making this a better experience, and I think we don't want to summarily dismiss those experiences. Thank you, mayor, for allowing me to voice my concerns. Thank you. Before we go on to more general comments, does anyone want to react to Councilman Hutch Washington's comment? And I'm sorry, with Councilman Guardado? Thank you, mayor. I agree with the councilwoman. I do believe that, you know, this version is already very watered down. And as much as I want to support this and as much as I want to be part of making this happen, this has been in the works for over four years, I just think that it's also very sudden to bring this language in for, you know, many of us haven't had a chance to really process this. So I'm not sure if we are willing to change this language around just to address some of these concerns. Thank you. Any additional comments, mayor? Councilwoman pastor. This is councilwoman pastor. I'm not actually, I entered when Councilwoman Hodge Washington was speaking at the very beginning. I don't know what has been proposed, so I can wait till the end where I can hear everybody and then make comments. Wonderful. Why don't we pause for a second and perhaps could the city clerk share the proposal? Yes, mayor. The current motion on the floor is for item 50 to be approved with an amendment to section 2014, a one stating all voting members shall either reside or work in the city of Phoenix.

No current or former sworn law enforcement officers or an individual who has filed a claim or lawsuit related to actions by the city of Phoenix Police Department is eligible to serve as a voting member of the board. And we currently have a motion and a second. And that was a friendly amendment introduced by Councilwoman O'Brien, which was accepted by both the maker of the motion and the second. Thank you. I'm going to hold my comments until I can get onto Webex. Thank you. Wonderful. Thank you, mayor. Councilman Guardado. Thank you. Can we just get a few examples of who then would not be able to be part of this board just so that it could just put it in context for everyone and for Councilwoman, pastor, mayor and members of council? I think we would have to do, we would have to look to see if the item is that no person or, you know, that has been a party to a lawsuit or a claim against, made against, that had an action against the Phoenix police, we would have to do a search so we can give concrete examples. Then I, without doing that search, I don't know of particularly what names the council had in mind. Then I would recommend that we don't accept these changes just because we're about to vote on a big item, and either we continue the item so we can get briefed on what this means for folks that will be part of the board or remove the language. That would be my recommendation. Councilwoman O'Brien. Councilwoman Guerdo, are you looking for names or examples? I'm talking about. Yes, examples of people. I mean, and I want to hear it from the attorney. Right. Examples given the language, examples of who could not be part of this. I apologize, mayor, members of council. So, councilmember, to answer your question, this would be any named individual. So, for instance, if someone was shot by police, if that person had survived, or if their family members made a claim against the city related to actions by Phoenix police, that might be an example of persons who would not be eligible under this provision. It's just for folks dealing with issues with the police department. Or is it issues citywide? No, my understanding is it's just related to actions involving the Phoenix Police Department. So that might also be a use of force. If somebody had a claim in an arrest, they had an injury during that arrest, and they made a claim or a lawsuit against the city, then that person would not be able to be on the board. Okay. So issues just with the police department, correct? Not any other department? Correct. Councilwoman HUD Washington. Thank you. I just want to follow up on councilman, Councilman Garda's question, because as written, it says, who has filed a claim or a lawsuit related to actions by the city of Phoenix Police Department? And I gave the example of a car accident. What happens if this person, because the way I read this, tell me if I'm wrong. If there was a vehicle, a vehicle accident involving a police officer, and under our, the way that cases are pled, you normally name the husband and the wife in this, and one of those members of the, of the marriage decided they wanted to apply for this. They've, they've technically filed a claim or lawsuit related to action from the police, police officer by the police department. Under this revision or amendment, this person would not be able to serve. Am I correct, mayor? Members of council. Council member Hodge, Washington I would interpret it that way. Thank you. And my understanding of the intent of this amendment, what it seems twofold. And Councilwoman O'Brien can clarify, it is more so to prohibit what is what I would consider a fishing expedition or a search for additional information to support their potential claims against the city of Phoenix police Department. And two, if this person may have a negative personal agenda that goes derogatory towards the police department, are those the intent of the amendment? That would be correct. And I continue to advocate that there are additional ways for us in which we can do that without necessarily creating an entire universe of individuals that cannot serve on the civilian review board. Councilwoman O'Brien, sorry, you can go ahead. So, and I understand and appreciate Councilwoman Hodge Washington's alternative. However, right or wrong, we have also excluded an entire group of civilians who have law enforcement background. So once a law officer leaves the police department, like our colleague councilman Robinson, after a certain amount of time, he is no longer a law enforcement person. He is a civilian. However, we have excluded all of those people as well from serving on the civilian review board. So what, in addition to those items that Councilwoman Hodge Washington said, I am looking to, I'm looking to provide balance on our civilian review board by having no group on the fringes available to be on the council, the civilian review board. And if I could respond to that comment, that's why I led with my initial comment where I said, this is more, in my opinion, than a friendly amendment.

Versus, we're adding now expanding the universe of individuals that are unable to serve. And that's where my concerns come from, is that we don't, we, I don't, I think this is more than a friendly amendment. It is a material change, in my opinion, on who can serve. And I think the community should be given the opportunity to chime in before we, as council members make a determination on this. Thank you, Councilman Robinson. Mayor thank you. You know, I appreciate the conversation that's taking place right now, and I understand where everybody is coming from, but what I would like to do is offer up. What I think is what's most important here. What's most important is that we are able to seat a civilian review board, excuse me, that is accepted, not wholly, not completely, by both sides. And the best way for us to do that is by not having the perception that someone sitting on the board is going to lean one way or another prior to understanding the facts. And I understand Councilwoman O'Brien said it, I think, very well with regard to a former police officer. I've been gone for over eight years. Things have changed. Could I sit back and render an opinion that is fair and unbiased? I believe I could, but that perception by a lot of people would be that, no, there's no way possible that I would be able, that would be possible on my part. So I get it. I get where everybody is coming from, but I think what's on the floor right now in the friendly amendment is the right direction to go. It provides us with a mechanism that would be in place that I believe where both sides, not everybody, is happy. And I think that tells us something that tells us that it's not leaning one way or another. And I think that should be the goal, is for us to seat individuals who are going to be right in the middle, and when they hear the information, they'll make a decision based on that. So, mayor, thank you very much for the time. Thank you. Is there a way to tailor the language a little bit? Because I think it's not meant to be someone who was trying to get a police report for a car accident. Yes. Councilman Hodge, Washington. Thank you, mayor. I just kind of did this on the fly. So it may not be the fully vetted, but one of my suggestions in ensuring that, one, we want to make sure that all members of it, like I mentioned, of the civilian review board, would have access to the same level of information and that all members of the civilian review board have a say in what is actually, if any, supplemental information is requested. My suggestion or my proposal would be to section 20, hyphen 15, subsection d, and it would read, five voting members of the board shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of conducting business, and five voting members must vote in favor of any item requiring action, comma, including any request for supplemental information so that prohibits one person from going rogue and receiving information specific to their case. You now would have five members of the civilian review board saying, this information is what we all want to see in order to make a determination, and if that's what we're trying to prevent is that someone on the civilian review board would use as a fishing expedition. They now have to explain to their colleagues on this board. Why this information is important. And then get their. Then get their consent to request that information. So, like I said, I was trying to acknowledge what the intent was of the provision. I'm sorry. Of the amendment from my colleague. And that was my. That's what I think would serve the purpose. Without necessarily changing the impact act of. I'm sorry. Without changing the. Significantly changing the contents and the composition of the civilian review board. Council Warner Bryant. It does part of it. It does not take away the factor of you having somebody who could have an agenda or a perceived agenda, which is by keeping somebody not on the civilian review board. I don't have a problem. I understand what this does achieve, and I don't. I do like this language because I think it is important for the board to have that kind of checks and balance as well. But it does not preclude somebody, as Councilman Robinson was saying, from being on there. That could be perceived as having a negative agenda on the other side of this scale or spectrum. But we already have. My response to that would be that we already have mechanisms in place under the draft ordinance that would address that to ensure that we don't. In order for anyone to serve on the civilian review board, two thirds of this city council has to approve it. And I'm thinking if there is that negative perception, there will not be two thirds vote from this council.

And I'm thinking if there is that negative perception, there will not be two thirds vote from this council. And I think what we are doing here is exactly what we don't want individuals to do when it comes to our police department. We don't want people to presume that our police department is biased towards itself. But yet we are presuming that anyone who has ever filed a claim against the police department. Could not serve in a neutral manner on the civilian review board. I just don't believe that we should automatically remove somebody who has valuable experience in dealing with these types of. In this situation from the conversation. And I also think it goes back to, for me now we are adding an entire group of people. Who cannot serve on the civilian review board just outright, without any consideration as to who that person is and what kind of influence or impact they could make. I had the pleasure of, as part of one of my roundtables I did with Chief Sullivan, a mena individual who has had a negative experience with the. With our police department. And he is wanting to figure is he is, he got up there and he said he doesn't have any ill will against the police department. He just wants to see how he can work to make it better. And under the scenario that we are presenting, this individual could never serve on the civilian review board. So I feel strongly about this, and that's why I chose to articulate my position on this. I get where you're coming from. I respect that wholeheartedly, but I feel it and within my conscience that I have to explain what it is that we are, what that language has the net effect of doing. So, thank you, mayor. Thank you. We'll go to councilman Waring and then councilwoman pastor. Thank you. So if this was considered a jury and a prosecutor was doing jury selection like they do in John Grisham novels and so forth, and they found out the person who's a potential juror is suing the police department that arrested the perpetrator, in my fictional example, there's no way they'd be like, oh, yeah, that sounds fine. They're gonna be unbiased, biased. There's no way. So we're acting like with 1.7 million or 1.6 million or whatever it is, Phoenicians, we're going to run out because we won't be able to find somebody who's not suing the police department. So we better make sure everybody's eligible. You know what? If people are that determined to serve on a board or commission, we can find something else for them to do. They don't necessarily have to serve on this. I just think at some point that's this is not. This is well written, and I don't think it's an unreasonable ask, particularly since we're excluding other people that we're saying would be, by definition, be biased, which I don't think is necessarily fair to them either. So I'm definitely supportive of the amendment and would reevaluate my support for all of this if it was taken away. Of course, part of my support is predicated on Ed. It doesn't really do anything. I think oat has spent millions, and I think they put out one, maybe two reports. I'm trying to think, and I'll think hard about this. What has changed because of those reports? Anything? Those are expensive reports. I know we all have to pay a lot for copies when you go in for public records or whatever, but they're not that expensive. So I guess ultimately, I don't know that anything's going to change because we got a civilian review board. I think we're going to have plenty of people applying who aren't suing the police department that could be selected. And I don't expect this to change a whole lot, given how much we're spending for it ultimately in the long run, regardless, because of the state legislature's action. Thank you, mayor. Thank you. I will go to Councilman pastor, and then I have a comment. Yes, this question is for Julie. Julie, can you give me examples of people who have filed against PD? I don't need names. I want to know examples of those that would not qualify or be able to apply for oat. Mayor, members of council. So again, I think examples would be those that have made claims or sued if they are involved in an auto accident, if there's been use of force or which may or may not include a shooting. And in that case, also, sometimes then family members might make a claim or against that would be against the police department. Okay. And I have a bigger question, and I'll get into it. We had protesting going on, and this is why DOJ is here. And protesting went on, and the police department decided to file gang charges on them. And they're probably in the middle of a class action right now, and they have had experience with the police and the dynamics and would have a valid voice. Would they be precluded from this? Mayor, members of council? Council member Pastor yes. We also have some lawsuits that do involve Amendment first, you know, violation of first rights, First Amendment. Sorry. That those may also be precluded. Okay. Well, I was part of one of the original council people that felt very strongly that there needed to be an office, accountability and transparency.

And there was a lot of work that went into us and there was very, very hard work. Tours tore up pieces. And there was a reason why law enforcement was not involved sitting on this board. And it was because of PSB, because they would be able to have the opportunity to, on our city side, be able to go through that process. And they have a whole office. They have a whole piece that goes along. And the Office of Accountability and Transparency was really a community voice coming up and wanting to say, we want to have a neutral space to be able to file or to be able to look at cases that we felt were not necessarily were not in line with policy. And so I find this, I actually find it insulting to me of those that worked on this to have a conversation as to saying, okay, what was the background and why was this not part of it? I understanding those wanting to advocate for law enforcement, to sit on there and any, as much as we want to claim we wouldn't have bias in the in our career, there is bias. We're human, and everything is subjective. So I'm not in line with the friendly amendment, and I just think I'm just kind of taken back. Thank you. Thank you. To me, Oat has done very important work. They issued just four reports just last week. It has been analysis that has helped me, and the department has made changes in response to the reports. I have found it thoughtful and have gathered. It's an opportunity to gather best practices from across the country. There's not one tool that solves public safety problems. We need multiple tools in the toolbox. Oat is important, the civilian review board is important, but none of it is sufficient, and we have to keep working towards best practices. So I appreciate the work that Oat is doing. The model that OaT is based on is often called a review model, where civilians look at and review the actions of the police department, as I understand it, is the most popular model across the country. It is not our first choice, but it is still very valuable in doing important work. Trying to understand. It seems that all council members have really valid points here, and I'm trying to see what is a good path forward. One possibility is there are areas that oat has mandatory oversight on, such as in custody deaths. It does not have mandatory oversight over car accidents. So is there a way that folks who have active litigation over areas where it has mandatory oversight would not be on the board? So we might exclude people involved in active litigation, but then folks who have been involved in criminal, in car accidents could be on there. So it would maybe a melding of Councilwoman O'Brien and Councilman Hodge Washington's, where we would not have individuals who are involved in areas that oat has mandatory oversight on. And can you. So, page 422, section 26. Mayor, would you like me to read that section? I think that would be very valuable. So, mayor, members of council, the OaT has mandatory review over any shooting involving uniformed personnel, whether duty related or not, any in custody death or any duty related incident during which, or as a result of which anyone dies or suffers serious bodily injury, as that term is defined in ars 13 100 539, as it may be amended from time to time. Can I respond to your suggestion, mayor? Please. Councilwoman, I think trying to, at this juncture, modify the language still for me offends one of the, my principles, that we are excluding a group that with an opportunity, without presenting an opportunity to the community. With all due respect to Councilman O'Brien, it is. I do not believe it's a friendly amendment and I would prefer that it would be stricken from it, its entirety. I think the fact that we had zero public comments about this item and todays meeting, which is a little surprising to me, means, at a minimum, the community has reviewed this and finds it passable. And for us now to then change our course in a significant manner, I still continue to have trouble with it. So I honestly wouldn't want my revision or what I propose to be presented because the public hasn't had an opportunity to chime in on it. I think it, I think we don't want to engage in any conduct that would undermine the public's confidence in this board and what it lies. I mean, it has been an issue for some time. It has been an area where I believe that we have to get it right. And I think by getting it right means also when we present something to them, we don't come on the last minute and change and say who is available to serve and what that looks like. I think if we. My preference would be for us to vote up and down as presented, and then if, if we have any subsequent revisions later on, we ask staff to make that proposal based on the considerations and we come back with it. That would be my preference. But I'm just one member on this council, and that would be how I would prefer to proceed. Mayor. Councilman O'Brien. I'm open to that change to limit the folks there.

Thank you. Mayor. Could I add one more thing? I apologize. Yes. Councilman O'Brien. And then we'll go to Council Gordon. And my community did provide feedback, and they find the fact that we cannot have not law enforcement, because I do not believe law enforcement folks belong on a civilian review board, but have people who had previously been law enforcement, they find that unacceptable part of this. So this is a way to compromise and move this forward. And I do think it's important that we do that. Councilman Guardado. Thank you, mayor. Given the conversation that we're having, I would like to make a secondary motion to strike the friendly amendment. So you would move up. Okay. So I would remove whatever. Okay. We would be a new. It would be a motion to approve as introduced. Is that what it be? No. Correct. Mayor. Members of council. So you're making a substitute motion to approve the ordinance as written without changes. Right. All right. And I would second that. Okay. So just refresher for folks who don't come to every council meeting, we will first vote on Councilwoman Guardado's motion, and then we would vote. If that passes, that carries. If it does not pass, we would then vote on Councilman Robinson's motion. All right, mayor? Councilman Pastor yes, I have some questions to staff. The questions are, is that necessarily, we were told the reason why we were cleaning up out was because we wanted to be in compliance with state law. Am I correct? Mayor members of council so, councilmember pastor one of the reasons that we were making changes to the existing sections in chapter 20 were to come into compliance with state law. Yes, but my question now is there's a lot of ordinances that we have that state law has passed and are not in compliances and are still on our books. So I guess my question to you, Julie, is who asked you to change this? Mayor members of council so we, because we were coming back with changes to chapter 20 to add the civilian review board, we also proposed making those changes since it was coming back to comply with state law. Okay, let me get even further down to the question, since you're not answering it. Who did you work with on council to change these amendments and change this ordinance? Mayor members of council I did not work with any specific council member to make the changes to sections 21 through 2013. Okay, who did you work with on all of the ordinance? Who did you get advisement from on the board? On the council? Mayor members of council so one of the council offices had worked on the board language, but all of the changes to section 20 2013 came, you know, from the law department and then from review after the policy meeting. But the new language, we had worked with all the council offices on those language, and we put through an ordinance review with the law department to make sure that the language was consistent with other sections of the code. I guess where I'm going at is the whole intent of oat was also to bring trust to the community and that the community wanted an avenue of a place where they could file any complaint or even police. Police can file a complaint because the intent to vote was also to protect the police and have these, these processes into play in order to also protect the police and be able to get a second eyes or second look on it on oat. I am struggling with this and what is happening to oat and not understanding how this came about. I understand when we were setting up our board, but I definitely know, and I will not publicly say, but I definitely know staff worked with members from the specifically worked with members to change some of this language, and that is fine, but I feel like the whole, I think there needs to be a bigger conversation as to who's going to, in changing that friendly amendment. So thank you. Thank you, Vice mayor. Thank you. You know, I understand the concern councilwoman O'Brien has is that we right now say no current or former sworn law officer is eligible to serve as a voting member. And I know there's a concern that in the state of Arizona, I'm sure a lot of the different police departments know others that serve on one or another department. And so I get that concern. But, I mean, if we want to be fair and we say, take out the individual who's filed a claim, why can't we have some kind of law enforcement and perhaps have no current or former sworn law enforcement who served in the state of Arizona? My neighbor is a former New York City police officer and he's been retired for many a year, but he doesn't really know anyone in Arizona. But I'm trying to find a way because I think we need to move forward. We need to get something done. But I want to be sensitive that we really are trying to represent the entire city. And, I mean, by excluding all law enforcement, you're excluding a lot of the public, who does support law enforcement. So maybe there's some way we could compromise there. I don't know.

I know what to do because I came prepared to vote on the resolution or on the ordinance before us because that's what I've talked to residents and constituents about. And to make a change on it means that I didn't share it with them. And it makes me feel like I didn't do my job well, and I want to do my job well and I want to represent the people that I represent well.

You know, police officers and police departments get their strength, get their power, get their authority from the public, and it's never going to be, as I stated earlier, it's never going to be a complete acceptance by everybody. I think the information has been put forward. I believe very strongly that the motion that has been made, and I'm comfortable with the friendly amendment is the right direction to go. I've lived in this community since 1974. I was with the Phoenix Police Department since December of 1980. I've worked throughout this entire community on all kinds of issues. And I think it's important as we move forward, and that was mentioned by several folks, that we do need to move forward. I think it's important for us to have a body in this review board that has, what I think, the credibility it has, the perception of being unbiased. And I think we get there, I truly believe we get there by not having folks from one extreme or the other extreme, somebody who is completely and totally in favor of and in love with the police and somebody who is not completely and totally in hate with the police. I think when you have those, for lack of a better word, when you have those extremes, you're not going to get anywhere. I think we need to move forward. I think we need to, for all the right reasons, have this review board in place. Phoenix has always been at the cutting edge of citizen community involvement. Civilians have sat, citizens, civilians, residents have sat on the use of force and disciplinary review boards since 1983. It's been expanded. We have, as an organization and as a city, the law enforcement, the police department and the city have always listened to the public when things have happened and always responded. I see us getting there by moving forward with this civilian review board, and I think the information that has been provided, friendly amendment. I get it. I understand, because what it does, it makes sure that one side isn't, you know, the scales aren't tilted in one way or another. So, mayor, with the experience that I have and the research that has been done, I just think this is a good way to move us forward for a board that does not have investigative abilities, it's a review and recommend, and I think we're able to do that. I think there are some folks who, regardless of how we look at it, are going to feel one way or another. And if we can take that element out of the process, I think we're better off for it. So I go back to the original recommendation, the original motion, and I thank you for your time, mayor. Thank you. Councilman Hodgewashington. I guess I just wanted to say a couple things. I'm not saying here. I don't want the civilian review board to move forward, but I want us to also remember this is called the civilian Review Board. So there are other boards where we're required to have a certain number of law enforcement officials. So we're not, what I'm saying is not meant to be anti law enforcement. What I'm saying is let's keep one. Again, this was not shared with the community, and we are now excluding a group of people who we weren't excluding before. I am concerned with the timing of this. When you talk about being one sided, I think we run the same risk of our credibility being questioned if we start making the civilian review board a place where we are appointed, or we're saying that if you've ever had a claim against law enforcement, you could never serve on here. And that's not, unfortunately, that may be some civilian's experience, and that's an experience that we should not just summarily dismiss because we are presuming that this person won't be biased. I mean, it's no different than saying anyone that has ever been a police officer will always side with law enforcement. And I have heard my colleagues and other members from the police department say that police officers are the ones that judge themselves the hardest. Right. So why are we making the same assumption against somebody who has had a claim? Why are we not using that as an opportunity to learn from that person who's had a claim against the city and determine how we can become better?

So why are we making the same assumption against somebody who has had a claim? Why are we not using that as an opportunity to learn from that person who's had a claim against the city and determine how we can become better? That's where my objection comes from. And I think that if this was such an important issue, it should have been briefed and circulated with all of us prior to today on the dais. We should have all had some feedback in that and had some conversation. I respectfully, I understand the motive, but I continue to believe it is not a friendly amendment. It is a material change to our ordinance as presented. And I don't think it is to make that on the cusp at this juncture for something that is so important. The civilian review board has been a flashpoint for this city for some time as to why we need it, and I think we should make sure we do it the right way. So I will now let you speak. Mayor. Wonderful. Thank you. Throughout the time we have debated these issues, one of the things that a majority of the council has said is that we want this board to be fair. We want people who can look at what is at the best of the community. We do not want someone who sees only one side of an issue, whether it is that law enforcement is always right or that law enforcement can never be trusted. We want folks who understand the complexity. The majority of the council has said we value law enforcement. We think they are essential to a safe and successful community. But we acknowledge we don't always get it right, and we want to learn from it. So I think throughout this debate, councilmember after council member, not unanimously, but a majority, has said, we want a body that is fair. Councilman Robinson makes a very strong point. We want this to be a body that can make change and that people on multiple sides of the issue will respect. If it is seen as something that only is captured by one segment, it will not be as meaningful to community safety. Very important to understand that people who have strong opinions can still present before this body. So people who have been in law enforcement will have opportunities to share their perspective, as well as people who are currently in law enforcement. The body will also hear from individuals who have lost loved ones or have been deeply impacted by decisions from the Phoenix Police Department. Their perspectives will have a chance to be heard, and it will influence the outcome. The idea is picking people to serve on it who can hear and support all perspectives and respond to it. So I think with the amendment, with two now amendments to Councilwoman O'Brien's, that seems to make sense to me. It is very now narrowly tailored to very specific incidents, but the vast majority of folks can still, who are civilians, serve. So I will be supporting the second motion, which was made first. So, Councilman O'Brien. Yes, sorry, mayor, will you clarify what the two motions are exactly, please? So first, we vote to support it as introduced, which is Councilwoman Guardado's motion, and then we would vote on the motion so that folks who have section 26 complaints in front of the city would not be on the board. Is that right, Denise? Maybe I should have. Denise. Mayor, the current motion on the table is a substitute motion, and that is for approval of the ordinance in this item as recommended by staff. The original motion that was made by council member Robinson and seconded by Councilwoman Stark was to approve, as recommended by staff, but also include a friendly amendment from Councilwoman O'Brien that regarding section 2014 a one, and that included that all voting members shall either reside or work in the city of Phoenix. Members must be 21 years of age. No current or former sworn law enforcement officers or an individual who has filed a claim or lawsuit related to actions by the city of Phoenix Police Department is eligible to serve as a voting member of the board. And that's what I have for that first motion, which was, I understood it differently, so I'm glad that Councilman O'Brien asked. Right. So I guess I wanted clarification because was your request. I had thought you had accepted it, but perhaps I did. Okay. And then did Councilwoman II amend, and Councilman Robinson also accepted it. May I clarify mayor, the acceptance that we just talked about, is that for Councilwoman O'Brien's friendly amendment or does that. Was that friendly amendment for Councilwoman Hodge, Washington I think it was the one from the mayor to accept 20, the 26 right. The mandatory oversight by the oath. So trying to be to take into account Councilwoman pastor's comments that folks who were involved in protests should be able to serve on this, and Councilman Hodge Washington's comments that folks involved in car accidents should be able to serve on this. It was hopefully to really trying to listen to what colleagues had said and meet multiple goals. Councilman Waring, mayor me. We'll go to councilman Waring and then councilman testor. Okay, so the first vote, mayor, and Denise, is Betty's motion. The second vote is the, at least theoretically, Kumbaya bringing together of the amendment and the original motion.

Okay, so the first vote, mayor, and Denise, is Betty's motion. The second vote is the, at least theoretically, Kumbaya bringing together of the amendment and the original motion. So if Betty's thing passes, we never vote on the amendment. I just. That never got said. So we kept talking like there was going to be a second vote a little bit. Not you, mayor, but just generally, people might have gotten confused by that. I was pretty sure I knew, but I want to make sure. So if this first vote passes, then the amendment isn't worth the paper it's written on. It would only be, if that fails, that we get a crack at the second. Correct. Okay, thank you. Councilman pastor. Yes. I'm still a little confused as to what the first motion is. I know, mayor, you. So the first in order of voting would be to approve as introduced. No, I understand that, but what does the amendment, is it your amendment? Is it O'Brien's amendment? Hodge, Washington. There were several conversations. So what is this the first one? I mean, the original motion. Okay, so the one that was made first in the order of the meeting, but would be voted on second would now be, all voting members shall enter either reside or work in the city of Phoenix. Members must be at least 21 years of age. No current or former sworn law enforcement order officer or individual who has filed a claim or lawsuit related to the actions by the city of Phoenix Police Department mentioned in section 26.

Okay, we will move to roll call on Councilwoman Guardado, unless everyone's happy with that one. We'll go to councilman Guardado's motion. Okay, roll call. Galindo, Elvira. Yes. Guardado. Yes. Hodge, Washington. Yes. O'Brien. No. Pastor. Yes. Robinson. No. Waring. No. Stark? No gallego, no bails. Four to five. Now we go to roll call on the motion originally made by Councilman Robinson. Roll call. Galindo. Vida, please do. Can you turn on your microphone? I'm really disappointed. Yeah, I'm really disappointed today because this is not the ordinance that I came prepared to vote for or the one that I discussed with constituents. I feel blindsided. I want there to be a civilian review board. It's important for transparency, democracy. It's important for the public to build trust with law enforcement. And I'm happy to vote on the original, but I can't vote one with a substitution like this. So I vote no. Guardado. Mayor, can I explain my vote? Please do. I'm also going to be voting no. We have gone round and round for many years around oats, around civilian review board, around what this means for our police department, for our community. I think, chief, you've done a wonderful job since you've come here and done all the changes that you have done in our police department, and I'm grateful to you for that. But we also owe it to our community. This was not something easy for the community to accept with all the changes that had to be done because of the changes that have happened at the state level. And I think it's irresponsible for us to change the ordinance. The community was trusting in us, and it was evident that the reason people didn't show up today is because they trusted what we were voting on is what they saw this morning and yesterday. And I think I owe it to them. I owe it to our police department. I am going to be voting no. Hodge, Washington before I cast my vote, I actually have a clarifying question. Please do. And I guess this question is for Julie. I want to understand, because I feel like this is not the right process for us to be making a determination such as this. And I want to understand who can bring a motion for reconsideration if this motion passes. Mayor, members of council. So only a member on the losing side can. Prevailing side. I'm sorry. Prevailing side can bring a motion for reconsideration. And if you're on the prevailing side, do you need the. The support of others that were also on the prevailing side, or can you get the support of those that were on the other side as well? Mayor and members of council. So it only takes one that is on the prevailing side to file for a motion for reconsideration to have it come back on another agenda. Thank you so much for that clarification. I will go ahead and explain my vote. I will vote yes simply so that I can be on the prevailing side. Based on what I have heard here in the conversation, it seems that I will, the concerns that I have are going to be struck. But our rules allow for us to make a motion for reconsideration. And I would like to come back with language that I believe with, in consultation with all of my colleagues in order to present something that addresses all of our concerns. So I will be voting yes for that purpose. O'Brien yes, pastor, can I explain my vote, please? Do. I actually, I actually think that that was a wise decision on Councilman woman Hodge, Washington and I'm just kind of taken aback by all of this.

And who sweeps in? And this doesn't build trust amongst the community, I guess, is where I'm getting at. And with these protests going on and who comes in and starts to remove protesters, it's only going to get bigger. And this was supposed to advance us. The civilian review board would advances with Councilman Guardado's amendment, but this doesn't advance us. And that was the whole purpose of office accountability and transparency. And I understand the moves that are being made and why they're being made, but this doesn't set well in the community on trust of those that don't trust the police. So I'm a no. Robinson Waring mayor, can I ask a clarifying question? Follow up? Please do. Casey's question. So, Denise, for a motion to reconsider, it's going to pass if it gets the votes, and then it'll just appeal passed. I don't know that I've ever seen that. And bringing it back. Councilmember Waring, I apologize. So a reconsideration request can be filed by a council member with the city clerk within seven business days following the original action, which would have been today in terms of trying to reconsider it here. In this particular case, it depends. The council could vote to reconsider an item unless the ordinance failed to pass. But in that case, then that would be like a completely separate motion. So it was my understanding then, for Councilwoman Hodge Washington, that you would be filing potentially a reconsideration with the city clerk. Is that correct? That is my intention based on the vote. Does that make sense? Then? Council member waring so if it passes today, then the councilwoman could submit a reconsideration to city clerk and then it would be brought back in front of the council for another vote. I'm going to vote yes. Stark? Yes. Gallego? Yes. Passes. Six three. Thank you. Thank you. To many individuals who worked long and did a lot of research studying best practices from all over the country so that we could add another tool to public safety in Phoenix. That is our final agendized item. Want to briefly pause before we go to public comment to congratulate Chief Connolly, who will be leaving Phoenix police and serving as the police chief in Flagstaff. Congratulations. Now I'll turn to our city attorney to introduce the final portion. Thank you, mayor. During citizen comment, members of the public may address the city council for up to three minutes on issues of interest or concern to them. The citizen comments session is limited to 30 minutes. The Arizona Open meeting law permits the city council to listen to the comments but prohibits council members from discussing or acting on the matters presented. Thank you. We'll begin with Diane Barker, followed by Nicole Rodriguez. It it's global Love day. You can check it out. May 1. Some of you may remember Jimi Hendrix and, yes, Mayor Kate and Galindo. El Vera, district seven. My name's Diane Barker and I'm here to spread the global love day. We are very fortunate to be people of peace, but we're experiencing over 30 universities or near that that are protesting. We have war in the United States this way. And there are people that are in my peer group, although I really relate and dance in the same beat with 20 year olds. But people may remember the sixties. This is a rendition of it, not exactly the same thing. But the thing is, in global love day, it is a proclamation. It is a real day. May 1 go out, you care about somebody, let them know you love them and have them share that same idea with somebody else. I love you, Phoenix, Nicole. Thank you, mayor. First, I wanted to start off by thanking Councilwoman Hodge Washington for your comments on the civilian review board and spearheading the conversations. Also thank you, council Robinson, for nominating a woman, and a smart woman at that, to division zero advisory board. But I want to quickly go into what I am here today to discuss on the reverse lanes. Phoenix thrives on connection, but outdated reverse lanes on the 7th street and 7th Avenue continue to vied our communities. I launched the end the Reverse Lane campaign summer 2023 to dismantle these relics and revitalize our communities. These lanes are immense. They force detours, isolate residents and cripple local businesses, the lifeblood of our economy. Lost revenue threatens their survival thanks to these outdated relics that prioritize speeding cars over vibrant communities. We need a healthy environment for small businesses, not a highway bypass. Furthermore, these lanes are a slap in the face to Phoenix's progressive vision. Initiatives like Vision Zero and the climate action plan strive for safer, sustainable streets. Reverse lanes stand in defiant opposition, trading a divided urban core and weakening our economy. These lanes are not just inconvenient, they're dangerous.

They force detours, isolate residents and cripple local businesses, the lifeblood of our economy. Lost revenue threatens their survival thanks to these outdated relics that prioritize speeding cars over vibrant communities. We need a healthy environment for small businesses, not a highway bypass. Furthermore, these lanes are a slap in the face to Phoenix's progressive vision. Initiatives like Vision Zero and the climate action plan strive for safer, sustainable streets. Reverse lanes stand in defiant opposition, trading a divided urban core and weakening our economy. These lanes are not just inconvenient, they're dangerous. They force detours, like I said before, that hinder emergency response times when unable to efficiently access a safe left turn access point. Additionally, school bus routes become more complex, increasing travel times, jeopardizing the safety of our children with unnecessary emissions. Adding insult to injury, they violate traffic control standards and require expensive, ineffective upgrades. Digital signs we don't want them. This misallocation of resources takes away from the community's most impacted being district four. Studies show minimal traffic flow benefits in urban cores. Or they don't have benefits in urban cores. With reverse lanes. The solution is pretty clear. It's time to remove them. This action is long overdue. Together with your support through the Phoenix complete Street policy weekend and the reverse lane to end them, not try to accommodate them with signs that are digital in them which don't belong in any city, especially a vibrant city like ours. So let's reunite our communities, revitalize businesses, and create a more livable phoenix. It's time to ditch the reverse lanes and embrace a future where our streets connect us, not divide us. Thank you. Thank you. That is our final speaker. We are adjourned. Hey Detroit, while you're catching snowflakes, we're catching sunburns for our Phoenix residents. Visit Phoenix Dot gov Summer.

And so subsequently you're seeing development in other parts of the city at a greater rate than you had in the past. So there are some cycles, right when I came into office, we were having a lot of for rent product coming to district one, which we're excited to have because predominantly the way the city has grown, you see the density to be in downtown and then the sprawl out through the rest of the districts. And district one is no different. So we're excited to have some of that density up in district one in a way that hopefully is affordable to some of our families. We've had to work with the school district so that they could redo their numbers. They kept saying, well, we only get this many kids out of apartments. And I'm like, you've got to readjust that because families are moving to apartments to be in the north part of Phoenix. Additionally, we're working hard with developers to make sure we offer a variety of products so that we can maybe bring back shared wall products, townhomes, condos, row homes, and bring down some of those costs so we can have homes for those folks who are first time buyers, as well as all those in between. So working hard with the developers, legislators and the city to make that happen. Well, and it does when it gets harder for the younger buyer to get in. Like in district two, we have Paradise Valley school district. They just closed. I think it was four more schools just at a meeting a couple weeks ago. I think that's maybe seven in the last decade or so. That's a lot of public infrastructure that's not being completely utilized. They are renting out the space for different purposes, or trying to anyway, but they've dropped from 33,000 kids down to, I think, 26,000. So when you lose 7000 kids, and that's one of the consequences when it's really expensive. I can't believe the home prices for homes that are then bulldozed. Even in my own neighborhood. I have an empty lot now right across the street from me, where two generations of the same family had lived for decades, I think since the fifties. And now that home is gone. So it's just something that we're seeing that usually Phoenix had been very affordable in the past and it still is compared to New York or San Francisco or Seattle or something. But it's not as affordable as it used to be, for sure. No, it is not as affordable as it used to be. And we, as a city, I think know that we have a housing shortage and are working diligently to make sure we have some of those other options so that we don't price out that new home buyer and can bring back some of those families. I guess one of the advantages of being such a great city to live in, right. Is families don't move out. When families grow up, the moms and dads don't necessarily move on. I know that we still live in the house that we raised our kids in and I love my neighborhood and don't really want to move, but I can also see the school from my driveway. So we're not helping the school situation, but. Well, that's a national phenomenon. I think the average age to move into a retirement facility is now 82. So the baby boomer generation, you know, years older than us, not as many years as I would like, but a few years older than us. They have not been selling their homes, to your point. And I think we're kind of following their lead. So, yes, you are getting some. We had three generations of warings living in my house. My father lived with us until he passed. So he had three Jim Warings actually, all living under one roof, which is probably three too many. A lot of people watching this show, but you are seeing more of that than you had in decades, but you're not seeing enough of it to make up for a 7000 student loss. Right. I mean, it's just, it's so unfortunate. I hadn't, I hadn't heard that they had closed their schools enough. It just happened last week. Yeah. That's so sad. But I hope this revitalization with the, with TSMC and the other companies that are coming and working hard to bring in those new homes will be able to revitalize our school districts and make sure that the kids have good options. And with your experience and school board for, I think it was eight years in the Deer Valley school district. You want to talk about school safety? I'm a parent. I have kids who are in school. They're in school right this minute. Obviously, if you're a parent and you're not at least somewhat thinking about what could happen, not saying it will, obviously, but what could happen then you're not paying attention. So I know that was probably something you addressed as a school board member, you want to give us your thoughts on kind of where things stand with such a pressing public policy issue. So I think it's really important for parents and administrators and the community to be involved in those decisions that should be made at a local level, which we did in Deer Valley, and we had five high schools, thre", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "We've had to work with the school district so that they could redo their numbers...

So I think it's really important for parents and administrators and the community to be involved in those decisions that should be made at a local level, which we did in Deer Valley, and we had five high schools, three junior highs, and most of them had police officers, which is very important. I think it's a great way for kids to connect with and learn about what goes on in their community, that police officers are there for good. I know it's hard to believe, given the statistics or, you know, the stories we see, but children are still incredibly safe in their schools, but things are happening, and so having an officer is important. As you said earlier, it's a struggle, though, for the Phoenix police Department right now, given that we're down about 500, 550 positions. Officers at the school, they're not answering burglary calls. Yes. They're not answering a different kind of call. So we're working hard right now, again, working with the Arizona Department of Education and some other cities who would like to pass some legislation to make it possible for our officers, our retired officers, to come back and work as sros. So that would be incredibly helpful to our numbers if we could have that option. Yeah. And I lose track. I've been to a lot of council meetings over the years. I can't remember if you were there when people were actually protesting about having police officers in certain school districts, which is kind of hard to believe now in this climate, but that was a real thing a couple of years ago. The schools were rejecting the idea that they should have an officer. Yeah, I was not on the council then. However, I do remember it vividly because I was at Deer Valley Unified School district, and while our community did not feel that way. Again, local control is important, but I think you have to have all the information and understand the role of an officer. And some schools weren't using our officers. I shouldn't say our phoenix officers, but weren't using the officers in a proper manner. They're there for all of the school and protect them from certain instances, but they're not there for discipline. So we've come a long way since then, and I'm glad to see it turn around, where communities are welcoming officers back into their schools to develop those positive relationships with kids and to keep them safe. Well, Ann, Councilwoman O'Brien, I know you're gonna be shocked to hear this, but our time is almost up, and I really appreciate you doing this. I told you it would fly by, so hopefully it did for you, but really appreciate you doing this. I think the audience will get a lot out of your insights from both your school service and your service as a public safety chair. So I really can't thank you enough for being here. I hope you have a wonderful holiday season. And if you have any questions or comments, please call my office at 602-262-7445 or visit my website, Phoenix dot Gov District two. And we look forward to seeing you next time. On the building you see to my right is fast approaching its 100th birthday. Up until 1923, the city of Phoenix had no repository for Phoenix specific artifacts. In 1923, Elizabeth Oldacre and the Daughters of the American Revolution created the Arizona Museum Society with the sole purpose of constructing a building that was going to be dedicated to Phoenix specific artifacts. And that's this building. It was called the Arizona Museum. This building was in operation until 1996, when all the artifacts were moved to the Phoenix Museum of History at Heritage Square. This building, even though it's no longer in use as a museum, is on the Phoenix Historic Register and has been since 1989. It's a very good example of a building that was used specifically to house Phoenix history. ADOT connecting Arizona about 13% of Arizonans have little to no broadband access. And in tribal communities, it's even worse, because about 95% of tribal communities simply don't have access to broadband. Internet service providers will be using this technology that we're putting in the ground so that they can provide a service to the public. A really unique element of this is there will be a smartphone highway trust fund, and so the users of this infrastructure will pay a fee to. ADOT will go into a trust fund so that the maintenance of this infrastructure is already paid for by the users. ADOT will be installing a fiber line in one of those ducts, then renting out the other ducts. Once we get the microduct installed between pull boxes, what they do is they get into the pull boxes, they fill up full of lubrication, put the fiber in, and they use a large air compressor and shoot it up to the next pull box. And so in northern Arizona, at some point in the future, we'll be looking at weather detection services that improve driver safety, that help drivers to understand what conditions may be coming up, whether it's snow, heavy rain, ice, drivers can expect within areas that we're working to go down to one lane of traffic, we will be reducing the speed limit to 55 miles an hour.

We do things such as repair and replace h vac units. We can also repair and replace appliances, repair, replace ductwork. We also provide people with led lighting, some of the things that you can do on your own as a homeowner to make your home a little bit more energy efficient. Of course, a smart thermostat is always a good thing because you can control your air conditioning from your phone. Also, we encourage residents to also change out their filters every 30 days and then, if possible, purchase led lighting some behaviors such as doing your laundry later on during the evening when you don't have the high sun. We also encourage residents to probably do some caulking around the house if you have some air infiltration around your windows and your electrical sockets. For more information about the weatherization program, I encourage residents to visit Phoenix Dot Gov Energysavings or you can contact us at 602-5344 hello, I'm Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. What if I told you that the cure for cancer will come through Phoenix, Arizona? I believe that it will. Nearly 20 years ago, the city of Phoenix partnered with business, education, science, and medical visionaries to make a substantial investment in the medical and biosciences. Today, our life science leaders are driving translational disaster, which is also driving our tremendous growth. There are many reasons Phoenix is the fastest growing city in the United States. Our commitment to growing a strong, diverse economy, our support of entrepreneurial ecosystems and our unparalleled quality of life. But as you're about to see, it's also an investment we made 20 years ago that is paying off handsomely. Today, we believe Phoenix is the new land of opportunity. We invite you to join us. There's something happening in Phoenix. It's groundbreaking, it's life changing, and it's driving tremendous growth. Many factors have helped elevate Phoenix to the fifth largest city in the nation, but none has had greater impact than a field that has led to transformative thinking and genomics, precision medicine, molecular medicine, cancer and rare disease research. Bioscience. It's driving translational discovery and Phoenix's rapid ascension from a canal system that brought life to this valley 2000 years ago, to TGen, which helped unravel the mysteries of life. Innovation and collaboration have always driven our rise. Since 2019, our growth in the biosciences and healthcare has been unrivaled in that time, we've added millions of square feet of biomedical space, billions in capital investments in primary facilities, creating thousands of new jobs. That places Phoenix in the nation's top five for emerging life science clusters. The home of Phoenix's translational discovery is the Phoenix biomedical campus, or as we like to call it, the PBC, a thriving 30 acre center of bioscience, research, education and urban life in the heart of a bustling downtown, our welcoming culture of bold thinking and inspiration. Aspiring teamwork was born in 2002 with the International Genomics Consortium IGC and the Translational Genomics Research Institute TGen, an affiliate of the City of Hope, a partnership that has spawned more than 25 companies and thousands of medical breakthroughs, including Ashy in analytics, paradigm diagnostics, and viomics, which are now a part of exec Sciences. Along with Charis Life sciences and vidium animal health, all critical roles in precision medicine, exact sciences has a growing presence on campus. So does NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases main research facility. The newest addition to the campus is 850 pbc, a 227,000 square foot, fully lab enabled building designed for bioinnovation and collaboration. It's home to Arizona State University's translational science, their entrepreneurship and innovation team for biosciences, including their health entrepreneurship accelerator lab Heal Lab. And while the facility is humming with research and discovery, more innovators are always welcome. The center for Entrepreneurial Innovation, CEI, plays a pivotal role on campus by supporting entrepreneurs with their market validation lab program as well as growing companies with lab force, a program for training lab technicians. Education is a critical pillar of the PBC. All three of Arizona's public universities have schools on campus for medical education, research and collaboration.

The newest addition to the campus is 850 pbc, a 227,000 square foot, fully lab enabled building designed for bioinnovation and collaboration. It's home to Arizona State University's translational science, their entrepreneurship and innovation team for biosciences, including their health entrepreneurship accelerator lab Heal Lab. And while the facility is humming with research and discovery, more innovators are always welcome. The center for Entrepreneurial Innovation, CEI, plays a pivotal role on campus by supporting entrepreneurs with their market validation lab program as well as growing companies with lab force, a program for training lab technicians. Education is a critical pillar of the PBC. All three of Arizona's public universities have schools on campus for medical education, research and collaboration. Nowhere else in Arizona will you find three state universities in one place. That's more than 15,000 students working together on or close to the Phoenix Biomedical campus. Looking for collaborators for your research? The universities and innovators on the PBC have close access to critical core services and clinical trials to deliver the latest innovations. For example, the Phoenix Veterans Administration's million vets program partnered with the University of Arizona College of Medicine, Phoenix. This concentration of universities creates a pipeline for talent and access to innovative entrepreneurs through universities and spin outs of existing campus tenants. You also have access to researchers and physician scientists at the surrounding health systems and institutes of research excellence. To inspire the spirit of collaboration, innovators have direct access to on site programs designed to encourage working together both on campus and throughout the community. And innovators. There's still room to grow. 1.7 million sqft has been built. 6 million build out how is this drive for innovation and collaboration working out for us? From 2007 to 2019, the Phoenix Bioscience Healthcare workforce expanded significantly, lifting all sectors of our economy, placing Phoenix among the top cities in the nation for startups and business creation. The PBC isn't the only reason Phoenix is attracting so much talent. Our quality of life is like no other. Did you know Phoenix is home to three of the five largest city parks in the country? South Mountain Preserve, the second largest city park in the US, offers more than 16,000 acres for hiking, biking and horseback riding. Within our city limits, there are more than 250 miles of trails. We also have nearly 1000 miles of bike paths and bike lanes. Worried about traffic? Don't be. 90% of those living in Phoenix have less than a 30 minutes commute, shortest of any of the top 15 cities in the nation. And Phoenix Sky harbor, one of the nation's busiest and friendliest airports, is also one of the most convenient, only a ten minute drive from the PBC. There are so many ways to escape the award winning dining, our coffee shops and breweries, our music and festival scene, including first Fridays, the largest monthly art festival in the country. Like sports, there's plenty to root for new arrivals. Also like our low pressure attitude and how easy it is to fit in. We like to say, no one's a stranger here, and new explorers are always welcome. There's something happening in Phoenix. It's driving life changing discoveries, industry shaping innovations. And with so much room to grow limitless opportunities, the future is Phoenix bioscience. Join us. I was homeless for five years. Dominique Flores needed a fresh start after moving to Arizona in late 2021. I had a handful of things happen to me within a one week period to where I had to find new employment. Because of COVID I got in a car accident. She found the support she needed through local nonprofit St. Joseph the worker, Richard one of the workers at St. Joseph picked me up from the hospital after my car accident and so super, super grateful for that alone. But that ride was just the beginning of her journey. So when it comes to being homeless, they didn't let me get to the point of going that direction anymore. And once I sought the help through St. Joseph the worker, it was a matter of being able to say, okay, I want that help and I want to be sober minded and I want to be able to work and stay on my feet. Not just get on my feet, but stay on my feet. Dominique enrolled in St. Joseph. The Workers Workforce Villages program. So the Workforce Village program is a 90 day transitional housing program that allows clients who are successfully employed making at least $17 an hour to have a 90 day period where they can save 80% of their post tax check in their own bank accounts. Darren Strunk is their chief operating officer. He says the program also teaches participants important life skills to help them succeed long term. We also provide financial literacy, budgeting, financial coaching so they can make successful exits into their own housing. At day 91. With their own money, clients can have their own kitchens and do meal prep and be able to food shop and budget. The Phoenix City Council approved $2 million of American Rescue Plan act funding for the workforce Village program so more people can become financially independent. The best part about this program for me is that people who exit this program exit without any further assistance. They leave this program with their own lease, maybe a shared lease with a friend, but they're not receiving vouchers or any sort of public assistance. Rachel Milne, director of the Office of Homeless Solutions, says the city is excited to add this program to its workforce development options to help people find find a place to call home. The St. Joseph the worker program is a pretty intense short term program, but when they exit this program, they exit with the life skills and the ability to end their homelessness permanently.

So this is it. This is. I didn't make it, but it's definitely the, this is it. This is, this is what I was able to accomplish. With St. Joseph the workers assistance and support, Dominique is now sitting soaking up the Arizona sunsets from the balcony at her apartment. The view is the best thing about the apartment complex, a place that means the world to her. At the end of the day, I usually just head out there and beat the ducks right off the balcony. And she's proud to pay for on her own, thanks to the value she learned in just three short months. And so St. Joseph the worker was basically not a crutch for me. It was like a step up and it wasn't a stepping stone. It was a step up for me. It has allowed me to have structure, it has kept me sober, it has kept me on the right road, and it has taken me beyond lengths that I could have ever wished for. I have my first vehicle I've ever had. I'm 46, I have a wonderful job and I mean, I couldn't ask for a better job. It's a miracle. It's a true miracle, has paid off and it continues to pay off. Like I said, it doesn't come easy. It's a lot of hard work, but it's so worth it. Welcome to the Cesar Chavez Community center, the city of Phoenix's newest recreation center here in the beautiful Levine village. Come, I'll take you around.

Early in the morning, I was over at the Happy Valley town Center with keep Phoenix beautiful at their icycle Phoenix event, and then they had lines going all through the parking lot and folks were showing up to not only bring in their shredding, but also get rid of their electronics and make donations of food, water and clothing for the homeless, as well as providing stuff to treasures for teachers who has locations all across our state. So thank you very much to keep Phoenix beautiful for that annual event. Later in the morning, I got to join a couple of my colleagues, Councilwoman Ansari as well as councilwoman pastor at the 41st annual St. Patrick's Day parade and festival. We joined Irish Minister of State Thomas Byrne and Consul General of Ireland Marcella Smith. So it was a wonderful event, thanks to all the police officers, fire department was there and all the folks who helped out with the festival. On Saturday afternoon, Phoenix sister City's Taipei committee hosted, along with ASU west, the second annual mahjong Mash. Eventually I was able to win my first game and got to hang out with all the other folks who came to learn mahjong at ASU west. We had so many folks show up that they're actually thinking about doing this on a more regular basis, maybe even as often as quarterly. And then Sunday was the official kickoff for the fourth annual Phoenix Police Honor Week. My office partnered with the Phoenix Police foundation to host the first in person five k run and walk event for the kickoff. I want to thank all the businesses and companies who sponsored the event and had their volunteers show up. It was a huge success. And the first runner who did the five k clocked in at just over 20 minutes. That was really amazing. I want to thank Chief Mike Sullivan and his lovely wife Jamie for participating in the race with us. This year's route took participants past two memorial markers in North Phoenix, Commander Greg Carnicle and Officer Rusty Hawkins. My hope is to move the event every year to be able to visit more markers and to remember all of our fallen officers. If you didn't get to a chance to participate in that big event yesterday or on Sunday, there's still time to participate virtually. Or you can go to a number of the other events that are happening this week. You can go to phoenixhonorrun.com to sign up for a virtual or another in person event. Thank you, mayor. Thank you so much. We'll go next to Councilwoman Ansari and then councilwoman pastor thank you, mayor. I have a brief PowerPoint. First, I want to wish everyone a happy Naurus. We had an incredible third annual Nauru celebration this Saturday at Civic Space park with well over 2000 attendees from across the central asian diaspora who celebrate Noruz and many newcomers who came to celebrate the arrival of spring. Growing up, the Persian New Year has always been one of the most special occasions of the year in my family, and it's been an honor to share this tradition with Phoenix over the last three years. Our first year at City hall was very emotional for many of the new afghan refugees who had just made Phoenix home. And this last year we had a, this last, last weekend we had a global night market and resource fair as well as live performances and a special appearance from Grammy award winner Hamid Saidi, who's the first Iranian American who's ever been awarded with a Grammy. We also had amazing food and dancing. Thank you so much to the international Rescue Committee, ASU and the Persian Cultural center for helping us put on this event. If you've never celebrated Noruz before, I highly recommend you do so tonight. Not a religious holiday, just simply a day to set new intentions. Next slide, I don't know if this slide shows up, but next slide is about tenants right to council. Tomorrow we will have a right to council discussion at our economic development and housing subcommittee. I want to thank council member Kevin Robinson for allowing us to bring this discussion forward and for the unemployed workers united for their advocacy. Shortly, we will have a discussion on our budget, our shortfalls, and our priorities. And I know many of us have talked about the need to invest in programs and prioritize programs that are not just bandages to the homelessness crisis, but will actually prevent increased homelessness in our community. And I really think that this is a program that will help do that. In Maricopa county, there were 84,000 individuals who face the prospect of losing their homes through eviction in 2023, and on average, 94% of landlords have legal representation and eviction proceedings, while that number is only 1% for tenants. This lopsided legal system for evictions means many more phoenicians become chronically housing insecure and financially insecure. They're much more likely to end up homeless and jobless. Phoenix has already invested in an initiative like this. We have a pilot program with community legal services to provide legal assistance for a small number of low income tenants faci", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Happy Valley Town Center", "insights":

Shortly, we will have a discussion on our budget, our shortfalls, and our priorities. And I know many of us have talked about the need to invest in programs and prioritize programs that are not just bandages to the homelessness crisis, but will actually prevent increased homelessness in our community. And I really think that this is a program that will help do that. In Maricopa county, there were 84,000 individuals who face the prospect of losing their homes through eviction in 2023, and on average, 94% of landlords have legal representation and eviction proceedings, while that number is only 1% for tenants. This lopsided legal system for evictions means many more phoenicians become chronically housing insecure and financially insecure. They're much more likely to end up homeless and jobless. Phoenix has already invested in an initiative like this. We have a pilot program with community legal services to provide legal assistance for a small number of low income tenants facing evictions, and since its start in 2020, we have been able to assist 15,509 individuals. I'm hoping for a phased expansion of this program with the adoption of a right to council ordinance, and there's a lot of other cities in the United States who have done this with tremendous results. So I'm looking forward to the conversation in our subcommittee tomorrow. And finally, I want to touch on upcoming events. If you could go to the last slide, please. We have a number of events this weekend in district will be at the Phoenix Pride Rainbows festival at Heritage square. The annual festival highlights the many incredible organizations in Phoenix who support our LGBTQ community, from physical and mental health services to education and social groups. Please come out and say hello to us. I'm also very excited to launch service at our Phoenix bookmobile in the Estrella Village. This was approved in our budget during my first budget cycle in 2021, and we're going to be having a celebration over at Santa Maria park at 11:00 a.m. and soon, thanks to our advocacy through the Gobon program, this region of District Seven will have its first branch library and civic space park constructed. And on the note of celebrating libraries, I want to wish a very happy early retirement to Rita Hamilton for her 50 years of service as a librarian. 13 of those spent serving Phoenix extremely well. Thank you for all you've done for our city. Thank you, Mayor Rita, why don't you stand up and we can thank you for your service to the city of Phoenix decades and decades, helping us have one of the best library systems anywhere. So thank you. We'll go next to councilwoman, pastor, and then councilwoman Guardado I'll wait for the slides. I'll speak on one of them. Join me with the Phoenix police and neighborhood services for a free coffee and a discussion about hot topics in district four on April 10 at Luana's coffee near Thomas and 15th Avenue. As you can see, you can scan a code to RSVP. Next slide recently, we helped two local business owners improve bus stops in front of their establishments. The bus stop near the boom boom room at McDowellan 16th street was replaced with a newer stop and moved 20ft east. Luana's coffee reached out to our office to have the bus stop in front of their establishment replaced to continue the improvements owners Erin and Kylie have been working on near Thomas and 15th Avenue. Next slide the CV's project health van is coming to district four. My office will be hosting the mobile clinic in partnership with CV's pharmacy at Indian School and 19th Avenue next Wednesday. Next slide we will be hosting our third annual fifth k with the African American Reconstruction April 6 at 08:00 a.m. at Steele Indian School park. Support local black vendors and get some steps in. All proceeds will fund educational programs for the youth in the valley. Councilwoman Hajj Washington and I hosted boobs, bubbles and brunch at the historic Carver Museum to kick off Women's History Month and celebrate the launch of a special program, a partnership with MSiR Cancer center who are doing a study to detect cancer earlier and black women who have historically been underserved in the cancer screening field. All slots for free breast cancer screenings were filled in the matter of days. The Coronado Neighborhood association hosted their annual Oak Street Mural Festival this past weekend, highlighting the incredible artwork in the alley between 14th and 15th street. They're some of my favorites. Pictures, of course, are the favorites that I liked during that Saturday. Zul, the puppy pup and our incredible district four student interns. Next slide Abby and Derek were a huge hit during the St. Patrick's Day parade this weekend. You see the, you see her, you see, you see the dog really built platform for her, so she was a hit. Thank you to the St. Patrick's Day parade committee for organizing this very important cultural celebration every year in Phoenix, and a very special shout out to Commander Jeff Benza, who drove us around in his mustang.

This week, our focus remains on enhancing public safety measures and fostering stronger community bonds through various gatherings and events. This Thursday, March 21 at Cactus Park Police precinct, we will celebrate the grand opening and ribbon cutting of the real time operations center, the first of its kind in the city of Phoenix as part of the 27th Avenue Community Safety Plan passed in 2022. The plan was to address community safety through a multi department collaboration, collaborative approach, leveraging technology and community based resources. I still remember the meeting that we attended where we had a little bit over 100 people come out and talk to us about the challenges that they were seeing on their streets, having to put blindfolds over their children's eyes as they were driving by 27th Avenue and seeing the activity when it came to drugs, when it came to prostitution, and neighbors came out and said that enough was enough and held us accountable to coming up with a plan to help us address a lot of these challenges. One of the key focuses areas and strategies of the CSP is crime detection and response. This strategy focuses on reducing violent crime and quality of life offenses through the Phoenix Police Department's use of real time operations center in conjunction with field operations and criminal investigations. The center will feature state of the art technology including gunshot detectors, license plate readers and tilt point Zoom cameras that will relay real time information into the RTLCs to assist the police department with field operations and criminal investigations. Additionally, the RTLCs use advanced data analyst to integrate streaming video, real time alerts, resource tracking, social media analytics, voice and computer aided dispatch, and records information into a single intuitive interface with layered geospatial mapping. Friends, this is a big deal. This was a heavy lift for my office, city leadership and staff and other console offices and an incredible achievement by our police department to get this done. I am so grateful to all who work to bring the RTLC to life. When I took office, making our city safer was my top priority and while building an RTLC was unchartered territory for the city, I am proud to have led in this very important endeavor. The RTLC is a game changer and a major advancement in keeping our community safe. Moving on on Saturday, March 30 will be our Easter Jubilee at Homestead park. The city of Phoenix Parks Department and partners will host the Niester Jubilee event at John F. And Mary P. Long Homestead park. This Easter event will feature egg hunts and games, activities, music, food trucks and a chance for families to take pictures with the Easter Bunny. The egg hunts will be available for youth ages zero to twelve and will include an egg hunt for people living with disabilities on Sunday, April 7, 2024. From twelve to four, we will have our fourth Maryville Mercado join us along the park at 55th Avenue from Campbell to Glenrosa Avenue. Enjoy live cultural performances and music, explore local small businesses, savor food vendors and shop at unique stalls. This is a free monthly outdoor event in partnership with local first Arizona and Cartwright School District.

As you know, the trial budget is a very critical step, an instrumental step in our budget development process. And today's trial budget follows the February 27 multi year forecast. During that forecast, we did talk to you about the fact that we do have a balanced budget for fiscal year 24 25, but we also have a one time surplus of about $80 million. Today's presentation, as I alluded to on that February 27 presentation, my recommendation is that we set that $80 million to the side in a reserve fund and I set aside so that it would help us as we move forward and strategically think about how we're going to balance the 25 26 and 26 27 budget that, unfortunately, because of state action, is putting us under duress in those fiscal years as a result of their action as it pertains to residential rental tax as well as the flat tax that was implemented under Governor Doug Ducey. So as we move forward today, what I want to emphasize is that we are fortunate to be here with a balanced budget, given all the economic uncertainty and the negative actions that have been placed upon us at the state level. But at the same time, this budget is one that I'm happy. We can tell our residents that we can protect the services that they've come to love and expect that we as a city provide. But it is also a budget that by setting aside that $80 million, it gives us a fighting chance as we look ahead to 25 26 and beyond, as well as just being strategically long term and thinking not just in the current moment, but thinking long term what's best for the city. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Amber Williamson, who will walk you through the details. Thank you, Jeff. Mayor, members of the council and public here today. Happy to be here to present the fiscal year 24 25 proposed city manager's trial budget on the agenda today, I'm going to recap the general fund budget status and multi year forecasts that I presented to the council and the community on February 27. I'll then go over the proposed 24 25 trial budget. I'll talk about steps we're going to take to make sure we can engage the residents in the budget process and then talk about next steps in the budget adoption process. Before I get into recapping our general fund status and multi year forecast, I wanted to provide for residents listening today an overview of our city budget. So, our city budget is made up of 30% of our general fund. This is our unrestricted fund. It provides the resources for our core programs and services, such as police and fire, parks and libraries, neighborhood and human services, as well as our administrative functions. And then 40% of the city budget is made up of special revenue funds. These are restricted for a specific purpose and include our voter approved tax funds for public safety, parks and preserves, transportation 2050, as well as our Arizona Highway User revenue fund that provides for street improvements. And then enterprise funds make up about 30% of our city budget. These are our departments that function more like a business. They generate their revenue from the fees they charge for individuals who use their services. So departments such as aviation, water, wastewater and solid waste so, focusing on our general fund to recap what was presented to you on February 27, our estimated resources for next fiscal year, 2,096,000,000. We take that less our estimated costs, 2,016,000,000. And we arrive at that total surplus of 80 million for next fiscal year. That is considered to be one time funds, mostly made up of a carry forward of excess balance from last fiscal year and some savings in capital pay as you go projects. More information on that is included in your packet today. So, recapping our general fund multi year forecast again, presented on February 27, we start that first year 24 25. There's that $80 million surplus. As you can see, though unfortunately, as referenced by our city manager, actions by the state eliminate residential rental January of 25 as well as reducing the individual income tax, we are projecting deficits ranging anywhere from 103 million to 66,000,025 26 deficits again in 26 27 53 million to a potential surplus of 19 million. The baseline forecast for the general fund deficit of 92,000,025 26 and 31,000,026 27 for a combined amount of just over 120 million. However, if we do add back in the reductions for the, you know, the impacts from the state, we are looking at a potential surplus of what would have been in 24 25, 134 million minor deficit of 6,000,025 26. That's something we would be able to resolve and then surpluses in 26 27 of about 55 million estimated. So it's for these reasons that our city manager is proposing to set aside the $80,000,000.01 time surplus in reserve. We want to make sure that we can preserve all the programs and services that our residents rely on, everything from our parks and our libraries to ensuring our public safety is funded appropriately. We want to make sure those resources are available next fiscal year. As I work with my budget research team to craft the 25 26 status that I'll bring back to you next February, we also want to make sure that we have resources going forward ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "There will also be food trucks and health screenings.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We are projecting deficits ranging anywhere from 103 million to 66 million for 25-26 deficits.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "This budget is one that I'm happy.

As I work with my budget research team to craft the 25 26 status that I'll bring back to you next February, we also want to make sure that we have resources going forward and our budget remains structurally balanced so we have the capacity to bring on all of those 47 projects you're going to hear about shortly in our preliminary capital improvement program presentation, we want to make sure those resources are there so those geo bond projects can open as they're scheduled. The budget does include converting resources for ongoing positions in the budget, 30 full time equivalent positions are being requested. These are critical positions needed mostly for the general fund and two for our development services fund. Again, this isn't requiring additional funds. We've worked with city departments to identify the resources to provide for these position conversions. These are mostly made up of temporary positions converting to ongoing for communications, neighborhood services, council, finance, public works, police and our planning and development department. So engaging the community we know it's a priority of you, the council, as well as it is for city staff to make sure residents have many opportunities, many ways that the process is inclusive and open for all to attend, ways residents can participate we're holding eleven community budget hearings in the community as well as two hybrid meetings in the chamber. We encourage the council to attend those to hear input from residents that may attend virtually. Residents can go to our website, Phoenix dot Gov budget. They can email, budget and research. They can give us a call. They can follow it on social media and make comments that way. Waze we're trying to advertise and market working with our communications department, doing lots of social media ads, radio we've put information in the PEI's newsletter. We've distributed flyers through multiple departments. I also want to know we will provide spanish interpretation services for residents who may need that, and then also our fun Phoenix tool. It's updated with the trial budget. It'll be updated and provided later on our website later this month. It is available in both English and Spanish. As we always do, all input we receive from residents will be communicated to the council before you're required to make budget decisions on May 21. So that brings me to next steps for budget adoption. May 7 we'll come back after we take the budget to the community. We'll present to you a city manager's proposed budget on May 21. We will ask council to make decisions on the budget. It's a very critical date. We cannot move forward to legal budget adoption without that. May 29 it's scheduled for tentative budget adoption. On June 12 is final budget adoption, and then we will wrap it up on July 1 with property tax levy adoption. And with that I can answer any questions on the proposed trial budget. Thank you. Don't see any questions. So if you want to go to Cip. Absolutely. So I am here with deputy budget director Chris Fazio. He is over our capital team and we're going to present to you our preliminary 24 29 capital improvement program. Our CIP includes all of the resources, programmed expenditures to provide for our infrastructure to make sure that our assets are appropriately taken care of and built. We're also going to highlight the exciting Geo Bond program recently approved by the voters. So without further ado, I will hand it over to Chris Fazio. Good afternoon, Mayor and council, where the operating budget is driven by employees and ongoing services. The CIP is the city's infrastructure budget. The proposed program totals $11 billion across five years, including $3 billion next fiscal year. The program includes almost 900 projects and leverages available grant funding and partner agency funding. You'll also see the full 2023 Geo Bond program within this five year CIP. The CIP mostly represents aviation, water, wastewater, transit and street transportation and drainage infrastructure. 19 additional programs make up about 20% of the CIP. By funding source $211 million is proposed from the general fund $500 million in 2023 geo bond funds that were approved by voters in November, supplemented by $1 million in remaining 2001 and 2006 geo Bond fund proceeds. Most CIP funding comes from special revenue funds such as highway user revenues, enterprise funds like water and airport revenues, bond funds backed by restricted funds and other capital funds like development impact fees. This past November, voters approved all four geo bond questions for the 2023 bond program. The preliminary CIP reflects the bond projects recommended by the Citizens Bond committee that were presented to council in December 2022. I'll go over a summary of those projects in a moment.

The first bond sales plan to occur this summer, with expenditures starting next fiscal year. Planning efforts are already underway, though, and some minor costs associated with development studies and environmental assessments may occur this fiscal year. To recap the bond program, the first proposition included $214 million in fire, police, streets and storm drainage. This includes replacement of cactus park precinct renovations to the Maryvale precinct and police property management warehouse, a new fire station at 51st Avenue and Loop 303 replacement of three existing fire stations with new larger stations, mobility improvements flood mitigation infrastructure in Levine and on the northeast side of South Mountain accelerated pavement maintenance in neighborhoods and roadway safety measures.

Minor park improvements along with facility improvements at Esteban and Mountain View parks new parks and libraries at 99th Avenue and Lower Buckeye and at Deer Valley and Tatum expansion of the Yucca Branch library improvements to Margaret T. Hans park roadway safety efforts at South Mountain construction of regional pools at Maryville and Harmon parks and replacement of existing smaller pools with splash pads mitigation of ADA deficiencies at city facilities and funding for historic preservation grants.

I won't attempt to cover all the hundreds of other projects in this program, but examples include improvements to Sky Harbor Airport, park upgrades, construction of the planned Lone Mountain park bus rapid transit and light rail expansion, street improvements, continuation of the pavement maintenance program, construction of the Cave Creek water reclamation plant and improvements to the city's water infrastructure. Today's high level overview of the CIP is information. Over 300 pages of detail are available on the Phoenix Dot Gov budget website. In the coming months, staff will update the preliminary CIP to reflect carryovers, updated cost estimates and updated resource estimates, and we'll return to you in May and June for adoption of the five year CIP legal budget, adoption steps and property tax levy adoption in July. With that, we can take any of your questions. Thank you so much. Exciting investments throughout our city. We'll go first to the vice mayor. Thank you, mayor. And I think Chris already mentioned this, but maybe I want him to stress it. Amber came to my community chat this month and talked about the budget, and I think, you know, it was shocking to some of my residents how much money we're going to lose through the rental tax. And one of them came up to me afterwards and said, hey, wait a minute. Is this going to affect our day to day operations? For example, if I call in for a pothole, are you guys going to be able to fix it? If I see a swing that's disabled at a park, are you guys going to be able to take care of that? And so, Chris, maybe you can reiterate what you had in your slides, that the day to day operations are still going to be there. It's really taking on new projects other than what we invested in the bond election. And so if you could just reiterate that and make her feel a lot better, I appreciate it. Thank you. Vice mayor, actually, for the question, I think I'll go ahead and answer that. It's for that exact reason we want to make sure we can preserve all programs and services.

It looks like all of the things were budget priorities last year still continue to be important. We added a lot of investments in fire service to improve response times. Public records requests we added in that area. We're still not there yet. So I think we got to keep working in all of those areas for our growing city. Comments all right, then we will go to public comments. Thank you so much for the hard work to get us here today and the work still to come. We will begin with Sebastian del Portillo, followed by Dvidi Hernandez. Hi. Good afternoon, council. Thank you for that synopsis of the city budget. My name is Sebastian del Portillo. I am a resident of Phoenix, and I am the campaign manager with the take back our homes campaign. Now, we are standing here today in solidarity, and we stand with Bodet in action in support of the priorities of the people's budget. These priorities are not without merit as they result from thousands of conversations with community members in the city. These priorities represent the needs of the community that has been the most impacted by racists, an economically exploitative history of the city, and the legacy of the city. And I say this not to instigate, but because we have to recognize the history that has shaped our today, the experiences of heat exhaustion and deaths from heat is unlike anywhere else in the country. 645 people have died last year due to heat. 645. And what we need is really straightforward. One, we demand funding to increase the number of water fountains at parks and outside city of Phoenix buildings to provide the basic human need of water. We need funding full right to council. Thank you, Councilwoman Ansari, for bringing this up and really pushing this. Many of the people currently on the streets who are living in their vehicles have been through our eviction system. An eviction system which is fast, it's confusing, it's cruel, it's dehumanizing. This process of eviction is also backed by the threat of violence. And it gives power to those with wealth and property over those without. So we demand funding for right to counsel on evictions, to provide fair trials, due process, and eviction court, keeping our communities housed, and giving them a chance to remain safe and stable out of the fatal heat. And we also need to increase the number of permanent supportive housing units for people. What's happening in the city is unbelievable. It should not be normalized. And we have to listen to our community and their demands. Thank you. BD is next, followed by Stephanie. Good afternoon. I'm here to talk about the budgets, you know, just want to talk about the $80 million and making sure that that goes out to community, especially as we're facing one of the biggest crisis in housing. In heat, you name it. We talked about earlier in the presentation, what is best for the city. And what is best for the city is for people to stay alive and for people to stay sheltered. And those are priorities that we should have in this budget. $80 million could be critical. Life saving resources. Last year, we had some of the highest debts by heat. We had increased number of unsheltered people. We have had major cases of eviction. All of these things can be addressed not only for the moment, but for the future of this city. So every dollar that doesn't go into a community is money that is potentially life costing. I just met someone earlier that talked about how during COVID there was a lot of eviction support, and there was even a moratorium to suspend, you know, paying for rent. And even though that was in place, people were still being evicted. A lot of our members have been evicted, especially when they live in trailer homes and in communities that were the renting space, that not only are they being evicted, they are also their properties being taken from them. Having legal representation makes all the difference. We have had struggles, like, even just. We've coordinated immigration lawyers to show up for housing support. And even that immigration lawyer that doesn't know much about housing has been the difference between someone staying home or being unsheltered. And so we're urging the city to invest in legal support services for people being evicted, to invest in portable water and accessible water for our unsheltered community. And this money can also come from the police", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "We demand funding to increase the number of water fountains at parks and outside city of Phoenix buildings to provide the basic human need of water.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Many of the people currently on the streets who are living in their vehicles have been through our eviction system.

And this money can also come from the police department. $1 billion is being held there. So there is money. Not only the 8 million, but another billion dollars that you can move. Stephanie Gonzalez is next, followed by Shaile Flores. Stephanie Gonzalez. I'm also here to speak on the trial budget. For the past five years, we have spoken to tens of thousands of people that have named housing climate, mental health, and substance use as major overlapping concerns. So I'm here to demand council to invest those $80 million that constitute the surplus of this upcoming budget. To put it towards the following three things. Increase the number of water fountains at and outside buildings that the city owned and their spaces. Create an emergency eviction legal services program for people facing evictions or experiencing tenant rights violations. And increase the number of permanent supportive housing units for people that do not have housing and shelter. For this budget year, you gave the housing department only $2 million from the general fund. That is like a day of what the police department gets. The police department got $741 million and allocated money for 21 new job positions. They don't need any more money. They don't need any more job positions. We need money for the people. We need money for the community. You're asking what the city needs, but you're not asking, what does the people in your city need? And that's what you should be actually focusing on. Shailay is next, followed by Blanca Chalet. I'm encouraging you to revise your strategy for resolving the housing crisis. But I want to start with a short story. There once was an individual who used to work for the city of Phoenix who attempted to gracefully and compassionately push the city to examine its inherent white supremacy and patriarchy. This effort was cut short, and that employee attempting this work was essentially blacklisted and pushed out of her position and out of city government. The person who led that witch hunt was none other than our current mayor that's what solidified my belief that this council is not committed to growth or improvement of people's lives, but in maintaining the status quo. We have examined the city's inherent capitalist tendencies and how they've led you on a trajectory of not only abandoning Phoenicians but dehumanizing us as well. The housing and unsheltered crisis is not a failure of the individual but a failure of governance. The trial budget as is does not address these crises because it is surface level. What it needs is significant preventative services that create long term solutions. Where you ought to start is go back and humanize the people who do not have housing and shelter. You do that by halting police sweepings. You do that by increasing the number of water fountains at parks and buildings so that people can hydrate during the summer. As my community has said, you do that by increasing the number of supportive housing units. All of this is written in the pueblo's budget and we are prepared to fight back as you attempt to push us out. Blanca proxima Maria Alonso Buena stardes Minambrez Blanca isoy del distritos.

Sure. I just wanted to respond to this. The context here is we're working to get Blanca's dance group a permanent space for the next ten months or so. We've been working with parks that require insurance forms that, unfortunately, are not simple, but we're really working to get them done over the next couple of weeks. So we'll keep you posted on that and we'll continue, continue to have a direct line on this issue and anything else. We've been working with Blanca directly, the team has.

Maria Alonso and Helena, good afternoon. I am here today so that you can see about the housing. There's a lot of people in our community when it has to do with water, especially now when there is a lot of. When it's getting hot with the heat. We also need help, those of us that are immigrants, because we also pay taxes and. And I don't want any more money going to the police. No one can call the police department anymore because what they do is they get there and they just. She says that they call the police department and the police department will come and what they have seen is that police comes and kills the community. That's what she said. I didn't hear the last phrase. Excuse me. Que fuela ultima cosa que dijo que vine la policia que que llano yamal uno la policia. Por que lo quega matra las Personas because when people. When the police department is called, it is to kill people. That's all. Thank you, Angelina. Maricella, sorry, can I ask permission to just support in translating? Because we're really missing not only words, but, like, thoughts and context. I think we need to stick with our translator. We're really missing accurate. Like, you're not getting the accurate message. Okay. Buenos tarisa, todos. Okay. Good afternoon to all. Estamosaki. We are here because we need to see that something is done for the community. Estamon mirandolos parques. We are seeing homeless individuals that are filling up our parks when they tell us we are going to have more safe parks. Estamos Mirando. We are seeing that the rent, they're just incrementing. They're very high. So we have to make a harsh decision. Do we pay the rent or do we buy groceries? We know that there's four, maybe five children in each home, and they're all starving. They need food. We know that the priority here, it's not the people, because we've been waiting for these changes for years, and they have not been realized. Each and every year, we see more and more people without a home, more poor individuals, more poverty, more deaths. More deaths because of the heat, more people suffering on the streets when it's cold out. And we know and are finding out that. But we're not finding out that human pain does not matter to you very much. We would like to see that we have more support within the community, and we know we do not have a lot of information por numeros y ayuda numeros, because we don't have enough help. We don't have help when there's a crisis or help when they're for people that are suffering from, whether it be addictions or any other things. The reason why we always come here and we reflect on 911. Excuse me. That is the reason that the police department is not prepared for crisis. And we would like to see that they would get more help. There would be an increase in help for crisis situation and for mental health. It would be good because it would be better than the way things are now. The Maryville. And if one day you walked through the Maryvale parks and the housing there, you would realize what really is happening there. Thank you very much. Just to do a clear, really clear, just reminder. I'm sorry, clarity. So she was saying that there's not enough crisis lines, enough places to call for help, and so support, which is why they end up calling 911 for things that might not be 911 things to call.

So that the police department can. Mayor. Because they're harassing. Nothing is being translated, right? I don't know. Yeah, I'm sorry. If we can just have Vidi or someone else come up and translate. I'm getting text messages. No one's understanding what's being translated. Maybe we can switch to. Is Mario available? We can maybe switch out with Mario. Mayor, we can switch with Mario. It will just take a few minutes since he's translating in the headsets right now, so we'll have to. Okay, great. Thank you. Do you want me to read this again? I just think we need. Because you keep interrupting her. She forgets what she's saying. She goes back and says it again, then you go back and say it. And I just think that translation is taking a lot longer. Well, I'd like to state that she's reading a documentary. She's looking down and I'm trying. Okay, la bolla duchova. So I understand Mario is available to translate from downstairs, so continue.

They don't have $1,700 to pay a rent, so they end up staying out on the cars with their kids. Gracias. Thank you, Isabel. And then Bertha. I oppose this trial budget. For decades, the city of Phoenix has strategically neglected black, indigenous, immigrant, and disabled communities, giving us more police instead of investing in the essential resources and services that we need to survive and thrive. The Phoenix Police Department is one of the deadliest in the country. And yet, in this current fiscal year, Phoenix police received almost $1 billion. As mentioned earlier, this trial budget allocates money for 21 new job positions related to the police department. The cops do not need more money. This money must go toward infrastructure for affordable housing. As my comrades have said, we have spoken to thousands of people directly impacted by the strategic neglect, and we created the Pueblos budget, a people's budget that highlights housing, climate and mental health and substance use as major overlapping concerns. A right to counsel is just one of numerous critical interventions needed to keep more tenants stably housed and to reduce homelessness. Today, we are demanding that the city add three items from the Pueblos budget to this trial budget. One, create an emergency eviction legal services program for people facing evictions or experiencing tenant rights violations. Two, increase the number of permanent supportive housing units for people who do not have housing or shelter. And three, increase the number of water fountains at parks and outside city owned buildings and spaces. Thank you, Petra. And then, Maria Sanchez. Hola. Buenas tardes. Hello. Good afternoon.

The stuff that we really need. People from the community. Ever since Covid-19 lots of people have been left out without a home and they're now living out in the streets. And sadly, it's our people from the Maryville area. Right? So we are the people that have been impacted the most. We're the most vulnerable people. You guys aren't searching out solutions for our needs, for our problems. The only thing that you're giving us is criminalizing our actions, our neighborhoods. What I heard in this budget is that you're going to be investing more money and more cops. Yes. No mass problemas. And that is not the solution to our problems. What we need is solutions to the problems, not more problems. And me being somebody that does have rights because I do pay taxes, I demand that you invest money in our needs. Gracias. Thank you. Maria Sanchez followed by rebecca good afternoon. My name is Maria Sanchez. I'm a Phoenix resident, district three, and I am here with my comrades to oppose this budget. The Pueblos budget did inform me and educate me on the 80 million surplus this year. And I disagree with the city manager's recommendations. I just want to uplift what Biryana shared earlier. We do need to actually be investing in things that are going to keep our communities alive. All these demands that we have made all intersect and I have personally been impacted by these. The lack of investment from this city and those things. $2 million for housing when that's what we were giving the police is unacceptable. We need to actually be investing in our shelter community who are experiencing the heat that's coming. Like us that have housing, we already are bracing for that. I can't even imagine our shelter community. We need to actually increase the number of permanent and supportive housing units and we actually need to create an emergency eviction legal service program since our eviction rates keep increasing every single year. Thank you Rebecca followed by Luke. I am Rebecca Denis. I live in district seven. I'm in opposition of this budget and in support of the Pueblos budget and echo what has already been said by my fellow community members. This 80 million surplus being suggested for a rainy day reserve fund. It's needed now. Citizens in Phoenix are currently facing rainy days now. They are facing storms. They are sopping wet. Folks are drowning in the floods of these metaphorical, economically unjust rains. We are in the middle of a housing crisis that apparently neither our state nor any city or governments can seem to get on the same page about on how to address and they're not able to provide relief for so many people struggling to keep a roof over their own heads or the people that are already on the street. Please increase the number of water fountains at parks and outside city buildings and spaces. Create an emergency eviction legal services program for people facing evictions or experiencing tenants rights violations. These corporate management companies that own these homes take advantage of people. They take advantage of poor, black, brown, indigenous people every day and you allow them to. Having savings is wise and one of the reasons they exist is so that when folks are in a financial crisis, they have funds available to them in that moment to meet their needs and to give themselves breathing room to survive. That's what we should do with this upcoming budget. If we can create solutions to address these issues now, then we may be preventing further harm and need down the road. This will save lives. Take care of the people who fund this city with their tax dollars and don't abandon them when they need it most. If this was the police asking for these funds, the city would make it available to them. But they don't have to beg for this money because they already received the most funds out of any department in the city. Luke is next, followed by Ben Laughlin good afternoon council. My name is Luke. I am a resident of council district five. I also am here today opposing this budget and asking council to prioritize funding for our community. We're asking for three things. First of all, an increase of the number of water fountains at parks and outside city of Phoenix owned buildings and spaces. We would like an emergency eviction legal services program for people facing evictions and experiencing tenant rights violation. Thank you, council member Ansari for your leadership on that.

Luke is next, followed by Ben Laughlin good afternoon council. My name is Luke. I am a resident of council district five. I also am here today opposing this budget and asking council to prioritize funding for our community. We're asking for three things. First of all, an increase of the number of water fountains at parks and outside city of Phoenix owned buildings and spaces. We would like an emergency eviction legal services program for people facing evictions and experiencing tenant rights violation. Thank you, council member Ansari for your leadership on that. And then third, we'd like to increase the number of permanent supporting housing units for people who do not have housing and shelter. The city has $80 million extra this year. That is our money. While a rainy day fund sounds nice, this city has immediate emergency needs. This summer will be the hottest on record. How many people will die because we do not provide access to water or heat relief? We are in a housing crisis. More permanent and supportive housing is needed now. We are also in a predatory renting market. Landlords know they can take advantage of renters. We need more free legal counsel for folks that are facing eviction. This city gives the police a billion dollars every year, yet has the audacity to come back here and say that they can't find money to support people that are barely making it, people that are dying in the streets, people that are running out of water like the city continues to fund those positions while continuing to not prioritize people that need those services. Services three things. Increase the number of water fountains at parks and outside city of Phoenix owned buildings and spaces. Create an emergency eviction legal services program and increase the number of permanent supporting housing for folks. This is what we're asking for. Please prioritize the people of this city. Thank you. Ben is next. My name is Ben Loughlin, resident of District Seven, here today to speak in opposition to the trial budget. I spend a lot of time thinking about and trying to understand the city's budget, especially the police budget. And one thing I'm appreciating this year is that you showed us 21 positions that are funded by different departments. We're all working in service of the police. I didn't even know these particular positions existed. So I'm curious how much money is actually given to uphold and maintain the police department Phoenix each year, because on paper it's 979 million for this year. But these 21 positions are just another example of the way our taxpayer dollars are sucked into the black hole that is the police budget. Rather than being spent on resources, we actually need to be healthy and safe. Since 2018, Fuldarin action has talked to thousands of Phoenix residents about what those needed resources are. Last year, we provided y'all with copies of the Pueblos budget, which included nearly 70 investments. Folks primarily living in BiPoc and working class neighborhoods said they needed. Many of those things revolved around street, sidewalk and alley maintenance and cleanup. The money stolen from public works for those 20 positions needed to maintain the new police headquarters could have been funded from vacancies in the police department, freeing up the public works money to create 20 new positions that provide trash and recycling services. I understand that the idea behind setting aside the 80 million to protect services next year when we likely have a budget shortfall. But how will the community be guaranteed that that money won't just be used to protect and maintain the police budget this year? We need to see you fund cool working water fountains and parks in the public spaces to protect people from deadly heat. We need to see you create an emergency eviction legal services program to keep folks in their homes. And we need to see you increase the number of supportive housing units for unsheltered folks. All these things are more than possible at 80 million and will keep folks alive, which seems so basic that we shouldn't even have to ask you all to prioritize that. But here we are again asking you all to do it. Thank you. Thank you. That is all our registered comments for this item. This is just for information today, not for action. We will go to our next item. Councilwoman Pastor yes, I understand how the proposed budget was presented and that the 80 million be placed in amber. Can you tell me? Yes, yes, absolutely. Set aside. Set aside being proposed for the 80 million surplus. My question is, as we are hearing testimony, this is for information only, but we will be going to budget hearings and some of the needs that are not going away or that are going to continue. Is it possible to look at that and like water fountains, actual needs, not wants. Is it possible to then come back and look at the budget? I mean, I know anything's possible, but I know we're facing a shortfall next year and I don't know if that then becomes a different kind of conversation in order to help with our needs. Councilwoman pastor, mayor, members of the council, thank you for that question. The trial budget is a proposed budget by our city manager ahead of taking it to the community and to our residents for input. So is it possible that the proposed trial budget can change before we get to May when we present a city manager's proposed budget? The answer is yes. That's why we solicit community feedback. What I would say about the $80,000,000.01 time surplus is the reason why it's being proposed to be put in a set aside is because we do have a shortfall coming in 25 26. We have sustained ongoing revenue cuts from the state. So in an effort to make sure that we can balance the 25 26 budget, that is why it's proposed, to set that aside.

If any portion of that 80 million were to be taken and spent, particularly ongoing costs, that would be problematic as we don't have an ongoing revenue stream to offset that as it's modeled right now in our projections. So to answer your question, yes, there can be changes to the trial budget, but I want to just emphasize that if any of that 80 million is spent, that's less resources we have going into next fiscal year to develop the 25 26 budget. Okay. I understand that. And I understand it's kind of my household budget and where I'm going to look at the future, but yet I have needs today, and then I have to figure out what I'm going to do next in order to bring more revenue into the home. And that's either a second job or cut back somewhere else. So I understand the conversation and what we're discussing. My question is if we put some of that, if we take some of the 80 million s for the needs, then we would then have a totally different conversation as to how would we either generate more revenue or how we would cut. And I'm, and I think that's where you're trying to say to me, but I'll say it for myself. And I think that's really what then the conversation would be of the future council, one pastor, mayor, members of the council. That's correct. And as we stated on February 27. So when we bring back a new updated status next February for 25 26, if we have that 80 million that's carried forward as a set aside, if that is what the council approves through the budget adoption process, we'll factor that into our status. If any amount of that $80 million were to be approved by the city council to be spent on something, we'll also factor that in. And then we come back to the council next February with an updated status. That will be the time where we'll talk about solutions potentially for what we would need to do to balance the 25 26 budget, whether that's increasing revenue, it's cutting programs and services. It's a combination of the two. That's a discussion we would have at that time. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. We have any additional registered speakers? All right. Then we will go on to item three, which is Office of Accountability and Transparency. Ginger Spencer will present this item or introduce this item. I don't think you heard. There was one more. Or if you did, they're at the podium. Okay. I think there are. We'll take you first at the next budget hearing then. And we'll go on to item three. I get a list. I got a list. And she's not on it. I need our staff to tell me she was registered. Okay. Did you show staff. Will you show women next to you? The confirmation staff? Your confirmation or this item? Okay, go ahead for item one. Okay, thank you. No, that was difficult. Hello, council. My name is Andrea Lunas Cervantes. I'm a community organizer with unemployed Workers United, supporting Podera in Action's Pueblo's budget. I'm calling on the council to support and funding people and our communities with the $80 million surplus for 2024 2025 budget. Although you are being asked to put away all that surplus, I urge you to use funds to continue to address the housing crisis, especially as the state continues to kick the can down the road on solutions. Our fight for affordable and accessible housing is a crucial part of our take back our homes campaign. We launched the campaign to stop landlords from discriminating against renters in Phoenix and Tempe who rely on public assistance and ensure folks can have access to housing. Investing in our community by increasing access to water fountains and permanent supportive housing units for folks who are without shelter, as well as access to legal defense for tenants, experiencing evictions is of paramount importance. We should be investing our energy in making sure people survive our deadly summers and have housing shelter. We support the people's budget and demand that you add these three items to the trial budget because we believe it will allow our city to improve the quality of life of our communities that are often ignored. I hope everyone on this council directs this money to critical community resources. And thank you for your time. Thank you. We have identified the challenge you had registered for tomorrow's council meeting. Okay, item three. Ginger Spencer. Thank you, Mayor, Mayor Gallego, and members of the city council, we're here today to update you on proposed changes to chapter 20 of the Phoenix City Code that has to deal with the Office of Accountability and Transparency. Here with me today to give this presentation is our interim oat director, Shannon Yohani, as well as our city attorney, Julie Cree. Many already know our city attorney, Julie Cree. So I'd just like to take a moment to just share a little bit of information about Shannon, since this is her first meeting before city council.

Thank you, Mayor, Mayor Gallego, and members of the city council, we're here today to update you on proposed changes to chapter 20 of the Phoenix City Code that has to deal with the Office of Accountability and Transparency. Here with me today to give this presentation is our interim oat director, Shannon Yohani, as well as our city attorney, Julie Cree. Many already know our city attorney, Julie Cree. So I'd just like to take a moment to just share a little bit of information about Shannon, since this is her first meeting before city council. So Shannon joined the Office of Accountability and Transparency last September, where she serves as the general manager. Shannon is an attorney by trade, and before she joined the Office of Accountability and Transparency, she was the research director for ASU Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law for their center for justice. And then before that, she served for ten years with the city prosecutor's office. And while she was also in law school, she was a victim advocate, working with victims of domestic violence. So we're here today to talk about two areas. There we can we. There we go. All right. So the changes that we proposed for you today, mayor and council, are twofold. The first is to add language to establish a civilian review board. The civilian review board, or CRB, which we refer to, has always been envisioned by the mayor and council. The thought, though, was, is that we would focus on staffing up the office. And then we always knew that once the CRB was ready to come into fruition, that that would be something that would be driven by our mayor and council. And so today we stand with eleven of 15 positions filled, and we currently have recruitments ongoing. Also, the second part of the proposed changes that we have for you are basically so that we can bring chapter 20, the ordinance, into alignment with state law and our current practices. So we're also recommending to remove any language sets in the current ordinance that references oat conducting investigations or their involvement in the disciplinary process for the police department. And with that, it is my privilege to turn it over to Director Yohani. Thank you, Ginger. Good afternoon, mayor, members of council, and members of the public. Their proposed civilian review board carries forward the vision of this council and the mayor their 2021 plan for transparency and accountability for the Phoenix Police Department. It also gives vision in the sense of sight into the policies and procedures of the police department. This proposal also amplifies the voice for the community and those impacted by police misconduct, and also for the police department. It further creates value as an additional forum for the community and impacted individuals to have input, and it also creates value for the police department to hear directly from OAT, the members of the public, while also providing the department of forum to address, feedback and highlight its reform efforts. This allows additional opportunities for collaboration, trust building and establishing public accountability mechanisms, and it serves to meet constituent needs across the spectrum. The civilian Review board will start with implementation at section 2014. This will be a twelve member board, nine voting members appointed by the mayor, with three non voting members designated by the city manager and the police chief. Each member will serve a three year term with no more than two consecutive terms. Section 2015 establishes monthly meetings, a five member quorum requirement, as well as an attendance requirement. Section 2016 covers board duties and meetings, which shall include reviewing out reports and department responses, announcing findings, presentations by guest speakers, and public comment. Finally, 2017 details what the board will do. They will review completed OaT reports, which are the oatmeal monitoring reports on specific cases, and will ask whether or not the department's investigation is thorough and complete, and will provide any recommendations for future investigations, training, or policy. After reviewing both OAT's report as well as the department's response, the board will have the opportunity to provide the following five determinations. One is to adopt, two, adopt with revisions, three, decline. Four, decline with revisions, and five, request additional information to reach their findings. And with that, I turn it over to Julie Cree. Thank you. So, as mentioned, we will be aligning chapter 20, sections 21 to 2013 with current OAT practices and statute. Arizona revised statute 30 811 17. So we are going to remove language referencing Oat as conducting or participating in investigations, allegations, incidents, or inquiries against the Phoenix Police Department. We're also removing language referencing oats involvement in disciplinary actions and processes. Our next steps today, of course, we're here to get mayor and council feedback and also receive input from the community. Then we will revise as directed and update the ordinance into an ordinance format for approval by council. Before we do that, our normal practice is to take this to an ordinance review committee where we have different attorneys in the office and our city manager's office or other affected departments, along with Oat department, help review and finalize the ordinance. The final ordinance will be come back for adoption at a formal council meeting. I will turn it back over to Ginger. All right, thank you, Julie. So, Mayor and council, at this time, we would open it up for questions or feedback. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Robinson. Excuse me, mayor. Thank you very much. And Johanni. Welcome. Miss John.

So, Mayor and council, at this time, we would open it up for questions or feedback. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Robinson. Excuse me, mayor. Thank you very much. And Johanni. Welcome. Miss John. Sorry. Shannon, welcome. I've had an opportunity to speak with you several times. I think the work that you and your folks are doing is terrific. There is one thing I want to bring up. It's a section 2014, and it's on number four as we go through this whole process, and I assume this is the right time to bring the this up. We state in the city of Phoenix, police chief shall assign two administrative police advisory members, one from the police academy, the advanced training lieutenant, or its equivalent in the commander of the community relations within the police department. I look at that. It makes sense, I understand it. But what it also does, just for, just for further thought and probably better clarification, what it also does, it puts a person who could be represented by PPSLA, the police sergeants and lieutenants association in that process where we do not have representation from the Phoenix Law Enforcement association, from the officers union. So it's just, you know, it's something I want us to be aware of. It's something was flagged. I had a chance to discuss it a little bit earlier, and I think it's something we're going to need to work through, through. We need to figure that out, word it differently, do something about it, or ensure that the perception that PPSLA could have someone on that board, whereas plea would not. So that's something I wanted to make sure we are well aware of. And other than that, I know there might be a couple other things from some other folks. Like I said, I am really grateful for the work that all of you are doing. Pretty, it's important. I think my colleagues up here know I spent some time with the Department of Justice last week in DC, and I know this is on their radar. It's important. I know it's something the council promised to do well before I came on this council. But it's 2024. Times are changing and it's going to be important for us to meet the needs and make sure we're transparent, we're accountable. We're all the things that we strive to be as a law enforcement agency. So with that, Mayor, thank you very much for the time. And Shannon, again, welcome and congratulations. Thank you. Councilman Robinson. Thank you. Councilwoman O'Brien. Thank you. Mayor. I would like to go to page seven of the ordinance and section 28, number 2d says making prospective recommendations regarding conduct of future investigations and the appropriate disciplinary sanctions in future investigations. Can you explain to me what that last part is, the appropriate disciplinary sanctions in future investigations and how that would impact our officers, mayor and Councilman O'Brien and members of the council, city council? Basically what oat can do is monitor cases. And then when they do the monitoring report, they're looking to see if the police department's investigation was thorough and complete. In addition, they're able to make recommendations regarding future investigations policy or training. So in regards to appropriate disciplinary sanctions and future investigations, what we've seen is when we're reviewing reports, perhaps the operations order for the police department is very specific on what the discipline should be. But when it actually comes out, the police chief maybe do something different than what is stated in the operations order. And so perhaps if we see that difference there, that is something that we would note that they would, the police chief would stick to the, what's laid out in the operations order. Whenever we do our monitoring report, the police chief will have 30 days to respond to it. And so if he did give something that's different than what is stated in the operations order, then he would be able to address that in his response to the Office of accountability and Transparency. In addition, if the civilian review board is put into place. The item will not be heard until once we have the monitoring report as well as the response from the police chief so that the CRB is getting that information at the same time. So I hope that answers your question. I guess what I want to ensure then, is that this recommendation, could it, or I guess find out, is could it adversely impact an officer who went through the investigation process? Mayor, Councilman O'Brien, and members of the council? No, it would not. We cannot have any influence on the actual investigation that we are monitoring. We cannot influence the chief's decision nor the discipline or that actual investigation. And can, I think maybe, Julie, can you help us with the difference between monitoring and review? Yes, mayor, members of council. Council member O'Brien. So the legal definitions are between monitor and review. They can be interpreted differently, but in practice, the way the OAT is running their office, there is no real difference between monitoring and review.

I guess what I want to ensure then, is that this recommendation, could it, or I guess find out, is could it adversely impact an officer who went through the investigation process? Mayor, Councilman O'Brien, and members of the council? No, it would not. We cannot have any influence on the actual investigation that we are monitoring. We cannot influence the chief's decision nor the discipline or that actual investigation. And can, I think maybe, Julie, can you help us with the difference between monitoring and review? Yes, mayor, members of council. Council member O'Brien. So the legal definitions are between monitor and review. They can be interpreted differently, but in practice, the way the OAT is running their office, there is no real difference between monitoring and review. So the way the OAT is performing their review is in compliance with state law. Okay. Thank you very much for that. And I apologize because I don't, I did not write the page this is on, but it talks about folks from oat being able to attend interviews. What I want to understand is if they're attending an interview, what exactly does that mean? What is their role? Councilwoman O'Brien? Mayor, members of council, the Oat staff person who would be attending an interview would simply be there as an observer. They're not participating in the interview. They're not asking any questions. They're not giving any feedback. It would just be to be listening in real time to the interview that's being conducted. Okay. So not asking any questions, not providing any feedback, not really making any, and not making any recommendations based on answers they hear related to the investigation. That is correct. That direct maybe to the investigation process afterwards. Is that why would they attend the interview? To listen in real time, and then it would feed in, potentially, to the monitoring report later about interview techniques, maybe questions asked, but it wouldn't have any impact on the current investigation. It would be for a future prospective investigations to say, in future investigations, we recommend you ask these types of questions in these types of areas. Okay. So I'm not sure if maybe we might want to look to ensure in that paragraph that it is clear that they can watch and cannot participate in any way, shape, or form. I mean, I know that's what the statute says, but it might provide some clarity for others who are reading it and maybe a little bit of peace of mind. So thank you for that. And then I want to see and then I looked at the section 2014 relative to how the civilian review board was to be established. And while I do not believe that this would happen under our current mayor, I am concerned about the mayor having the ability to appoint all the members, and so would like to recommend we consider having each council person, as well as the mayor, appoint a person to the civilian review board, but then that it must be approved with a super majority vote that out there for my colleagues to think about. And then I believe this will be my last one to 15 talks about review board duties. An item section 2016 C four, it says, presentations by guest speakers, invited by the board and approved by the oat director. And so I'm a little bit concerned about if only one side is being invited or not. We're not hearing, you know, some folks get left out what would be an appeals process or if someone wanted to get in front of the board. Right? I don't so have any ideas about that. Mayor, Councilman O'Brien and members of the council. One way to address that would basically to be added that presentation by guest speakers, invited by the board, and approved by the oat director and the police police chief, so that way we can have both sides represented. Wonderful. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thank you, mayor. Thank you. We'll go to Councilman Stark and then Councilman Hodge. Washington, then councilwoman. Pastor, thank you. Can you speak a little bit about how the board would act together to make recommendations on issues like training or practices, best practices? I'm trying to better understand, you know, what a discussion would entail and then what would come out of it. Mayor, Vice mayor Stark and members of the council. So as we stated earlier, the way that this would work is the Oat department looks to see if the police investigation was thorough and complete. And so overall, they'll say, yes, they believe the police investigation was thorough and complete, or, no, it was not thorough and complete. And so they also may give recommendations, as you stated, in regards to training. And so they look at each specific allegation. They look to see if the police department said it was sustained or unfounded, and then they will also make specific recommendations. So when the CRB is hearing these cases, and they'll also hear the other side as well, they can basically say they can adopt oats recommendations. They can say, yes, we believe this report was thorough and complete. And if there were five recommendations and some of them had to deal with training, they could say yes, and we agree with that as well. They could say, we agree that it was overall, thorough and complete. But then they can disagree with some of the recommendations or they can ask for additional recommendations, and likewise they can do the same thing with declining it. If there's not enough information, though, to satisfy them getting to a decision on that item, then they could also always ask for additional information. And Vice Mayor Stark, another thing we're doing is myself and staff, we're actually looking at CRB meetings and proceedings that are currently taking place to see how those are operating as well. Okay. So you are looking at what other communities are doing, and if you are reviewing an issue, you would also be able to reach out to, let's say another city that's been this had a review board for a number of years and kind of ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Municipality and OAT Department", "insights": [{"observation": "So the way the OAT is performing their review is in compliance with state law.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The OAT staff person who would be attending an interview would simply be there as an observer.

I mean, it's so new for us. I just want to make sure we do it properly and we do it thoroughly and that we really are invested in doing it correctly. Mayor, vice Mayor Stark and council members. Yes, we are definitely going to do that. Did research on 15 cities, and now what we're doing is looking to see which videos we can see online and then also the follow up as well. So like, for example, Columbus, they have their CRB's available online. And so I was watching that and as I was watching it, I saw some questions, and I was like, we need to go ahead and follow up with the staff to address some of the questions that we're seeing so that we're well prepared when we have our CRBM place. So thank you, Vice mayor, for that. Great. Thank you. And I just want to make sure we do it right and that we're serving everybody by doing it right. And, you know, I, at this point, I might be open to looking at recommendations for everyone, but I would agree that we need some kind of super majority. And I still think that maybe the mayor should have the ability to have more than one appointment. But I'm, you know, very open to looking at a hybrid. But I do think it's time that we get something on the books that is consistent with state law. And so I will be supportive. And again, I'm still open to discussions about the, how the board will look like. Thank you. Thank you, mayor. Thank you. Councilwoman Hodge Washington, followed by Councilwoman pastor. Thank you, mayor. My question was actually asked by the vice mayor, so I will yield my time back. Councilwoman Pastor yes. My question and my understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that there have been several reports placed on oat on the website of Oat, and there have been several reports in the sense of monitoring and so I want to go to the item that Councilwoman O'Brien has spoken, page seven or page 99, and item d, making prospective recommendations regarding conduct of future investigation and appropriate disciplinary sanctions and future investigations. I believe one of those reports came back and said, we would recommend that they follow the operations order. And in that report, in the operations order, I'm just going to make up a day, a number. It required five days of suspension, but what was given was less than the five days of suspension. And so the recommendation was, you need to follow the operations of order. And I made up the number, but that's the concept. Am I wrong? Am I right? Councilwoman, pastor, mayor, members of council, you are correct. Okay. And so I think that's why it's very important, because some of these aspects have already been placed or been operating in these reports. And I think that's that report, how we're, what we're speaking about is answering number D because it's already been in operation. Okay. Now the other piece is in, and I agree also with monitoring and review. I think that really needs to be defined if we're going to use it simultaneously. I mean, as the same, then that really needs to define. Review means monitoring. Monitoring means review. Because really, then different definitions or how I read it or interpret it may be different than others. So I think that needs to be clearly defined as when it goes in the interviews, in the CRB, my understanding is that's operation. I mean, observing, not operation, observing that really. It's observing at that moment, in real time, what is happening and being able to see and understand and get context of what happened in that interview. It's purely observation. I sometimes believe that's also observation. I may look at something very differently because of my experience than someone else sitting next to me as I'm observing something in front of me. So I wanted to clear that up, and I wanted to use the term observation because I think that's what the intent is in providing, really, recommendations. I do believe that there was another one, that, another report that there was some recommendations as to what they observed in the interviewing, as to a. I don't know what the term to use is, but one of the persons that was being interviewed was claiming that it was racially, they were being racially profiled. And in that process, nowhere in the investigation was it ever said, were you racially profiling this person. And so I believe that one of those recommendations that came out is when you're investigating or interviewing, it would probably, we would recommend that you would ask if this being, if this is being claimed or be part of the standard investigation at the beginning to ask these questions. Okay. Council, Wimpastor, mayor, members of council. Yes, that is correct. One of the recommendations in that report was that the department, when they are conducting these investigations, that they ask questions regarding every allegation that is put in front of them.

So in that particular case, there was an allegation of racial bias, and in reviewing the interviews, there were no questions asked specifically about that. And the investigator only reviewed the body worn camera and then reached a conclusion and found that that allegation was unfounded. And so Oates recommendation was that to really reach that claim, that the investigation needs to actually explore that allegation by asking the officer those questions. Thank you. I just want to place on the record that when we were a collective, was developing the Office of accountability and Transparency. A lot of effort went into, and a lot of research and a lot of best practices went into oat. And the intentionality was really for accountability and transparency, not only for the community, but also for the department to be able then the department to be able to defend themselves and be able to show that what was being claimed was not happening, or if the community was saying, this is what was happening, and they'd be able to have the evidence and everything, they had a space in place to. To be able to voice that and be able to look at an investigation or look at an issue. So it was meant, really, for both sides to have a space, a safe space of those being able to observe what was happening and make intended or conscious changes with actual evidence. And so that's really why oat was created. It was a push pull me to get to where we were and to get oat, but it got to where it needed to be. The next step was a civilian review. And in the civilian review, we really wanted to have a voice, a council voice, as to who is placed on the civilian review. So my recommendation is that I agree with Councilwoman O'Brien that we should have a voice of who sits on the civilian review. I'm not sure about the super majority. I may be able to get there, but I would like it to operate or process. Why be very similar to ethics as to people apply. And then there were different stages in the ethics process, and then the council interviewed at the final and be able then to, as a collective, along with the mayor, to be able then to select those that were going to be on the ethics committee. So I'm in favor of that. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Hodge. Washington. Thank you, mayor, for giving me an opportunity. I did have one concern or question that's not directly related to the, the civilian review board, but one of the issues that we often hear individuals come to the mic or speak about, it deals with the handling of their, after there's been an officer involved incident. It's kind of the communication piece. I would ask that, if possible, that look into some form of best practices of how we can better communicate with our community when there is such an incidence, because I think sometimes that creates more harm or injuries to the individuals and their family members, then I think it's necessary. So I would definitely just ask that we add some level of review or best practices on how best to deal with individuals that have been impacted. And I think that goes in line with section 20 Hyphen one C where oath is to provide support services to impacted community members. Mayor Councilman Hodge, Washington and council members, that is definitely something that we could look into. One thing I would like to highlight is we do have advocates, family advocates who are available in the city's family advocacy center, and that's where those positions were created to work with those families. But we would be happy to work with the police chief and the FAC human services department to see how we can better coordinate. And just to be clear, I am aware that we do have those services, but I think sometimes it doesn't appear that our community is aware of that, similar to how we have the tenant emergency assistance program, it does not seem like everyone is aware of those. So I think we probably, I'm just saying maybe we look at better practices and include in communication pieces as well. So I just wanted to point that out. Thank you, Councilman Hodgewashington. And definitely we can incorporate that into the training that we do with the community as well to make sure they're aware of it. Thank you so much. Thank you. Establishing a civilian review board is the next step in our ongoing process to modernize and strengthen our police department and its functions. It will add another layer of community conversation and accountability. We hope it will build trust between residents and those serving our community in uniform. As our deputy city manager mentioned, the plan has been to staff oat so that it could support the board and then create the board. We now have eleven individuals working at the Office of Accountability and Transparency, so we have a good team to support the board's work. One of the things we haven't talked a lot about, but that seems to be a growing issue in our community is the use of technology.

One thing I noted in the OAT ordinance, it says assist with mediation. And I think the council was very clear we meant lead mediation. So that's one area where I hope we can just clarify that. And we have. We have someone hired already in that position, so we are in a good position there. We are making changes to comport with state legislation. There was legislation the city did not support, but we understand that it passed and was signed by Governor Ducey. And so some of these changes are not changes wanted or expected, but we are making them nonetheless. Also want to say, sometimes when we create a new board, we have more specific directions about partial terms so that not everyone expires. And there's a one line reference, but we might add a little bit more detail there just so that we can sort of have a startup process for the board and not everyone with as much staggered end of terms as possible for some continuity, but also allowing new folks to come on over time. Any comments before we go to citizen? All right, we will begin with Luke Black, followed by Jose Hernandez. Once again, Luke Black, resident of District five. Y'all knew we were coming today. I just want to take us back to 2018, the most violent year on record. At that point, for Phoenix police, they would go on to be the most violent department in the country three more times since then. What we wanted was for them to stop killing us. We wanted some measure of independent accountability. And what we've gotten has been more police violence. We've gotten the largest DOJ investigation in history. We've gotten a bloated black hole, billion dollar budget, and we've got six years of this city letting this mayor do everything that she can to shield the violence of this department from accountability. These changes to oat strip even the facade of accountability. Only allowing oat to get involved after the police do their investigation makes oat almost useless. Putting all the power into the mayor's hands to select the civilian review board makes oat a tool of the mayor's agenda and not a tool to protect Phoenix residents from the police that y'all keep funding. Please hear me. Your efforts to stop justice will not stop us. Stripping out of all of its power will not stop us. We will keep coming for this department. We will be safe. Hear that again? We will be safe. And the police and this council will be held accountable. Thank you. Jose is next, followed by Maria Sanchez. Hello. I'm Jose Hernandez, resident of District seven. And I brought my beautiful mother here. We're both victims of police violence. Our little brother was killed. That's why I'm here today. And I love how Luke is talking about how Ode is being stripped. Right? But let's talk about how we got here. Right? 2019, 2020. Hundreds of us mobilized. We began to show up to council meetings and we wanted to ensure that the model of civilian oversight that was going to get implemented in Phoenix was independent, investigative, transparent and accountable. That was successful for a moment. But I want to make sure we don't forget one vote by a council member was made for oak, not because of genuine support, but because voting against it would look bad. Support, political moves. And the voting record after concerning oat shows as much. So now we go to July. It's a history lesson. We go to July 2022. Former cop, state rep and police cheerleader John Kavanaugh. Police union backed, of course, introduced HB 2721 to weaken oat by requiring those investigating police misconduct to have at least two thirds of its members consist of certified law enforcement personnel. Go figure, right? Obviously, it was more of the. We investigated ourselves and we found we did nothing wrong. Blueprint that led to PPD being coming one of the deadliest police departments in the country time and time again. Right? And now what? It finds itself under the thumb of the DOJ this year, Roger Smith opted to resign from his role as director of. In his resignation, he cited recent events which led him to believe that the Office of Accountability and Transparency, it's hard saying that word here, because it doesn't exist, did not have the independence needed to provide civilian oversight of the Phoenix Police Department. Those are his words. The city is also now finding itself facing another lawsuit, this time from the attorney who was supposed to be hired by former Director Smith. This is thanks to the internal meddling. So here we are. We're here to strip the powers of both. Again, this isn't what we fought for. And something is not better than nothing.

Thank you, Maria Sanchez, followed by Rebecca Denis. Maria Sanchez, Phoenix resident, District three and I am here to remind someone sitting there in the middle that the reason that this committee was formed, this O office was formed, is because we could not trust police to investigate themselves. We have seen what they're doing right now with the PR run, with the DOJ investigation. We know that they're saying that they can reform themselves, that they're doing all they can. And what we're seeing is more violence. We cannot trust the police to actually be doing any investigations. And what we're actually seeing as a calculated decision for someone that's sitting up there who didn't even want to vote for this, but they did it for a calculated political move. And what you're doing now is just wasting $3 million of our budget because you're going to dismantle any usefulness of the civilian oversight office. And this office is just going to work like the PSB office, right? Like, just internal investigations. So you're wasting our budget, you're wasting our time, you're wasting our resources. This is an election year, and I want to remind you that as you're going to do your runs, that you're actually not solving any of the safety concerns issues that we have. Rebecca is next, followed by VD Hernandez. I'm Rebecca Denis, resident of District Seven. I'm opposed to the proposed amendments to oat, specifically to the current city code, section 26.8, that would further eliminate and strip this office of power. It's already lacking in power. It has really no real power to hold Phoenix PD accountable if the council makes this proposed change to the city code. What may appear as simple in language is actually stripping the ability for oat to provide any type of impactful monitoring of Phoenix PD. I'm appalled at what the makeup of the civilian review board would be. When you google the definition of the word civilian, the definition that comes up is a person not in the armed surface or the police force. Why do we have police on a civilian review board? Why is that part of this proposal? That's wild. I'm just really going to go off script because I feel like everyone else is going to say what I have to say when people wonder why people become radicalized. I didn't wake up one day saying, abolish the police. I didn't wake up one day just being fearful of the police. It happened because I witnessed police violence, because my family experienced racial profiling, because I saw people being killed that looked like me, that looked like my siblings, that looked like my dad, and because when I started to participate in the avenues that you tell us are the ways to get to reform, nothing happens. Nothing changes. We go to. We do something here, the state preempts it. We show up, we sit in these city council meetings, we tell you our stories, we cry in front of you, we come. Reform doesn't work, and you prove it every single year that we come here, over and over and over, begging for policy changes. Sitting with your police chief. I've been in meetings with your police chief. I've been in meetings with upper people, upper management in Phoenix PD. And sometimes they show up to those meetings and are like, I don't even know why I'm here, basically, or I don't have the information that we promised that we would have here. So want to know why people become radicalized? Why we say abolish the police? Why? I don't believe the police will ever be the answer. It's because of your inability action and because you guys never do what you say you're going to do. And I don't trust the mayor. I don't trust this council. And how dare you think that you can appoint nine voting members to a civilian review board. Vd Hernandez is next, followed by Senator Hernandez. When this policy was passed and this room was full with over 300 people asking for transparency, accountability, investigative body. And that's what was passed at this point. This is not that. And so what we will tell the council is at this point, what has become is this is trash, this proposal. And not, you know, I'm sorry, not about the staff and like the work y'all have done, but because we know that this is political direction as well. Right. And what we have. Right. Nine people to be appointed by a mayor that has, under your leadership, mayor. 239 people have been shot. 165 people have been killed. A council that does not understand race and racial disparities. That I am so glad, council members, that some of your districts are safe and that people don't experience this level of violence. But our communities and our neighborhoods are not the same. And we experience racialized violence in a different way. We're having this proposal and we have plea. As member Robinson shared PPSLA and pLea, two unions that actively supported SB 1070 actively sat behind Governor Brewer at that time and signed the most anti immigrant law we had seen. That's who's represented in this board. Not families, not survivors of police violence, not victims.

There is no accountability in this process. There is no transparency in this process. This money should just get added to the general funds because at this point, it's a waste of our resources. If we move in this direction, that does nothing. And I'll just add that this was advocacy from the council to strip this at the state legislature. Legislature. Senator Hernandez, followed by Ben, for the record, Anna Hernandez, resident of District seven. I'm glad I was able to join today just to share a few thoughts. Sorry, I might be a little. I don't want to drop this microphone. I'll wait for my mic drop at the end. But no, I appreciate the discussion here. And as we all know, that the progress that was made in this chamber back in February 2020 ultimately was undermined by police unions at the state legislature. Right. They advocated, they moved, and they organized, and they took a bill to a state legislator that ran that bill, got the votes, passed it, and undermined all the work that happened here. Completely aware of that. But for us to further strip any power from that, I think it's a mistake. It's a misstep. If we are really trying to get to a point that we can say that we are wanting to function in a transparent and accountable manner here at the city, especially around the police department, the reality is that the police unions organize and mobilize very quickly, just this session. They've also advocated to not give victims of sexual violence reports within 14 days. They were okay with the reporting. They just weren't okay with the 14 day window. And so something as small as that shows me that there will never be good faith on part of the law enforcement unions to really get us to a place of accountability and transparency. Also, I think that it is very undemocratic to have the mayor, the sole appointer of a nine member board. I do agree with councilmember O'Brien and councilmember pastor that every council district should have a say in that. I also am a little worried and have concerns around the supermajority piece. But I think for the overall democratic process that I think we all support, say we support and engage in that it would only be equitable and fair to have that spread out within the council so that every single district and the entirety of the people of Arizona are properly represented by those that they elected into office. Thank you. Ben is next, followed by Katherine Bowman. Thanks. This is Ben Loughlin again from district seven. I just want to start out by saying that the policy that was passed to establish vote was never the vision of the majority of this council or the mayor in 2019. I, along with 15 or so other BIPOC working class and our queer folks, spent literally hundreds of hours doing research and drafting the policy that would lead to the creation of oat. It wasn't y'all's vision. So let's be clear about that. At some point in that process. In 2019, we jokingly suggested the name oat for this future office because oats are soft and squishy, and that's a terrible way for police accountability to be. That name unfortunately, stuck. But even worse, that's what civilian oversight in Phoenix has become. Over the past four years, I've watched a handful of y'all, and one person in particular, do everything in their power to undermine and destroy everything civilian oversight in Phoenix was supposed to be and to protect this police department at all costs. When hundreds of community members mobilized to support the creation of civilian oversight, we were clear and vocal about the fact that it must be four independent, investigative, transparent, and accountable. We were clear with y'all that if it wasn't all four of those things, it shouldn't be implemented at all. Civilian oversight isn't a situation where something is better than nothing. And if y'all approve these changes to civilian oversight as they're proposed and the ones y'all are talking about since this meeting started, you will have created something significantly more harmful than having nothing. But I think for some of y'all, that's always been the goal. So it makes sense. Hearing y'all advocate to make sure there's equal sides on this is wild and so insulting and makes so clear that most of y'all are trying to shake this to be directly in service of the police unions. One of y'all even said today that these changes are about strengthening the police department. The police department already has everything they need to protect themselves. People have nothing. I'm not sure if you're trying to rush these changes through as a part of the PR campaign for the police department or because you're scared of the change that's coming to the makeup of this council, but you're putting politics before people's safety and well being at this point. Oat should just be dismantled. Thank you. Katherine is our final speaker. Has my mic been unmuted or do I do that? Sorry. We can hear you.

Oat should just be dismantled. Thank you. Katherine is our final speaker. Has my mic been unmuted or do I do that? Sorry. We can hear you. Okay. Thank you, mayor, vice mayor and council. I live in East Mesa. My name is Kathy Bowman, and my family and I take every advantage as we. That we can to go down to Phoenix to enjoy, you know, the suns, the diamondbacks, the cultural activities. We are really supportive of the fact that the Phoenix Police Department is there attempting to manage whatever public safety issues come up in large cities. But it is also so important that there's a focus on ethical and law based policing. And it pains me to hear the people in your community speak today about how they view their police department. I personally had an instance where my brother in law passed away after being in Sheriff Arpaio's jail and going through alcohol withdrawal. I know how terrible this is for people, but my comments today go to the changes that are being attempted in title 20 because the civilian Review Board cannot operate unless the council takes the time to determine whether or not the prohibitions on certain people working for oat that are in section 25 D reflect council's intent. I don't know if the council has seen the latest job posting for monitor, but it talks about people being prohibited from working for oat if they or their immediate family members, which includes step parents, stepbrothers, step sisters that they may not have ever even met, that if any of those people volunteered for law enforcement, they are precluded. That means that if somebody was a military police officer, based on the language that is in the job description, if their relative was in that position, they could not work at oat. I don't think that's what you intended. And when you crack this ordinance open, you should take time to make sure that section 25 D reflects your intent. Thank you. That is all of our public comment. Councilmember comments councilwoman pastor I have a comment, and it goes around out because there were good intentions in creating oat, and good intention was to make sure that there was an investigative component and that got changed and pulled under us as the legislation came about. So what I heard from the community, because this is really community driven, and this is something that has been in decades of many families of the past trying to get to where oat was when we voted for it. I'm not sure about it today. And within the community, we had a push pull me in the sense of if it's not investigated, then oats not worth it, just don't do oat. And that's what I'm hearing right now. So my question to you, and I'm sorry, I'm going to put you on the spot, but my question to you, how does it stay transparent and holding accountability? Because that's what I'm hearing from the community, that oat is not that. Councilwoman, pastor and mayor, members of council, I do hear what the community's concerns are. I do believe Oat continues to contribute value both to the city, the community, and to the department. I understand, and I want to make the distinction that the value for the department is not to give them a forum to tout their reform efforts, but to create a public forum in response to Oats reports for the department to be able to respond to Oats recommendations and speak to whether or not they're adopting those recommendations, those specific recommendations, and how they're implementing them. And the department would be able to return to those continual civilian review board meetings to attest to. For example, at the board hearing we held in January, Oat brought forth the following recommendations. What's the department's progress on making those recommendations? Reality. And so that's where that value is. I absolutely understand the frustration from the community that this is not the board and this is not the agency that they expected when this was created in 2020 and implemented in 2021. But that's not the, that's not the result of this council. That's the result of the state law. And so oats practice currently was reduced because of that state law. But we're. We are doing everything to be as robust as we can within the confines of the state law and the review process. The monitor process is absolutely valuable, as you'll see in the first two reports that we published. We have fundamental recommendations that will shape these misconduct investigations and will help assure that the members of the public can see that these investigations regarding misconduct against them as community members are actually being thoroughly investigated or actually being thoroughly considered. And so that when there are findings, whether they're sustained or they're not sustained, those findings will be. Have been based on a sound investigation, not an investigation that has holes or questions not asked or evidence not considered.

We are doing everything to be as robust as we can within the confines of the state law and the review process. The monitor process is absolutely valuable, as you'll see in the first two reports that we published. We have fundamental recommendations that will shape these misconduct investigations and will help assure that the members of the public can see that these investigations regarding misconduct against them as community members are actually being thoroughly investigated or actually being thoroughly considered. And so that when there are findings, whether they're sustained or they're not sustained, those findings will be. Have been based on a sound investigation, not an investigation that has holes or questions not asked or evidence not considered. So I do believe continues to absolutely have value for the city, absolutely have value for the community. Then I'm going to follow up with that. Thank you, mayor. How will those recommendations then be implemented? They're just recommendations. It's up to the chief. That's correct. And so I'm. I'm gonna be a community member at this moment, which I am, and say, well, it's up to the chief. This chief may today do it, but when there's a new chief, the chief, the chief may not listen to the community. And so this is where I struggle about oat and where the future of oat will be, go, or even exist. And so how do you respond back to the community, or how do you respond to my question, councilwoman, pastor, and mayor, members of council? The reality is that accountability can't restrict solely with OaT. OAT is a mechanism to create accountability and transparency within the police department. But Oat cannot be the sole voice that's asking for that accountability and transparency. I believe that it will continue to be a circumstance where both the members of the public and OAT, if they're calling for changes and they're calling for reform, and those things aren't happening, then that would be, that would then come to other members of leadership within the city, including council and the mayor, to also advocate and voice that desire for accountability and transparency. And if it's not happening, then those would be decisions that are outside the scope of Oat, of what happens when that accountability is not happening, as suggested by the board and the public and by OaT. The other piece is independent. How do you describe independent? How is oat independent? OAt is independent in that we conduct our reports completely in house. I know in reference to some previous things that were mentioned in terms of the independence of the office. Granted, I've been in this position for a limited period of time, not at the length of time that Mister Smith was in the role. I have not experienced the limitations on oats independence that Mister Smith voiced. I also was not in the room, so I can't share whether or not that was a common experience on either side. I was not present for those conversations. In my experience and in my practice, there has been independence. I have not received any demands or requests to edit any of the content or substance of our reports, either our annual reports, our quarterly reports, nor our monitoring reports. The edits that were done on the two reports that were released were done by me and the monitoring supervisor who wrote those reports. And those were just for purposes of clarity and consistency and to make sure that the tone and professionalism of the reports reflected the tone and professionalism of. Of the staff at oat. Okay, so I'm just going to break it down. The previous person that sat in your seat, there were several things that went on. And the conversations that I've had is oat was designed to be independent. Oat was designed to report to the city manager, and it would be under the city manager's purview or section department. But independents, we had to. Had to draw a line that way because they would be a city employee. And I understand the whole concept of being a city employee, but a city employee with independence, to be able then to do what they need to do a note and thoroughly do what they have to do, and write the reports. That's how I define independence, that people are not meddling, or I probably shouldn't use the term meddling, but people not, you know, reading the report for clarity, reading the report report for definitely justice and what's going to be then published, and it's correct, and give that clarity, but not to be able to go in and change, maybe a word or misspelling or something, but not to change the content of what is being delivered. And I want to know, as I sit here, because I was one, along with others on this dais, that worked really hard and crafted what Oat should be, and I want to know that it's going to be independent. Councilwoman, pastor, mayor, members of council, I can assure you that as long as I am in this role, that will be the reality for Oat. We have not had any. Any content edited in any of the reports, as I indicated. And for those that have read the reports, I think it's quite clear that those reports do say things that are very critical of the department in those particular investigations. And so I think it would be tough to read those reports and see that they. And come to the conclusion that they've been edited for content or edited to soften what Oates opinions were. Oates conclusions were. And so, no, I can assure that none of that has been edited for content. Any edits that were made that didn't come from Oat specifically or Oat staff were spelling errors or things that just didn't make sense on a read. And so nothing related to content was changed. Okay. And then my second final, we're all gonna change. I won't be sitting in here in three years. You may not be sitting here in ten years. Everybody at that table won't be sitting here for ill change.

But I want to make sure before I leave that oat and what we crafted and the intention of it is pure, and it operates that way, regardless if you're sitting in your seat or if I'm sitting in, that it stands and withholds what other weather comes its way, that it's able to do what it's supposed to do. And so I'm still very, very leery at this moment in the sense of which way to go. And what I mean is, because I hear the community saying, it's not what we. What. It's not what you wrote, and it's not what we expected that it is today. And so I. Me being the one that doesn't trust much, I'm putting faith into making sure that it's independent, at least transparent, and people will be held accountable. Councilwoman, pastor, mayor, members of council, we have policies and practices in place that we are ensuring that those issues of independence and accountability and transparency, not only within oat, but also in what we release publicly, are in place. This work and this office. I understand it's been two years, but in the grand scheme of government. That's a relatively short period of time. So we're still working through a lot of those things. We're working through a lot of those changes in implementation. There's still a lot that Oat has yet to do. But I do 100% believe that OaT does have the capacity to be independent and to issue those reports and to give robust and critical feedback to the department so that those improvements can be made. And the department, in my experience thus far, has been receptive to those suggestions and those recommendations we've made. So. But part of it is bringing everybody to the table to engage in those conversations. And the way that we do that is we continue to have community input and community engagement so that we can continue to build those practices and build those policies to meet the needs of the community. But I can say that what we're doing and the processes that we're developing are both to ensure that the work of oat gets to the public and has value, but also to make sure that it's done in independently. Thank you, Councilwoman Guardado. Thank you, mayor. So, Shannon, I think you're gonna have your work cut out for you. I think that when we voted for this in 2020, it's very different from what we are seeing today. So to the community who fought for this, to the community that was here, to those 300 people that were here in the room saying, we need an office of accountability and transparency, I guess today, the only thing I can really say is, I'm sorry that this is not what you guys thought it was going to be. It's not what I thought it was going to be. I know that it's not staff fault. I want to thank Ginger and Lori and everyone and Chief Sullivan and everyone that has done all. All the work to try to make this work. You know, we can continue to hide, you know, behind the state, but we know why things are happening the way they are happening today. I am very disappointed. I. You know, I think that we should probably find a new name. I get it, Shannon, that you are going to try your best to continue to submit those reports, and then you'll continue to talk to the community. But until we don't have the community in those rooms and working together with everyone, not exactly sure what this is going to do, I think it's just going to be another check mark to say that we did it and that it's there, but hoping to work closely together with you to try and making sure that the voices of the community are being heard. I know Chief Sullivan has done a lot of good things since he's been here. Chief Elmore, thank you so much as well, for all of your hard work as well. I think we're all trying to come together, but this is not it. This is not what we thought we were going to have for the community, to making sure that people's voices were going to be heard. Thank you, mayor. Thank you. Any additional comments I want to make additional. Councilwoman, pastor, SB 1070, take us back there. As the gentleman took me back, and it took ten years to really. It took ten years of a community voice that rallied and rallied and rallied around SB 1070.

I will be servicing a spanish interpreter for today's economic development and housing subcommittee session. I will now take a moment to introduce myself to our spanish speaking audience and review some guidelines. Buenos dias. Bienvenidos per levite. Gracias. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Mister Chairman. Thank you, Alsi. Really appreciate it. Okay, before we get started today, I want to take a moment to congratulate my peer partner in crime of sorts. Today will be Councilwoman Ansari's last subcommittee meeting as she prepares for her run for congress. So, Councilwoman, do you have any remarks that you'd like to make today? Sure. Thank you, Chairman Robinson. I really, really appreciate it. I think with every passing day, it continues to feel extremely bittersweet to say goodbye to city council. I think that the work that this subcommittee in particular does on housing to opioid response to education and the arts, this is some of the most impactful work. And I think our entire council has done a phenomenal job making progress for our city. And honestly, as I knock doors in the district, this is the type of work that residents are most excited and encouraged to hear that we are doing. Our thoughtful response to homeless solutions, how we're dealing with rising issues with fentanyl and our prevention programs and our Narcan programs, and our forward looking vision for the city of Phoenix. So it's been a huge honor for me to serve, and I'm really going to miss you all. And it's really been a pleasure. Thank you. Thank you. And it's been a pleasure working with you, and we wish you all the best. So thank you. Now, with that, we start the subcommittee meeting with a call to the public. I have three folks on the list, virtual, for a call to the public. We will start with Misha Fish. Can you hear us on, but not connected with audio. We'll give her a chance to. Can we go to the next one? We'll go to Nancy Palmer. Nancy, can you hear us? Yes, I can hear you. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Hi. I live in surprise, but I believe right to counsel is extremely important because we have a management company involved in a pyramid screen pyramid scheme. And also the owner of this property, they have it listed as a primary residence, but they're writing it out to us. We got this house through a program from Home, Inc. And a new leaf. They raised our rent 394%. From one month to the next, they are kicking us out of our home. If it wasn't for right to counsel from Cl's, we would be out on the street already. But now we have until May 5 05:00 p.m. to go into the street. We have nowhere to go. We need right to counsel. We need tenants to have a voice because all the judge hears. Nancy, I'm sorry. Yes, sir. The tenant owes money and that it is owed to the landlord. That's all the judge hears, okay? That's all they know. And all the judge says is pay them the money and get out in seven days. Nancy. That's a fact. And it's happening. It happens. Thousands of people a month are going homeless, including my family. Nancy, I am very sorry for your plight, and I understand they have $40,000 of my money. Nancy, if you give me a quick second, you're speaking to an item that's coming up, item seven. This is a part to the call to the public. That would be not an ident. You know, something that's already on the agenda. And what we can do is give you the time when we get to that issue. So do you mind if we get back with you during that time? Or I can give you the time now. I will wait. Thank you, sir, for listening. Thank you. Next is Michelle Ashton. And Michelle, she's not on.

We'll move to our next item. Moving along. Item five is an update on the city's opioid response and results of the opioid planning environmental scan. And we welcome. We'll welcome public health advisor Nicole Witt to the table. Paul and Michelle, welcome. And the floor is yours. Okay. Good morning, chair members of the subcommittee. I am pleased to be here this morning to provide an update on the environmental scan and needs assessments supporting opioid response planning. I'm joined by our partner, doctor Shiota, director of ASU Substance use and addiction Translational Research network, or as we call it, Saturn. For context. Fatal overdoses increased 39% in Phoenix between 2019 and 2022. In 2021, the city of Phoenix joined cities, towns and counties across Arizona, signing on to the one Arizona Memorandum of Understanding, which sets out guidelines for opioid settlements. In 2022, the city began to receive opioid settlement funds, and it's anticipated we will receive these funds annually for up to 18 years. In the spring of 2023, the Office of Public health presented to council, identifying the need to complete a needs assessment to determine the priorities for opioid settlement dollars within the city, and we launched this process in April May of 23 with a community opioid education forum and each of our eight council districts. There were three assessments completed in 23 as part of this process. Two were led by our colleagues at the Maricopa County Health Department, and the third was led by our Office of Public Health in partnership with ASU Saturn. And the intent of these assessments were to understand the current landscape of services, the needs of the community, and priorities for action. The substance use needs assessment. The first one focused on substance use providers and response agencies. Through interviews and online survey and focus groups. More than 300 agencies were engaged and majority of these agencies were in Phoenix. In total, there were more than 30 recommendations in the report categorized into the four main areas shown here on the screen, and the FOA report was completed in July of 23 and can be found on the Maricopa County Health Department website. Service providers and agencies identified many barriers with the current system of services categorized under the areas of prevention, which includes strategies aimed at preventing use or harmful use harm reduction, which includes strategies aimed at reducing the negative consequences of substance use and treatment and recovery, which includes programs and services that assist people with managing their substance use. The top five barriers identified by providers for prevention or under the area of prevention are found here and include key challenges, including funding restrictions to specific populations or services that do not support a focus on prevention. Lack of access to early intervention for youth as prevention resources tend to focus on youth before they begin use and do not always address the needs of people in the early stages of substance use, as well as social media and stigma associated with substance use. When considering what should be funded under prevention providers, top priorities for prevention funding included services that address substance users at the beginning of their use of the early intervention stages, increasing programs in settings where k through twelve children and youth are found, such as schools and after school care and training and screening for mental health, substance use, and at risk individuals widely, as well as targeted media campaigns to increase awareness and reduce stigma were also identified as priorities under the area of harm reduction. Top barriers included fear of law enforcement so that would be considered a barrier to services, stigma associated with harm reduction services and the people who use them, and lack of awareness and acce", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "Discussion around the opioid response and results of the opioid planning environmental scan.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Identification of the increase in fatal overdoses by 39% between 2019 and 2022.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "City of Phoenix joined the one Arizona Memorandum of Understanding for opioid settlements.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Completion of needs assessments for opioid settlement fund priorities.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Barriers with current system of services identified, including funding restrictions and lack of early intervention and access for youth.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Top priorities for prevention funding include early intervention services, programs for children and youth, and mental health training and screening.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Top barriers to harm reduction included fear of law enforcement, stigma, and lack of awareness.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "Discussion around the opioid response and results of the opioid planning environmental scan.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Identification of the increase in fatal overdoses by 39% between 2019 and 2022.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "City of Phoenix joined the one Arizona Memorandum of Understanding for opioid settlements.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Completion of needs assessments for opioid settlement fund priorities.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Barriers with current system of services identified, including funding restrictions and lack of early intervention and access for youth.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Top priorities for prevention funding include early intervention services, programs for children and youth, and mental health training and screening.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Top barriers to harm reduction included fear of law enforcement, stigma, and lack of awareness.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 329692, "chunk_end_time": 744882, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/px9yBaMPnf8", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/px9yBaMPnf8?t=329s"}, {"start": 9000, "end": 15000, "text": " as prevention resources tend to focus on youth before they begin use and do not always address the needs of people in the early stages of substance use, as well as social media and stigma associated with substance use. When considering what should be funded under prevention providers, top priorities for prevention funding included services that address substance users at the beginning of their use of the early intervention stages, increasing programs in settings where k through twelve children and youth are found, such as schools and after school care and training and screening for mental health, substance use, and at risk individuals widely, as well as targeted media campaigns to increase awareness and reduce stigma were also identified as priorities under the area of harm reduction. Top barriers included fear of law enforcement so that would be considered a barrier to services, stigma associated with harm reduction services and the people who use them, and lack of awareness and access in general for harm reduction services. So, not surprisingly, when it came to priorities for harm reduction, funding providers identified increased the need to increase harm reduction outreach, education and care navigation as an important support for people who are currently using substances and increasing access to harm reduction supplies in the community, including naloxone, and increasing diversion of substance users away from criminal justice system and into supportive services. Lastly, the top barriers identified by providers to the treatment and recovery services in our community included unstable or lack of housing, lack of motivation for change, and lack of transportation. As we see with many other health concerns, it's very challenging for individuals to maintain or have success with any kind of treatment, treatment without stable housing or access to reliable transportation, and certainly in substance use. Many of those services require daily appointments as well. These barriers and challenges contribute to an individual's motivation for change it's very difficult to want to make such a drastic change when you do not have access to basic needs. Top funding priorities for treatment and recovery included providing wraparound services and housing for people in treatment and recovery. In addition, providers identified the need for post overdose response teams. These are folks who can respond within 24 to 72 hours of an overdose, as well as navigators and on call teams that can support people in their journey as well as create care connections between services. So, in addition to service providers, an assessment was completed with people who use drugs to gain their perspective on funding and service needs. Within this assessment, 525 people completed a survey. In addition, 41 on one interviews were completed with people, people who use drugs and who were also experiencing homelessness at the time of the survey. It should be noted that overall in this assessment, a high proportion of respondents were people currently experiencing homelessness or who had had experience with homelessness in their near past. The report was released in October of 23, can also be found on the Maricopa county website and includes recommendations within the themes of housing, energy and security, drug use, use, harm reduction knowledge, substance use, treatment, health services and reproductive health, and I will just cover the first four today. Funding recommendations from people who use drugs for treatment include an improving overall treatment access, increasing services for basic health needs so including those within the services, and expanding mobile services. So rather than going to services, bringing services to people under harm reduction and drug use, people who use drugs identified the need to improve youth prevention as many acknowledge that their use began in their youth and improve access to harm reduction interventions. Housing also emerged as a key theme in this assessment and recommendations of substance users included increased supports for them to find and maintain housing, as well as reducing some of the barriers to housing and shelter use, acknowledging that there are many restrictions for substance use, current rules related to sobriety or drug free housing which can result in sudden loss of housing when people temporarily return to use, which is very common for substance users. And lastly, questions related to heat and energy security were specifically asked, recognizing the overlap of substance use and heat related death and people who use drugs noted a need to increase awareness of cooling centers in general, expand the number of cooling centers, and certainly increase their or accessibility for people who use drugs. I will now turn it over to my colleague, Doctor Shiota, who will cover our community needs assessment with Phoenix. Good morning chair and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for allowing me to join you today. It's been a real pleasure to work with Nicole and her team over this last year in this needs assessment and I look forward to our continued collaboration. Because the Maricopa county needs assessments that Nicole just discussed focused on the perspectives of substance use service providers and people who use drugs, we felt it important to hear from the city of Phoenix community as well, so we conducted a survey assessing phoenix residents experiences with substance use related problems, knowledge and attitudes, and, perhaps most important for our purposes today, their support for specific strategies to alleviate the opioid crisis. The survey was live and accessible from August through the end of October of 2023 and was completed by 765 people across the city. Women and white individuals are somewhat overrepresented relative to the Phoenix population, and there is some underrepresentation of African Americans and to some extent, Hispanics and Asian Americans.

It's been a real pleasure to work with Nicole and her team over this last year in this needs assessment and I look forward to our continued collaboration.

The survey was live and accessible from August through the end of October of 2023 and was completed by 765 people across the city. Women and white individuals are somewhat overrepresented relative to the Phoenix population, and there is some underrepresentation of African Americans and to some extent, Hispanics and Asian Americans. Otherwise, the sample was pretty representative in terms of demographics and distribution across districts. A key finding is that members of the Phoenix community are highly impacted by problems related to opioids and other substance use disorders. Disorders over 31%, about a third, have used opioids in the past five years. In many cases they reported that being prescription opioids, but in some cases it was illicit use. And of course, the evidence indicates that use of prescription opioids can end up moving toward addiction over time. Nearly half of respondents reported knowing someone personally who was addicted to opioids, and over 60% knew someone who was addicted to another substance. 42% reported having encountered at least one person who appeared to have overdosed in the past three years, and 70% feel that opioid use is a serious problem in their community. So Phoenix residents are significantly and personally impacted by these issues in their daily lives. We asked participants to rate their support for 19 specific initiatives that the city of Phoenix could invest in, and these included the general buckets of self substance use disorder prevention, harm reduction, and treatment related strategies, as well as a number of broader strategies. The response scale for each strategy ranged from one equals strongly opposed to five equals strongly supportive of the approach, with three as the midpoint indicating neither support nor opposition, and I mentioned that because the pattern of what we saw is so striking. The key finding is that there was substantial and positive support for every single approach that was included in the study. The vast majority of the items were rated at above a four on that five point scale, and none was rated below a 3.5, so there was no opposition to any of the strategies that we included in the study. The five top rated strategies by Phoenix community members who participated were providing programs for pregnant women and infants who had been exposed to drugs in utero prevention programs for youth, noting that the great majority of substance use and problematic. Substance use specifically begins during adolescence and early adulthood, increasing access to opioid and substance use treatment that are either free or affordable providing social services for substance users such as housing, food and employment. Again, building on the theme that Nicole mentioned earlier that it's really difficult to even contemplate, much less be successful at treatment and recovery if you're struggling to meet your basic needs, and then increasing education on substance use disorder and best practices for engaging with people who use drugs and are dealing with issues around addiction for law enforcement, first responders and other Phoenix staff, particularly those who are in highly public facing roles. So what can we take away from all of these sources of data? Considering the Maricopa county needs assessments as well as our own community survey, there's a great deal of convergence on what the priorities are for alleviating the suffering and community impact linked to opioid use disorder and substance use disorders more broadly. For the city of Phoenix, these are investing in ongoing surveillance and reliable data to inform decision making and evaluate the impact of the city's investments. Creating an amplifying, dedicated crisis and post overdose response teams who are specifically trained to handle incidents involving substance use and, in many cases, the significant mental health issues that co occur. Investing in evidence based prevention initiatives in k twelve settings and I'm going to add a comment here that the evidence strongly indicates that the kinds of prevention efforts that are most effective with youth are not necessarily specific to drugs. They address the risk and protection factors for youth risky behavior, generally speaking, and can be described in that way. They tend to have very widespread impact on substance use, yes, but also other kinds of mental health and behavioral health issues, school performance, risky sexual behavior, violence and aggression, delinquency and a wide range of other outcomes. Increased access to housing comes up over and over and over again because it provides stability that supports recovery. And even those who are not prepared to engage in treatment does provide an environment in which treatment seeking is more feasible and desirable. Increased harm reduction outreach aimed at saving the lives of people who use drugs so that they can live to fight another day. This includes increased access to naloxone, which reverses opioid overdoses supporting a team of dedicated care navigators to help people struggling with substance use disorder to access the various social services and forms of care that are needed for the best shot at recovery diversion away from an incarceration and toward treatment for drug related offenses increased transportation access for people to get to an", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "A key finding is that members of the Phoenix community are highly impacted by problems related to opioids and other substance use disorders.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The five top-rated strategies by Phoenix community members who participated were providing programs for pregnant women and infants who had been exposed to drugs in utero prevention programs for youth.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Increasing access to opioid and substance use treatment that are either free or affordable.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Providing social services for substance users such as housing, food, and employment.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Increasing education on substance use disorder and best practices for engaging with people who use drugs and are dealing with issues around addiction for law enforcement, first responders, and other Phoenix staff, particularly those who are in highly public-facing roles.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "A key finding is that members of the Phoenix community are highly impacted by problems related to opioids and other substance use disorders.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The five top-rated strategies by Phoenix community members who participated were providing programs for pregnant women and infants who had been exposed to drugs in utero prevention programs for youth.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Increasing access to opioid and substance use treatment that are either free or affordable.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Providing social services for substance users such as housing, food, and employment.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Increasing education on substance use disorder and best practices for engaging with people who use drugs and are dealing with issues around addiction for law enforcement, first responders, and other Phoenix staff, particularly those who are in highly public-facing roles.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 967012, "chunk_end_time": 1342194, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/px9yBaMPnf8", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/px9yBaMPnf8?t=967s"}, {"start": 19000, "end": 25000, "text": "es, but also other kinds of mental health and behavioral health issues, school performance, risky sexual behavior, violence and aggression, delinquency and a wide range of other outcomes.

And finally, efforts to address and reduce the stigma associated with substance use and substance use distribution disorder, which is a highly established evidence based barrier to both treatment seeking and the provision of effective sud care. Okay, so our next steps include finalizing the community survey, which Doctor Shiota went over. Analysis and report for the community will integrate all of these survey findings together along with our Phoenix facility data and information to identify priorities for action. For Phoenix, we anticipate bringing forward a substance use strategic plan to council for approval, which will have a five year outlook, and from there bring forward annual action plans that align with those identified priorities for investment and funding on a routine and regular basis. We thank you for your time today and allowing us to give this update and certainly are available to ask or answer any questions that you may have. Thank you very much. I'll go to my colleagues first. Does anybody have any questions? Councilwoman Hodge Washington yes, I just had a couple questions. Going back to slide number 16, talking about the strategy supported by our community, you did mention that there was really no, I don't want to say there's no real meaningful distinction between the 19 offered strategies. I was just curious to see if there are any strategies that you feel are not funded by another entity of government that we should focus on, just from a prioritization standpoint. That's a great question. Right. And one of the things that we've been talking about. Thank you for your question. Right. Mister chair and Representative Hodge Washington it's a great question because there are a wide range of investments that are needed and some are better suited to the city level of support and others to more systemic. Right. Sort of the state level or potentially the county level that definitely influenced the conversations that we've had around what the priority investments should be. And the ones that are on the list here in slide 16 are, for the most part, those that are suitable for implementation at the city level, for instance, schools. Right. Our city level entities, much of the mobilization around providing naloxone and other harm reduction services is operating at the city level. Mobile services, transportation, even housing. Right. These are initiatives that are suited to being implemented within the context of, of a city. Through you, mister chair. Thank you. Councilwoman Hodge Washington. I'll just add that our office of Public Health is working closely and regularly with our county partners, as well as state partners, both through access and the Arizona Department of Health Services to ask that very question. What is currently being funded. The Maricopa County Health Department just recently released their strategy and so we'll be, we will be reviewing that and making sure that whatever we bring forward isn't duplicating what is already being funded within the environment as well as supports those fund what is being funded. Which is why it was important for us to wait for the process for our county folks and other government partners to put forward their approaches. And as you said, we will look at things that are very, that are focused more at a city level that we have the ability to have some control over. Makes sense for a city to invest in. Certainly those items in the end related to data surveillance, we are already actively working on that crisis and post over response is an area that certainly cities are more so than our county partners or our state partners partners. That's an area of investment and intervention that we have more control over. And then, as Doctor Shiota mentioned, k through twelve settings is another area where we know that there is a considerable gap as well as within youth services. I will note that in all of these assessments, actually k through twelve was not a strong focus. So even in the service provider assessment, there wasn't a perfect purposeful engagement of that sector. And so we recognize that if that recommendation comes forward, we will have to do a little bit more work in understanding what are the needs within k twelve settings and what should those actual actions be at the local level. So there's a little bit more work that needs to be done specifically with youth providing services and youth settings. So thank you for the clarification. My interest was piqued when I heard that all of the strategies kind of got equal. I just want to make sure I understood the weight and or kind of how the decision was made to present this top five to us.

I just want to make sure I understood the weight and or kind of how the decision was made to present this top five to us. I just want to say that I appreciate the hard work done in this report because I think our community acknowledges that this is an issue that affects just about every phoenician in some way, and we need to be intentional and informed our decision regarding the policy for this. So I just want to say thank you for your efforts. And I believe that the effectiveness of this plan can only be done if you're responsive to the needs of those that are impacted. And I really was happy and delighted to see the level of input that you receive from individuals who are firsthand experienced in this. So thank you to both of you. Thank you, chairman. I just want to echo those comments. I think this is some of the most important work that we're doing at the city. There's very few issues that I think we hear more about as elected leaders than this intersection between housing and security, but also concern around youth and addiction and of course, how it all interrelates with homelessness and all the rest. So thank you so much. Very much grateful that we have these opioid settlement funds that we can use. And I think the work that you two are both doing is very, very critical, and I'm sure the community will appreciate what's next. Thank you. And I'd like to add my, excuse me, my thanks to the two of you as well and your entire teams. The information is critical. I mean, I don't know how else you look at it. You know, you said early on in the presentation the amount of people who are phoenicians who are impacted by this, you know, I don't know of anybody who isn't. So that in and of itself is sad. And the actual questions I had, or clarification, you answer them from Councilman Hodge, Washington. When she asked for some clarification, my big issue was that prevention in k through twelve settings, you know, what more are we doing? What should we be doing? But you got into that. And the one thing I will ask for a little bit of clarification on, or I think what more should we be doing, if anything, is the justice system diversion. You know, I understand, and this is, you know, with a few years in law enforcement understanding that you're not going to solve the problem by incarcerating people, that's just not going to happen. So what more, from your standpoint, should we be doing from a justice system diversion standpoint? Sort of an open kind of question, but I'll thank you for the question, mister chair. I'll start and then perhaps my colleague would like to add, I will just say we are in this process. We do have an internal team that's looking at our opioid response planning and that crosses almost every department within the city. And then our Office of Public Health works very closely with both our fire department and our police department. As far as diversion, we're also, we also work closely with our county colleagues who are doing quite a bit of work in our county jail system related to the provision of treatment. So mat and mood services within our jail systems and also looking at the issues around reentry into community and making sure the supportive services are there. I think we can, in the survey results identify this. Certainly we need to do more to reduce stigma in our community. You know, fear of law enforcement was one that was noted. It makes sense when you talk about substance users, especially substance users who are using substances illegally, there's a natural. That's natural to have that fear. So I think a little bit more work on educating our community around things like our good samaritan laws and doing more outreach, I think is definitely something that we need to. To continue to work on. And I believe we are already working on that. And then just increasing that trust that diversion is an option and that services are there to support people and making those connections with the services that are available. And I'm sure Doctor Shioda will add, but we do know that at that moment that someone is seeking services, we need them to be readily available right at that moment. Right. Or that moment passes. And so, so I think, you know, again, doing more work to support our justice colleagues too, to make sure that they can make those connections so that diversion can be successful, would definitely be something that we need to look at. They are very interconnected, certainly what's, you know, treatment access and availability, as well as the ability to be able to divert people into the services that they may need. And I'll turn it over to see if Doctor Shayota Shioda would like to add anything. Thank you so much for the question, Mister chair, which is a really crucial one. And coming up in countries, in cities all over the country. Right. It's certainly not unique to Phoenix. I really want to highlight the phrase that Nicole used of supporting our justice colleagues. So in the environmental scan, one thing that we heard over and over again from folks in law enforcement is a frustration about being on the front lines in dealing with ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "So there's a little bit more work that needs to be done specifically with youth providing services and youth settings.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There's very few issues that I think we hear more about as elected leaders than this intersection between housing and security, but also concern around youth and addiction and of course, how it all interrelates with homelessness and all the rest.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We are very much grateful that we have these opioid settlement funds that we can use.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "So mat and mood services within our jail systems and also looking at the issues around reentry into community and making sure the supportive services are there.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Certainly we need to do more to reduce stigma in our community.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "So I think a little bit more work on educating our community around things like our good samaritan laws and doing more outreach.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We need to do more work to support our justice colleagues too, to make sure that they can make those connections so that diversion can be successful.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "So there's a little bit more work that needs to be done specifically with youth providing services and youth settings.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There's very few issues that I think we hear more about as elected leaders than this intersection between housing and security, but also concern around youth and addiction and of course, how it all interrelates with homelessness and all the rest.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We are very much grateful that we have these opioid settlement funds that we can use.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "So mat and mood services within our jail systems and also looking at the issues around reentry into community and making sure the supportive services are there.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Certainly we need to do more to reduce stigma in our community.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "So I think a little bit more work on educating our community around things like our good samaritan laws and doing more outreach.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We need to do more work to support our justice colleagues too, to make sure that they can make those connections so that diversion can be successful.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1611854, "chunk_end_time": 1985360, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/px9yBaMPnf8", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/px9yBaMPnf8?t=1611s"}, {"start": 29000, "end": 35000, "text": "le right at that moment.

Right. But not having the training to do so for those kinds of encounters and not. And some perception of sort of role conflict. Right. Am I here to enforce the law or am I here to provide social services and connections? And we would hope that those would not be an either or situation. But there, there are two ways that we can bridge that gap. One of them is providing, as came up in, I was the fifth rated most desired right action in the community survey of providing additional training to law enforcement and other public facing, in particular city employees on how to deal what these issues even are and how to deal with them, with members of the community who are living with them on a day to day basis effectively. But then in addition to that, having the dedicated crisis response teams so that that burden does not fall exclusively on law enforcement. So it's really meeting in the middle, right. Between moderately expanding the perspective and the roles that law enforcement are able to play, comfortable playing and empowered to play in these situations, but also providing people who really do have the deeper expertise in order to be able to manage these situations effectively. Thank you very much. There aren't any other questions. Again, thank you too, very much. Really appreciate all that you're doing, and clearly it's extremely important work. So many thanks. Next we move to item number six, an exciting update from the library about the new bookmobile. So as Rita Hamilton comes to the table, I want to start by Carl's with her. Carl Kendall is with her, the deputy library director. But before we get started, I want to acknowledge and recognize and congratulate Rita on her upcoming retirement. It is, yeah, you will be missed. And, you know, this is so true, especially in your case. The city of Phoenix is a wonderful place to work, and it's because of the people who work here, and you're a big part of it, and we're a better place because you have been here and really hate to see you go. But I want to put a little bit of an emphasis or a focus on a few things. What Rita has had an impact on, she's really moved the library of services through automation, a growing library system incorporating and advancing technologies. Rita initially worked for the Phoenix library as a deputy director of public services. She left Phoenix, went to the Scottsdale Public Library as their director. She saw the light, came back to Phoenix is the Phoenix City librarian in 2011, and as the Phoenix City librarian, she has directed all library operations at the Burton Bar Central Library and 16 branch libraries providing services or specialized library services such as the College Depot, Startup Phoenix and Phoenix Works. I will tell you, Rita, those things have made a significant impact on hundreds of people's lives, if not thousands, and you are to truly be congratulated for that. During the pandemic, which was a tough time for everyone, she led the library team in a shift to provide services in a different way by incorporating drive up services as well as serving as a public health outlet for Covid tests. Additionally, as we were just talking about issues with substance abuse and such, additionally, the library during her tenure has worked with public health to be a resource for naloxone distribution. I always say that wrong and I apologize. But the library system also is a recipient of ARPA dollars to implement fresh and refreshed ideas such as the 24/7 book lockers, bookmobile, and enhanced small business resources. Under your leadership. You know, Rita has led the team to partner and be flexible to provide an outlet for whatever resources the community felt was necessary. So again, Rita you've made everything really. You've made the library services much better than it ever was before. Big shoes to follow to whomever ends up in that role. But wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for everything and the folks in my office. Jenny Ringenroth wanted me to especially thank you for doing away with the library fines after she found a book in her son's room that was a little overdue. So she thanks you for that. But, you know, I just want you to know how much you will be missed, how much you have been appreciated, and you've meant a whole lot to this city. So thank you again. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. We do run the best library system in the country right here. So I've been very proud and to be part of that. And I know that we have great folks that work at the library, and it will all be great going forward. And I've just been honored to be part of this library and all the great things that we have been able to do, and I really appreciate your honoring me in this way. Thank you. Right.

So good morning, Chairman Robinson and members of the subcommittee. I would like to introduce Carl Kendall to tell you about our new bookmobile. Good morning, chairman and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to provide you with information about Rita's latest achievement, Phoenix Public Library's recently acquired Bookmobile and the Bookmobile's initial service delivery plan. Now, Phoenix Public Library actually has a long history of providing bookmobile services to underserved communities. The library first started a bookmobile, believe it or not, in the 1940s. The then city librarian, Jane Hudgens requested that the city purchase a prefabricated bookmobile. Instead of giving up when the request was denied, Miss Hutchins worked with the transportation department to retrofit an old city bus into a makeshift bookmobile. As you see there in that picture, so you can't keep a good librarian down. They will find a way to get those books out to the community. The Phoenix Public Library continued to provide bookmobile services for the next five decades. There's a couple of iterations of the bookmobile there. Bookmobile service was eventually shelved in 1991 during an economic downturn, however. But the good news is it's back and bigger than ever before. Here it is in all its glory, parked outside of the Burton Bar Central Library shortly after it was delivered to us on November 30, 2023, the 38 foot coach style bookmobile was funded as part of the city's ARpa community investment focus area in order to extend library resources and services throughout Phoenix. The vehicle is staffed by five full time library employees, all of whom had to pass a three day special driving course offered by fleet services staff in order to be able to operate this vehicle. The bookmobile is outfitted with approximately 25 items for checkout featuring a diverse range of authors, genres and age levels. Seed library items, culture passes and access to free public Wi Fi will also be available. The driver's seat and passenger seat you can see kind of at the front of the picture there. Those rotate 180 degrees to face a tabletop work area where staff can create new cards for customers, check out their materials, or assist them with connecting to information and resources. Some of the bookshelves, as you can see to the left there the picture, are actually mobile book carts that can be wheeled outside during outdoor events. In the back area here, as you can see of the bookmobile, there's a very small but mighty children's nook with bench seating where story times can be conducted when it's too hot outside to do so because yes, the inside of the bookmobile is air conditioned. When the weather does allow, though, our bookmobile librarians will provide a plethora of outdoor activities and programming during their visits, such as the aforementioned story times, baby times, our kindergarten boot camps, steam activities and more. Assisting with these outdoor programs will be a built in outdoor sound system and flat screen tv mounted on the side of the vehicle, which you can see there in the photo, as well as some mermaids. The vehicle, designed and built by Farber specialty vehicles in Ohio, includes an accessible lift for ADA access and a 20 foot retractable awning to provide shade and shelter for outdoor access to activities. There you can see the awning when it's fully deployed. Health and wellness items distributed through our brick and mortar library locations such as Narcan Covid tests, bottled water, etcetera will also be available on the bookmobile while supplies last. The library is currently working with our partners in the neighborhood services department and the streets department to transform a vacant lot owned by the library at 67th Avenue and Lower Buckeye into a permanent home for the bookmobile. The footprint of the lot can be seen here as outlined in red. The lot sits adjacent to a cv's with a car wash currently under construction to the north. Funded by community development block grant funds, the future home base will include a storage unit for the bookmobile, lighting and security cameras, public restrooms and more. The bookmobile lot project should be heading into the design phase within the next one to two months. So where will the bookmobile be going and when. The bookmobile will provide regular service Tuesday through Saturday every week, and its primary focus will be on serving neighborhoods with limited access to library services. Its initial outreach approach will be threefold. Provide regularly scheduled hours at Santa Maria and Trailside park parks, make regular stops at community partners such as elementary schools, senior centers and low income senior housing, and be available for visits to one off community events and all this great stuff be starting extremely soon. An official unveiling event for the public is scheduled for this Saturday, March 23, at Santa Maria park beginning at 11:00 a.m. those who are in attendance will be able to check out library materials, sign up for a card, take a tour of the bookmobile, participate in library activities, ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Phoenix Public Library", "insights": [{"observation": "Phoenix Public Library's

Okay, thank you very much. And do I have any questions from thank you. I just want to say how excited I am about this. The Estrella region of our city has never had their own library, so this is a really great start. And this bookmobile, I know the community is very excited that it will be serving as a stopgap until the official branch library, which was approved in the general obligation bond this past year, will be built. So we're very, very excited about that this Saturday. We're looking forward to joining you. My team and I will be there for the opening of the bookmobile and I really want to thank not only the library team, but Fowler school board member Lisa Perez for helping to organize the event. So thank you so much. This is incredibly exciting. I had a great time coming to check it out with the kids when I was outside Burton bar. Thank you, chair. I also wanted to just applaud the effort. The data shows that children who read regularly tend to perform better academically across subjects. It's been proven it's been linked to improved cognitive skin, vocabulary development, and empathy as a whole. We know the data also shows that sometimes lower income families don't have necessarily have access to books and reading materials, and also the digital divide is still there. I am personally a fan of bookmobiles and the tiny little libraries. Free little libraries. I'm sorry. So I'm just very grateful that we are doing this. And it is my hope that we are so successful that Phoenix will not have just one bookmobile, but we would expand to a fleet of bookmobiles where we can help build better communities, inspire future readers. And you never know, we might be also fostering the next generation of authors. So thank you for all that you do on this. This is, I know, nothing negative to say about it. Just excited to see it. I hope that it is received well in our community. And again, I hope that we have such an increased demand that we can move this, we can take this and duplicate this throughout our city. So thank you. And I just want to offer my congratulations. This is, you know, as both my colleagues have mentioned, it's a tremendous, it's a wonderful thing. You guys are being congratulated for it. You. Thank you. Thanks to you and your team. So please pass our heartfelt, heartfelt thanks on to all of them. We really appreciate all the hard work, and thank you very much. And again, Rita, congratulations. Thank you so very much. Appreciate it. Bye bye. See you soon. Next, we'll welcome deputy city manager Gina Montez and deputy human services director Susan Hallett to the table for item number seven. Good morning, Chairman Robinson, members of the subcommittee, we're pleased to be with you this morning to discuss this very important issue of legal representation for civil eviction hearings and proposals for the right to counsel. As you're aware, during the pandemic we had, one of the opportunities it presented was funding for us to provide legal representation to folks facing eviction. And we have learned quite a bit from that process and have continued to provide some of this pandemic funding to address those very important issues of folks in eviction hearings. Before we get started, I did want to acknowledge a key community partner, Pam Bridge, with community legal services. She's in the audience, and she is the director of litigation and advocacy. And without community legal services, we wouldn't have had the opportunity to provide this service to the community. And granted, we sometimes it feels like a drop in the bucket in terms of what is needed for folks. And really having legal representation enables people to. To have the process followed, you know, followed well, and giving them every opportunity to make things right and be able to stay in their homes. So today we have a presentation that kind of discusses the history of that and what we've learned and where we are. The funds that we have towards this service, they are finite, and they are funding that will end in the near future. But we're happy to open this discussion and tell you what we learned and also wanted to introduce Susan Hallett, who's our director, deputy human services director, and she has been key in many of the issues facing our most vulnerable populations. Her team was very involved as well in the mobile home parks and helping folks to get situated in partnership with other community partners, and has been overseeing this contract with community legal services. So I'm going to hand the presentation over to Susan at this point.

But we're happy to open this discussion and tell you what we learned and also wanted to introduce Susan Hallett, who's our director, deputy human services director, and she has been key in many of the issues facing our most vulnerable populations. Her team was very involved as well in the mobile home parks and helping folks to get situated in partnership with other community partners, and has been overseeing this contract with community legal services. So I'm going to hand the presentation over to Susan at this point. Okay, thank you. All right, thank you. As Gina introduced, we're here to present information related to exploring legal representation for tenants and civil eviction hearings as background to this issue. Maricopa county continues to be among the highest communities in the nation experiencing eviction filings. Last year, 83 over 83,000 eviction complaints were filed, representing a 23% increase from the prior year. And in January 2024, over 8000 filings were received, putting the county on pace to exceed 2023 filings by another 15%. According to the William E. Morris Institute for Justice, in Maricopa County, 94% of landlords have legal representation, compared to less than 1% tenants. Tenants having legal representation gives them a fair chance in court, and when tenants have a fair chance, eviction filings drop. Across the United States, many communities are implementing right to council initiatives as a primary mitigation to reduce evictions, particularly for low income, vulnerable and diverse communities. Communities as of July 23 or July 2020, 317 cities in four states have adopted right to council policies, including Philadelphia, Baltimore and Cleveland. Philadelphia estimates that for every dollar spent providing legal representation to low income tenants, it will receive a benefit of more than $12. This resulted in a 3.5 million investment, saving their community over 45 million. Likewise, Baltimore has been able to invest $6 million to save over 17 million, and Cleveland's investment in right to council policies is anticipated to yield an estimated 4.7 million in fiscal savings. In addition to reducing eviction filings. Excuse me. In addition to reducing eviction filings and keeping vulnerable residents housed and the general cost savings, right to council policies have also lessened community costs associated with job loss, physical and mental health issues, increased shelter and emergency housing, increased administrative burdens for courts and then research has also shown that benefits of preventing tenants from experiencing displacement or disruption arising from eviction leads to a reduction in hospital and emergency room costs, a reduction in juvenile delinquency and adult crimes, an increased confidence in the justice system, and ultimately, the preservation of affordable housing stock. In response to the rising eviction rates in Phoenix stemming from tenants experiencing financial crisis due to the COVID pandemic, the Human Services department created the Tenants Eviction Assistance project in partnership with community legal services. At that time, substantial concern existed within the community about housing instability, increasing risks of contacting and or spreading the virus among low income populations. Since July of 2020, the Human Services department has executed several contracts committing over 3.6 million in cares act, community services block grant and ARPA funding to maintain legal assistance, advocacy and representation for Phoenix residents experiencing an eviction crisis. The current contract expires this December. To date, community Legal Services has worked over 8300 cases involving 16,000 residents, which computes to about an average of 300 plus cases being handled every month. In the last half of 2023, community legal services was able to stop an eviction in 31 cases and for another 17 cases took the matter to trial in one. These positive outcomes not only impact immediate tenants, but are able to support the family members that also are impacted by those outcomes. Some additional information regarding teap outcomes outcomes directly tied to the Tenants Eviction Assistance project include dismissal of eviction filings without prejudice, continuance of hearings to allow tenants more time to receive financial assistance, stay of hearings due to previous center for Disease control moratoriums, and more cases being settled, experts report that due process and procedural fairness are critical elements to a balanced court system and therefore, in addition to yielding positive individual, tenant and household outcomes, legal representation to all tenants ensures more equitable access to justice and reduces the devastating harms of eviction that may be more disproportionately felt by black and brown residents and women. Great. Now for some lessons learned. Providing legal representation for tenants in civil eviction hearings has generated many lessons learned to include that rising evictions have become a public health crisis. When both parties are represented, less eviction complaints are filed. Right to council policies can alleviate power imbalances and increased tenant representation reduces gentrification strategies and disproportionately affected low income and minority residents.

In summary, John Pawlik, who is coordinator with the National Coalition for a civil right to council, states, Housing is a basic need that demands strong protection. To this end, national organizations are recommending that governments at all levels take action to ensure that, facing that, those facing eviction are provided with legal representation. Mister chairman and subcommittee members in support of the agenda item and as Gina also shared, representatives from the community legal services and unemployed workers United are also present in the audience today. We are happy to answer any questions you might have at this time. Okay, thank you very much. I'll go to my colleagues first. Do you have any questions? No. Councilwoman Hodge, Washington thank you. I want to start off by saying, as an attorney who personally has represented individuals in eviction proceedings, I think this is a great idea. I am 100% in support of it. I think we just need to. It will be shoring up our eligibility concerns. I think the people are folks at the community legal services for the work that they've done. And I want to thank the city staff for implementing and recommending the tenant program because I personally have referred individuals to that program and have seen the success stories. So it is definitely, I believe that housing is a right that should be protected as much as possible. I know we have to balance the private ownership rights, but we also have to make sure that they're not being abused and misguided by the landlords in their housing needs. I just had a couple questions regarding the teap outcomes. I think it's important if we can, are there any statistics you can provide for us to show the percentage of those that were dismissed? Eviction filings, continuance of hearings, stay of hearings or settlements? And then the other question I also had was, do we have any data as to whether or not the percentage of cases that are, were assisted were basically monetary defaults or non monetary defaults? Because I think we. I'll stop with my question. I'll let you address my multiple questions. Let's start with slide number seven. Do we have any data on the outcomes that we have received from a team chairman? Councilman Hodge, Washington. If it's okay, we'd like to invite Pam Bridge up to join us to help address some of the outcomes questions, if that's okay. Yes, that's perfect. Thank you. Welcome, Pam. And just for clarification, can you give us your full name and your title? Yes, I'm Pamela Bridge. I'm the director of advocacy and litigation at community Legal services. Thank you. Thank you, Pamela. Welcome to the table. My question, as you may have heard, is understanding some of the statistics for the outcomes received through the Tipperson Washington. We do have statistics on our outcomes. I don't think we just changed our data collection process. I don't think that our data is indicative of all of the successes that we have right now. We are training the staff. I think this next round of data that we supply will be accurate. I found when I looked through cases that I saw successes by the advocates, that they were only stating that they were not giving the data into the system, that that would allow the people that were submitting this to the city to see the actual result we saw. So what I'm saying is we know that we have more successes than even the data shows right now. But we have a mechanism in our data right now to collect all outcomes. So you will be provided that in our next round in a way more accurate manner. And I think I understand what you're saying. Many times you'll have a conversation with opposing counsel, receive a resolution that negotiate, a resolution that works for both sides, but it doesn't fit squarely into one of these categories is kind of what you're saying in the past. Chairperson Washington, we now have data that will show that that is a negotiation that ended in settlement that prevented the eviction. And that happens a great deal that we, even if there's not merit in the case, we negotiate on behalf of the tenant to stop the eviction judgment, to give them more time so that the tenant can move out on their terms. And then the landlord also gets possession eventually, but the tenant is able to move out on their time. It's a win win win. And those are the cases when there is no legal merit that we do. If there's legal merit, we will get the complaint to see. I understand that. And do we have any data to show whether or not the percentages of cases are primarily monetary default or non monetary default? And if they're non monetary default, can you give us some examples of the top cases that you see in those situations for our chairperson, Washington? Make sure I understand the question. Is it the percentage of cases that we're seeing, 75% are nonpayment of rental. Is that the question that you're looking for? Yes. I want to see the types of cases that you're handling. Sure. 75% are nonpayment of rent. And even in nonpayment of rent cases, there are defenses that we look at that we might be able to throw out the complaint. Within the other percentage, they are, the tenant violated t", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Community Legal Services", "insights": [{"observation": "Providing legal representation for tenants in civil eviction hearings has generated lessons learned, including that rising evictions have become a public health crisis.

Sure. 75% are nonpayment of rent. And even in nonpayment of rent cases, there are defenses that we look at that we might be able to throw out the complaint. Within the other percentage, they are, the tenant violated the lease or they allegedly violate the lease, and we can help the tenant prove that they didn't violate the lease. We also see a high percentage in the last year of non renewals where the landlord has decided to not renew the lease. And that doesn't need, you know, they don't need a reason for that unless the tenant lives in a type of federal subsidized housing. So that's one of the first things that we always look for. Are they in subsidized housing? Because then federal regulations apply and we can protect the tenant that way. But those non renewals are difficult. And in those situations, if it's not federally subsidized housing, then we look at, can we negotiate with the landlord and we can give you the percentages of all of nonpayment of rent and material violations and non renewals. We do break that down. And then also, I don't know if you keep any data regarding the type of the tenants that you're able to assist, because I think we can agree that we are seeing an increase in our older population and want to make sure that they have access. So do we have data? You may not be able to provide it right now, but I would like to see the data to show which individuals we are assisting and how we can extend the reach of the program to make sure that individuals are aware of it. Unfortunately, I can continue to run into individuals that are unaware of the program, and I think it would be helpful for us to keep track of how individuals are finding out about the program and how we can increase its reach. Yes, we do keep data of all of our, we collect every demographics of all of our clients who apply at CL's. And so we do see trends involved vulnerable populations and tenants. And we also acknowledge that we, that there are tenants who don't know about us. So part of our goals for 2024 are to increase awareness in the community by, number one, being in person at locations also, instead of virtual going to the community, doing clinics every month in the community so that they'll know about us. We're creating videos in Spanish and English that will be for all tenants in Phoenix. And we are also brochuring the highest, we know what apartment complex have the highest eviction rate, and we are also planning to give brochures to those tenants, which was a suggestion from a justice court judge. Thank you again. I respect and appreciate the right to counsel in these types of cases because, as noted, there is a power dynamic. It is a complex legal proceeding. It does help us prevent homelessness and the instability that comes with it. It also is important to ensure that we're protecting the due process rights of our tenants. And it is a, I think it is, it's the right and fair thing for us to do in this case. So I just want to say thank you. From one lawyer to another. I want to say thank you and thank deputy director Gina Montez, as well as Susan for moving this initiative forward. There are instances where just simply having the right advocate can make the right to make the difference for someone. So thank you, chair, for the opportunities to ask my questions and voice my comments. You're welcome, Councilwoman Ansari. Thank you. First of all, Chairman Robinson, I really want to thank you for bringing this discussion to subcommittee. As a council, we are constantly looking at ways to address address our homelessness crisis. And while I wholeheartedly support all of the investments we're making in shelter and services, an investment that we can make to actually prevent homelessness from the beginning, I think is very worth our while. As you just clearly explained, right to council will do just that and help balance our current eviction system, save the city money in additional rental assistance, shelter and mental health services, and keep people housing secure. So I think it's a win win. It's very rare that we have the opportunity to both address our housing and homelessness crisis and save funds in the long run. So I think we should take this proposal very seriously. I wanted to highlight some of the success of other jurisdictions that I think are very striking. The fact that Philadelphia projects $45 million in savings for a $3 million investment I believe is huge. In Kansas City, over 80% of cases that were provided legal assistance were resolved through dismissal judgments in favor of the tenants or settlements. Many tenants facing eviction end up having to pay far more than they even owe in back rent, as you mentioned, and legal representation can help them lower their amount owed and set up a payment plan to make the situation more feasible. So I'm also very grateful that we have a lawyer finally on council who can, can verify that these proposals are going to be worth our while. So with that, I do have a couple of questions.

If you could speak to, you know, I think what we're proposing today, somewhat of a phased expansion of the community legal services. Can you speak to who is currently eligible for that program? And if there, and I know you touched on that slightly, are there specific income or demographic groups that staff would recommend being the next added to it? Currently it is a city of Phoenix residents who are within 200% of our poverty, of the federal poverty line. I did talk to tip our director before coming here, and he stated that it is very rare currently that. That we are turning down individuals that we don't see right now, individuals with a higher income than that we know they are. I just don't think that they are applying for community legal services because we have that eligibility pretty all over the documents. So individuals who are 200% of the federal poverty line and currently they also, at least one member of their household who is facing an eviction must have some type of legal status in the United States. Got it. And what would next steps look like to expand this program? We are, of course, simultaneously having budget conversations, and we know that we are focused on conserving funds in the coming budget cycle, given the shortfall we're going to have. So I'm wondering if there are other, if something like this would have to come from our general budget or if there's other sources of potential funding. Are there any buckets of money through the state or federally that we could look at if we were to expand? Chairman Robinson, Councilwoman Ansari, that is something that we need to further explore. This is something that kind of recently came up in this type of fashion. And so right now we can look at federal funds that we already have within the city. I think we have limitations in terms of kind of the need and where those funds are already kind of allocated. But knowing if this is something that the subcommittee would like for us to explore, we can certainly look to identify additional grant funding from others. And as you mentioned, we are in a tight budget environment at this point. We aren't presenting as city departments and additional supplementals for consideration. And I know that the, the trial budget was presented yesterday, so we would likely need to look for alternative funding sources other than the general fund simply because, you know, again, that's council's prerogative. But just given what I know that we need to continue in current services that are being, funding with, being funded right now with federal funds, we have to kind of think about all those things and how that happens and what the priorities of the council are will be to be determined. But if this is something the subcommittee would like for us to further pursue, we can look into funding sources. Got it. And while I acknowledge this is my last subcommittee meeting, it sounds like there's support. I'll speak with my colleagues, but personally, I would very much hope that you will explore what our options are out there with different pockets of money or philanthropic money even, because I think this would be a worthwhile investment for the city that maybe other entities would want to support us in it. In our work with the unsheltered community, I'm wondering if we have data that shows how many have been evicted in the past and if so, what specific effects have we seen on them attempting to find housing afterward? Chairman Robinson? Councilman, I'm sorry, that is something that I don't have at my fingertips, but we can definitely find that information and see what we have with, within our data sources and bring that back, provide that at a later time. Okay. That's all my questions. Thank you so much. Really, really appreciate this, and I really hope to see this work continue. Thank you. You know, I'll follow up a little bit on what Councilwoman Ansari was saying with regard to seeking or exploring the opportunities for additional funding, understanding our budgetary restraints. You know, we have to keep that in mind, obviously. But I would like to see us explore what other opportunities are available, both governmental as well as the private sector, that we could partner with, that we could go to in a true partnership and allow for this program to move forward. So plenty of opportunity to do that, I'm sure. Hate to give folks more work, but, you know, it's an important endeavor. So with that, thank you very much. You guys did a wonderful job. Thank you for bringing this information forward. And as both my colleagues mentioned, it is, again, we've heard nothing but good things today, and this is on top of it, you know, trying to help folks who need the help the most is, I think, what government is all about.

On January 17, I was along with a group of my peers in the downtown offices of the equal Opportunity department to deliver a formal complaint in regards to the ongoing discrimination practices of several apartments in the metro area. Unfortunately, this meeting was in vain. We were met with resistance and what felt like a general unwillingness for the accountable of those we advocate for. It was truly a disappointment. I worked hard with UWU to get the ordinance passed. Just a shame is not being enforced as it should be, leaving prospective voucher and low income folks disregarded. We need better education to property owners and landlords. We definitely need follow through and follow up procedures in place and rural enforcement to be addressed. Furthermore, with regards to the necessity of right of counsel, I have been struggling with the increases of rent and the current cost of living on a fixed income, leaving me, like so many in the valley, vulnerable to possible evictions. Without the possibility of provided representation, my eviction would most definitely be granted, and I would become homeless once again, which is why the right of counsel is so important and why I'm here today. Persons like myself need your help. Thank you very much. Have a good day, ayesha. Thank you very much. Next we have Nancy Palmer. Nancy, can you hear me okay? Yes. Hi, councilman. I'm a rookie at this. Hi, everybody. I am going to be homeless on May 5 at 05:00 p.m. we got this home in September 2020. We lost our home during COVID We were. We had the paperwork to not be evicted, but we were evicted anyways. But we were rescued by home ink and a new leaf, and we got a two year taboo program that was supposed to have us have continued assistance, but we were somehow priced out, or I don't know what happened. And when we still are living in the home, the landlord raised the rent 394%. Our only option was to give 30 day notice to vacate or pay $2,000 a month rent instead of under 500, which is what we could afford. We are a family of four living on $3,800 a month. I am losing my home. We did have right to counsel, which did stop an eviction that would have happened on the first week of March of this year. It was because we didn't renew the lease, but we needed to talk to the landlord about the lease because the lease was wrong, and we got blocked by the management company. And we don't even know who the landlord is. But we did have right to counsel, but their lawyer was the only person there. We never got to face our accuser. We never got to meet the landlord or talk to the person. He lives here locally. This house isn't even registered as a rental unit, is registered as a primary residence. They have three more homes that are listed as primary residence. Top property shop is kicking us out of our life, out of our home, and they're getting away with it. And I am frightened. Frightened. And without the lawyer there, we would have had to lose our home earlier this month. It is my birthday in three days. I will be 56 years old on March 23, and all I want is a house. My family's invested almost $400,000 over the past 25 years just to keep a roof over our head, these horribly built homes. And all I want is this one. We need to find a way. We need council we need counsel to stop these people from these pyramid schemes. Please help us. Please write to counsels. Extremely necessary. If there's a lawyer out there that can help us keep our home here in surprise, Arizona, where I've lived and raised my children for 25 years, please help us. My name is Nancy Palmer.

Thank you so much for taking the time to hear me today. My name is John Pollock. I am the coordinator of the National Coalition for a civil right to council, and our organization works to support efforts to enact the right to counsel in civil cases involving basic human needs housing, of which is a central one. We worked with all the 22 jurisdictions that have so far enacted a right to counsel the 17 cities, four states in one county. And I'll just share a couple of. A couple of data points with you, and then I'm happy to answer any questions you might have based on our experience. I know you heard some data earlier about the success of these programs in Kansas City and Philly, but every program where we've gotten data so far has been incredibly successful. They have a 50% unit retention rate in Washington state. Across the state, because it's a statewide right to council, 64% of the tenants in Connecticut have avoided an involuntary move. In Toledo, Ohio, 88% of the tenants who were represented were able to stay in their homes. So these are programs that we know work. It's an evidence based approach. But the benefits to these programs also extend to landlords, too, because when the relationship between the landlord and the tenant has really broken down. It's very difficult even for the landlord to try to figure out how to proceed with that tenant. And when there's an attorney for that tenant, the landlord can, and their attorney can deal with the tenant's attorney. And that makes it, you know, that that arm's length sort of relationship really does help with. With resolution of the disputes and in a way that can actually benefit both sides. That's what we've seen. And many, you know, attorneys on. In the landlord bar have said, you know, off the record, yes. It's actually much easier for us when the tenant has a lawyer. It's just easier to actually resolve these in a way that help everyone. The other thing I just wanted to mention quickly is that right to counsel. I know there are questions about funding, and I'm happy to answer how these have been funded around the country, but one thing that we often urge people to consider is that a right to counsel can be for, you know, everyone at 200% of the federal poverty level. It can also be a narrower category of people. If there's. If, you know, if the city says we don't have enough funding to provide counsel for everyone at 200%, that doesn't mean that it can't pass a right to council. It can actually add more eligibility requirements to make that work. All right, John, thank you very much. Clearly, you're a resource that we will be able to follow back on, so we appreciate your comments. Thank you. That complete the virtual. Okay, next we'll go to Keith Knight in person. Keith wanted to step up to the podium. Thank you. Hello, can you hear me? Yes, we can. Thank you. All right, ladies and gentlemen of the council, my name is Keith Knight. I am a Phoenix native and a third year law student at ASU, and I am here voluntarily to advocate for the right to counsel. So the right to counsel policy is supported by practically any form of data that. That you choose to look at. And what this is really about is housing stability, which is something that has been brought up several times during this meeting already. And the fact is that housing stability leads to a plethora of beneficial outcomes for the city of Phoenix. And we'll talk about the city first. So when the right to council policy has been implemented in cities, as we just heard in Philly and all these different jurisdictions, they actually save money overall. And this is because the homeless population will decrease the amount of services that are needed to service these populations that are usually expensive programs. They won't have to be paid for quite as much. And that's why implementing a policy that will lead to greater housing stability that will decrease homelessness, is greatly important, which I think all of you recognize, and I'm very heartened to hear that. And the reality is that right to counsel will reduce healthcare costs. There will be less emergency room visits, lower rates of mental illness, and less chronic health care problems in our city. There will be greater upward economic mobility, meaning a more equitable society in which each of our citizens has the right and the ability to be successful financially. So our city will be healthier, and it will also be wealthier. And as a native of Phoenix and as someone who will soon be serving as a lawyer, I want to live in a city that is seen as a beacon of societal health and progressive. And I would hope that each one of you wants that as well. Thank you, and please implement the right to counsel. Thank you very much. Next we have Pam Bridge. I don't know Pam, if you wanted to speak. Okay. I concede my time. Okay. Thank you very much then. Andrea Luna Cervantes. Good morning. I've given handouts on our right to council.

Okay. I concede my time. Okay. Thank you very much then. Andrea Luna Cervantes. Good morning. I've given handouts on our right to council. One pager for you to read. Good morning. My name is Andrea Lunas Cervantes. I'm a community organizer with unemployed workers united take back our Homes campaign. For the last year, our organization has been working with community members who are facing eviction and housing instability. Through that, we have connected those community members to resources like the city's tenant eviction assistance project and to community legal services. We've seen that the outcomes for people who have legal representations are better than the ones who don't. As you've already heard, on this call, we have John Pollack, a coordinator with the National Coalition for our civil right to council, an expert on right to council, and Kelly Sislik, our staff attorney, who has done research on right to counsel. As it pertains to the city of Phoenix, both individuals can lend their expertise on data that proves that this program is beneficial for the city. We have come here to ask you to form a right to council ordinance so that tenants who are being evicted have right to legal representation in the process. At the city of Phoenix, we know that this is also a matter regarding the budget and that you are being advised not to use any of those surplus of resources this year. But I do want to point out that this is a clear preventative measure that that the city can take to address our housing crisis. Data shows that preventative measures like this one provide a good return on investment, and it would take less resources to get people stabilized and housed than to find them housing options after they become homeless. I hope everyone in the subcommittee takes this into consideration and helps move this from an item of discussion to a voting item. I want to thank Susan Hallett, Gina Montez, for your work on this presentation, and thank you to Chairman Robinson for bringing this to the subcommittee and councilwoman Ansari for advocating. Thank you all for your time. Thank you very much. We had an opportunity to sit and meet with Andrea and probably one of the most single organized individuals and well versed on this topic. So thank you very much for your work. So, next. Mac Gar. Mac Garage. My testimony is that I'm supporting the city council for this program, and the question of eviction is the top of all these issues. Myself, I've been evicted from a company, and because I have money invested in the company that is fries. Fries company, and they are evicting me since the last week, they are evicting me from the company, taking over my money along with the company together. So that is the thing that I want to share with the. The council in a manner that those such issues could be helped on such issues by the city. That is the reason I'm standing here. I'm grieved by the fries company for taking over my company and that I didn't have any source to go to the court, and I'm just trying to appeal to the city in a manner that I could be helped. So that is one of the things. And then the eviction, they tried to evict me from the apartment. They took it over from me. That is a part of the company that is supposed to belong to me. They took it over. They took it over now, and they increased my rent, which is not affordable to me. So that is one of the things that the council has to take into consideration. So I'm really glad to hear all the arguments which were presented here to the council, and I support your programs. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Next we have Morningstar Bloom. Hello, members of the subcommittee. My name is Morningstar Bloom. I live at 1645 East Thomas Road, number 21 five. I'm here representing worker power. I'm also here speaking as a renter myself. Like many renters in Phoenix, I have seen the extraordinary rise in the cost of rental. And so now my rent makes up more than 30% of my income. A recent study from the Harvard Joint center for Housing Studies found that just over 50% of renter households in Arizona are cost burdened by rent, putting these renters at increased risk of eviction. And homelessness. As homelessness has soared in Phoenix, this council has had to make strong policy decisions regarding housing and homelessness and in order to try to keep people off the street, but also, once they find themselves there, to move them into transitional housing and then permanent housing. Right to council could be a critical step in addressing homelessness at the root, research on pilot programs has been clear that by providing this service, you create strong common sense policy that will be a savings to the city. It's heartening to hear that so many people in the audience today, and so many of the people here are strong advocates for right to counsel. It's particularly heartening considering that when we put these barriers into who can access right to counsel, we end up shooting ourselves in the foot. 200% of the federal poverty line is only $30,000 a year, or just over $30,000 a year for a single adult.

I understand you're facing strong budgetary concerns. I also understand that we are needing. We need to fight this holistically as a community if we want to make a difference. Thank you for your time. Thank you very much. I have Charlie. Hi, my name is Charlie Shapurger, and I'm here to voice the need of a right to counsel in our community. I'm testifying today on behalf of a family. In our family, we have a young adult who has been diagnosed with manic depressive and like many, many with this horrible disease, he doesn't like the medication, so he doesn't consistently take it. His parents have tried to help him to get and to keep housing, only to be told that he's an adult. He's 18 to 20, I'm not sure of the year, and that they're not allowed to interfere because he's an adult. When the young man comes home to live at home after discharge from an emergency department, he runs away and winds up back on the streets where he can't get housing because he lost his job or was evicted. So, you know, it's a vicious cycle. How can we help him learn as a new adult how to find help? There are so many people struggling with mental health issues, and many of them end up in eviction court. Through a right to counsel program, you could create a necessary protection for this community that they have appropriate legal assistance for him and for others who have mental health challenges when they get into an eviction court. Thank you for bringing the possibility of this program into conversation, because we really need it. Thank you. Thank you. Sebastian del Portillo. Hello. Good morning, members of the committee. It's with joy today that I'm here as part of the take back our homes campaign in support of right to counsel program in Phoenix. I want to thank Pam for all the work she does every day, Susan and Gina for the presentation, and Yasemin for her active role in this policy. I also want to thank all of our community members here and online who've shown up to advocate for this today. You've heard the statistics of the program. They're really outstanding. You know, I want to name that. Everything that the city does requires funding, but this should not be viewed as a spending program or framed as a spending program. This is a savings program for the city where we're preventing things upstream to spend less downstream in our housing system. And we meet in our campaign people across the city every single day. And I can tell you almost every day we talk to someone who is being evicted, is behind on the rent or is already evicted. A couple of weeks ago, we were there with Nancy, who you heard from today in court supporting her. She was able to avoid and delay her eviction, but other people in that courtroom did not have the same chance. We saw people be misguided. They were given false hope. They left the courtroom without truly understanding what their situation was. And the fact was that they were going to be locked up, out or forcibly removed in as little as seven days. One of the people that really impacted us was a mom with her newborn baby in her hands and she didn't speak English. And she just walked out of that room not knowing what happened. So an attorney, attorney in court provides tenants just a fair court proceeding with the existing laws. This is not a crazy policy. We're just asking for people to have a chance in court. Right now, evictions are trending to be higher than last year and we need to do something. I agree with Morningstar. We need to expand this program, be as inclusive as possible. And now you'll see that other cities have drafted this ordinance and allowed the city itself time to catch up with its goals. But we really do need a right to council ordinance to protect our community from this process. Thank you, Bashin. Thank you very much. Next we have Noel Lewis. Hello, everyone, chairman and subcommittee members. My name is Noeli Alicia and I'm an indigenous woman as well as a melanated woman here residing in Phoenix, Arizona. I've been here for going on four years. And I've been able to witness beautiful things happen in my personal journey, as well as being committed to community outreach. And I'm standing here, as in representation of the statistics, what it looks like to be melanated, single, a woman, and also someone who has experience being evicted. I was evicted November 2023.

Next we have Noel Lewis. Hello, everyone, chairman and subcommittee members. My name is Noeli Alicia and I'm an indigenous woman as well as a melanated woman here residing in Phoenix, Arizona. I've been here for going on four years. And I've been able to witness beautiful things happen in my personal journey, as well as being committed to community outreach. And I'm standing here, as in representation of the statistics, what it looks like to be melanated, single, a woman, and also someone who has experience being evicted. I was evicted November 2023. And I know what it feels like, personally, to feel neglected by your society, by your community, by the city, not being able to be heard, feeling like you're just a number and a check that's coming into your rental property. I personally know what it knows what it feels like to have a member of the police department, as well as your management who wasn't willing to talk to you, come to knock on your door to evict you and tell you you only have an hour to get whatever you need to leave your space, and for it to be so impersonal and so inhumane. I experienced being in a car accident in 2022 of August, which put me in a life process of going to therapy for a year, of physical therapy and trauma therapy for a year. And then in August of 2023, four months before my eviction, I experienced the grief of my maternal figure passing. So, with that, I was in a very fragile mental state, as well as just having to think and worry about where I was going to have to live. So I would love for us to take the time to get into our heart space and really push for the right to counsel, because we're all human, and this is a part of our rights. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. Next. Danielle Witcher. Danielle? Good morning. My name is Danielle Witcher. It's an honor to be here in front of you. I'm here to ask for counsel for this to be passed, because if we do need this, this, it was saved. I come from. I heard. I was glad to hear, let me say toledo, ohio. I come from Toledo, Ohio. I have seen how this has done, and this will save the city a lot of money. It would help keep the homeless down and people into their home, where we give legal limitations to everybody else that's being incarcerated and going through the legal system. This is a legal procedure, and counsel needs to be present. Thank you. Thank you very much. Last speaker of the day is Evelyn Castillo. Evelyn, I'm so sorry I lost my place. Good morning, everyone. My name is Evelyn Rodas Castillo. I am the field organizer with take back our homes campaign and unemployed workers united. I'm here today asking Phoenix City Council to pass an ordinance enacting a right to council program, and we support the city in finding funding for this program. I grew up my whole life with instability because of the lack of affordable housing here in Arizona. I experienced homelessness for the first time at seven years old, and I lost track of the homes I stayed in. By the time I was 14, my single mother of three was our only provider. She had a lot of health issues, so when she couldn't work, we weren't able to make rent, which led us to face numerous evictions. We lived in our car at one point and were separated as a family because we often didn't have a place to live, leaving us in this endless cycle of poverty. Unfortunately, my story is not unique. The housing crisis is only getting worse, causing the size of the unsheltered population to hit record numbers. We have one of the fastest eviction processes in the country. Not having an attorney is a huge factor in this problem and leaves tenants with no protections against evictions that may not be lawful rent control. And strong tenant protections, like a right to counsel, can help slow the crisis down by keeping more families in their homes. We have a much bigger fight when it comes to affordable housing. More must be done in order to ensure families and neighbors stay housed in the communities to which they belong. As humans, we all deserve the preservations of our homes and a safe and dignified place to live. As a city, it is up to us and you all at council to uphold this value. Thank you so much for this time and for listening to our stories. Thank you very much. There's all the list of speakers I had, so. All right, councilmember, I also registered to speak. Sorry, did we. Was it okay? Go ahead. All right, aim, give us information. Thank you. Thank you again. My name is Luke Black. I am an organizer with poet in action, representing the Pueblos budget in support of right to legal counsel for folks that are facing eviction. I would like to just really quickly tell my own story. I am a renter here in Phoenix. The current location that I've been at, I am in my fourth year there. I've had four leases with them. About a month ago, I bought a grill for my apartment and had it out on my patio and received a text message from my landlord telling me that I needed to have it removed. The next day, I got a follow up text message from my landlord telling me that I had not removed the grill and that they were beginning eviction procedures. Less than 24 hours and I was already being threatened with eviction. Four years I've rented with them. This is not uncommon. Right. And we continue to find it's. There's legal representation issues. There's literally also just life issues, like people cannot take off work to go represent, to be a part of legal proceedings. And landlords know that we are in a predatory landlord market. Right. They are taking advantage of renters all the time. All the time. And this right to counsel is a positive, proactive step that this council can take to prevent people that are renters from being taken advantage of in this city. And it is one that is easily fundable. And I would like to just speak to y'all's access to $80 million that was presented yesterday in the general fund.

I understand they are here to keep the city moving in a very stable manner. But you all are brought in as our representatives to think proactively, to take proactive steps to reduce the harm that our communities are experiencing. And you all have access to funding. The city manager, it's his job to figure out how to pay for this using the general funds, but you all can direct him to finance this program using that funding. So I would encourage you to do that. And thank you for thinking through and taking time to support legal right to council. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, panel, thank you very much. We will move on. Item eight is up next. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Councilwoman Hodgewatch. Before we separate, I wanted to add, based on the comments that we received from councils, sorry. From our public, I wanted to make sure we followed up on two things. One, we recently extended some fund into our teap program, so it included, I think it's now $1.3 million, and it's anticipated to last us through December 31 of this year. And I trust that if there is a shortfall, we will get a. That you will bring that back to the subcommittee as well as council for potential extension of that fund. And I think I agree with the speakers. It is one of the tools that the city can use to help address in our homeless crisis and to ensure that we don't continue to increase that number. And then two, I also wanted to ask, as we consider this, moving this forward, if we could present some proposals that maybe address. Not the. We would, of course. I mean, our current is 200% of the federal poverty limit. I would ask that we consider additional levels and what that budgetary impact would be to the city. So we can consider that. And looking, as you look into private funding for this program. I would also ask that we look at some of the other funding that we've seen in other cities. For example, Detroit has was able to move forward with private funding and I just think we need to make sure we expand the scope of the areas that we are looking into when it comes to potential funding for this program as well. So thank you so much. Okay, item eight is next. Neighborhood services department will discuss the city's abandoned shopping cart program. I see Spencer self, neighborhood services director, and Anna Marie Ortega, deputy neighborhood services director, at the table. So the floor is yours. Thank you, mister chair and members of the subcommittee, today we are here to present an update on our abandoned shopping cart program. In the interest of expediency, I will be providing the presentation, but I do have Anna Maria Ortega, our deputy director over our neighborhood preservation division, in case you have any particularly difficult questions that I can answer. All right. The abandoned shopping cart retrieval program was established in 2000 2007 to address increasing resident concerns regarding hazards to pedestrians and motorists and visual blight in neighborhoods. It was originally designed to be fully cost recovery through the revenue collected from a $20 per cart fee that was billed to retailers that did not have their own shopping cart retrieval contracts. At that time, few retailers had contracted services in place to retrieve carts taken from their business and and the fee was seen as a tool to encourage retailers to implement measures to prevent carts from being removed and to retrieve them when they are in 2012, city council approved NSD's request to increase the cart retrieval fee from twenty dollars to twenty five dollars to maintain full cost recovery. Over the next five years, the total number of carts stabilized while the number of billable carts decreased. In fact, between 2012 and 2017, the number of carts retrieved for retailers with their own contracts increased from fewer than 32% to more than 94% of the carts collected. As a result, NSD requested city council approve approval to eliminate the full cost recovery model and to increase the cart retrieval fee from dollar 25 to dollar 50. In addition, our vendor increased their fees and began to charge for those carts returned to retailers with their own cartridges retrieval contracts. Since 2017, NSD has continued to see an increase in the number of abandoned shopping carts reported and retrieved year after year, ballooning from around 3000 in 2017 to more than 8000 in 2022. And while the percentage of carts retrieved from retailers with their own cart retrieval contracts remained high at around 92% in 2022, the contract costs to the city have more than doubled in those short five years, from 21,488 to 48,875 in other words, despite having their own shopping cart retrieval contracts, more of their shopping carts are ending up in our streets, where the city's contract is stepping in to make the returns at our cost. To help push those retailers to take additional steps, either by increasing their own coll", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City Government", "insights": [{"observation": "Landlords know that we are in a predatory landlord market.

To help push those retailers to take additional steps, either by increasing their own collection services or implementing additional measures to prevent carts from leaving their property and to help defray the increased cost of collection, staff is recommending expanding the abandoned shopping cart retrieval fee to include those carts at a discounted rate. Rather than paying the $50 fee charged to retailers without their own contract, we're proposing $25, a 50% discount for those that do have their own contract. In order to do so, we must negotiate an amendment to our existing contract with our vendor, Arizona Cart services. Which is why today we're requesting subcommittee recommend city council approval for NSD to negotiate to amend their contract to include a cart retrieval fee for retailers with established cart retrieval contracts. Thank you, Spencer. Thank you very much for the presentation. And do any of my colleagues have any additional questions or comments? That being the case, do I have a motion? Motion to approve? Is there a second? 2nd? Have a motion and a second. All those in favor say aye. Chair votes aye. Passes. Thank you very much. Really appreciate your expediency on that. Okay, next, we'll welcome, I was going to say Chris Mackey. I don't see Chris walking up, but I do see Xander Keating and Eric Johnson coming to the table. So with that, the floor is yours. Good morning, mister chairman. Members of the subcommittee. With me today is Zannon Keating, deputy director, who will walk you through our proposed expansion for the enhanced municipal services district to include the rest of our bioscience campus. Thank you, Mister Johnson, Chairman Robinson, members of the subcommittee. So first we'd like to start with a little bit, a brief history of the enhanced municipal services district. You can see the existing boundary on the screen there. This is a district that was established in 1990 at the request of the property owners within the district. It provides enhanced services within the district. Think the ambassadors in the orange shirts that you see downtown. They do a number of business outreach efforts. They do a lot of marketing and events, and then they also do the clean and green programs, graffiti removal, all of those sorts of things. Devni Marley, who's the president and CEO of Downtown Phoenix, Inc. Is here with us today in case you have any additional questions on those particular services. Because downtown Phoenix, Inc. Is the city service provider for the enhanced municipal services district, the services that are provided within the district are determined by the stakeholders, and that comes from a district board that is made up of a variety of different stakeholders within the district, and they're really who make those decisions and recommendations about what services should be provided within the district. All assessments that go towards funding the district are paid by property owners. So the proposed updates and expansion of the enhancements of civil services district, you can see the red bounded area on the map there. That's the expanded area. The reason the city is moving forward with this is at the request of those property owners, but it's also to bring the rest of the Phoenix biomedical campus into the district. The white dashed line you see on the map, that is the boundaries of the Phoenix Biosciences core, formerly known as the biomedical campus. And when the enhanced municipal services district was created, there was no PBC Biosciences corps, but the area that was created for that went across the boundary line and the northern portion was not within the enhanced municipal services district. We're here today to rectify that and bring the rest of the Phoenix a recommendation to bring the rest of the Phoenix Biomedical Biosciences Corps into the enhanced municipal services district. There are no private property owners within the expanded area. They are all government owned. There's four property owners. There's the city of Phoenix. There's Arizona State University. There's University of Arizona. And then there's the Phoenix Union High School district that own all of those property owners at the city council's preference, they have the ability, through the resolution, to exempt government entities from paying assessments within the district. And our recommendation would be to exempt the high school district from the assessments because they're really not receiving any benefit from the district. But all the other property owners certainly receive significant benefit, and we'd recommend that they are all included within the district. Mister Rick Daymark, who's with Arizona State University, is here with us today as well, in case you have any questions for one of the stakeholders that's within this particular area. So the estimated financial impacts, ultimately, the impacts will be put into a budget that the city council reviews on an annual basis, and so you'll see those total and final impacts later this year.

And then there's the Phoenix Union High School district that own all of those property owners at the city council's preference, they have the ability, through the resolution, to exempt government entities from paying assessments within the district. And our recommendation would be to exempt the high school district from the assessments because they're really not receiving any benefit from the district. But all the other property owners certainly receive significant benefit, and we'd recommend that they are all included within the district. Mister Rick Daymark, who's with Arizona State University, is here with us today as well, in case you have any questions for one of the stakeholders that's within this particular area. So the estimated financial impacts, ultimately, the impacts will be put into a budget that the city council reviews on an annual basis, and so you'll see those total and final impacts later this year. Assuming that city council does decide to move forward with this action, but based on previous year's budgets, the estimated impacts, you can see them before you. For the city of Phoenix, it's approximately $51,762.15. Ultimately, as the rest of the campus is developed by our partners, that assessment that the city is responsible for would go down because it would become our partner's responsibility for those particular parcels as it's developed there is no general fund impact to that amount. Those properties are currently owned by the City of Phoenix. They're within our bio program. And so the city has a fund that's funded through other leases that the city has on the campus that would pay for those amounts. So the community outreach, we did do quite a bit of community outreach for this process to make sure our stakeholders and our neighborhood groups were okay with what we were doing and understood the reasons behind this. We met with all the stakeholders on the campus, obviously the Arizona State University, University of Arizona, the Bioscience High School, and then met with other community groups as well, downtown Voices Coalition, Central City Village Planning Committee, the Evans Churchill Neighborhood association. So next steps. We obviously are here today before the economic development and housing subcommittee. If the subcommittee decides to move this forward to city council, we would appear before them next month in April. But the effective date of this amendment, it won't actually go into the district until January 2025. This puts this into place where we would then be able to include it within that budget process. That takes approximately about six months. We'll be starting that process in May of this year, and it goes through about November of the year. Thank you, Zanden. And with that, we recommend the city council approval of the expansion of the enhanced municipal services district boundary. Thank you. Thank you for the presentation. I'd like to open the floor for additional questions or comments by my colleagues. None. Okay. If not, do I have a motion move to approve 2nd? 2nd all those in favor say aye. Aye. Chair votes aye. Motion carries. Thank you very much. And the next item, we moved to our final action item of the day, and it is item number ten. Lissette Hogans is going to be presenting along with Eric Johnson. So the floor is yours. Thank you, chairman. Members of the subcommittee, as you mentioned, Lisetta Hogan's, our deputy director, is with us to give an overview of our Phoenix youth Rise program and our request to accept funding to continue the program efforts. Thank you so much, Eric. Chairman, councilwoman, it's a pleasure to be here with you this morning. I'm going to just briefly go through our presentation here just to kick it off to give you some background on the Phoenix youth Rise program. So the summer youth workforce Experience program was actually originally adopted by mayor and council in May of 2006. And since its up, since its inception, funding for the program has fluctuated from being funded through the Citys Community Development Block grant funds, general funds, and also leveraged through the Workforce Innovation Opportunity act, federal funding, and also from private partners. In 2014, the program changed from the summer youth work experience to the Phoenix Youth Reach investment in summer employment, also known as Phoenix Rise program. As a part of the budgeting process. Apologies. As a part of the budgeting process, council has allocated $250,000 towards the RIsE program. So during the summer, the RisE program provides short term employment to Phoenix youth between the ages of 16 to 24 years old. Last summer, when we had the RisE program, we were able to provide employment opportunities to 127 youth and actually had them placed at 84 unique work sites. In 2021, Phoenix Parks foundation was invited to apply for grant funding annually by JPMorgan Chase in support of the Rice program. Through a letter of agreement between our department, Community and Economic Development and the foundation, the foundation will be able to apply for grant funding opportunities and also receive and distribute funding to CED in support of Rise, our program. This year, we're going to actually partner with our existing youth workforce service providers to implement this program. So neighborhood ministries and the YMCA will be responsible for recruiting and training employers, establishing 50 worksite locations across Phoenix to enhance accessibility and reduce transportation challenges for participants. And then also they'll be reviewing up to 176 participant applications for eligibility and suitability of the Phoenix Rice program. Part of their role will also be to prepare these youth for work readiness, training and support services, and also help them in completing their goals. They're going to place participants in a paid internship experience with local employers for four weeks, and these youth will be working 80 hours a we", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "Community outreach, meeting with various stakeholders and neighborhood groups.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The city has a fund that's funded through other leases that the city has on the campus that would pay for those amounts.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Phoenix Union High School District", "insights": [{"observation": "Recommendation to exempt the high school district from assessments as they are not receiving any benefit from the district.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}]}, {"name": "Arizona State University", "insights": [{"observation": "Involvement in community outreach and stakeholder meetings.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Phoenix Youth Rise Program", "insights": [{"observation": "Program provides short-term employment to Phoenix youth between the ages of 16 to 24.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Partnership with neighborhood ministries and the YMCA to implement the program.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "JP Morgan Chase provides grant funding support for the program.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Establishing 50 worksite locations across Phoenix to enhance accessibility and reduce transportation challenges.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "Community outreach, meeting with various stakeholders and neighborhood groups.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The city has a fund that's funded through other leases that the city has on the campus that would pay for those amounts.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Phoenix Union High School District", "insights": [{"observation": "Recommendation to exempt the high school district from assessments as they are not receiving any benefit from the district.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}]}, {"name": "Arizona State University", "insights": [{"observation": "Involvement in community outreach and stakeholder meetings.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Phoenix Youth Rise Program", "insights": [{"observation": "Program provides short-term employment to Phoenix youth between the ages of 16 to 24.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Partnership with neighborhood ministries and the YMCA to implement the program.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "JP Morgan Chase provides grant funding support for the program.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Establishing 50 worksite locations across Phoenix to enhance accessibility and reduce transportation challenges.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 6843134, "chunk_end_time": 7261794, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/px9yBaMPnf8", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/px9yBaMPnf8?t=6843s"}, {"start": 104000, "end": 110000, "text": "department, Community and Economic Development and the foundation, the foundation will be able to apply for grant funding opportunities and also receive and distribute funding to CED in support of Rise, our program.

And with that, I'll turn it back over to Eric for a recommendation.

We are celebrating the birthday of Councilwoman Guardado and congratulations to Councilman Robinson who will be serving as grand marshal of the Awatuki Easter parade this weekend. And while we're celebrating, Arizona forward held their environmental excellence awards. In the last week. Our planning and development department was recognized for their solar work, aviation for their green curb, and the Office of Sustainability for their solar for low income homes. And the winner of the Crescorti award, which is the highest award, was public works for their work with young people around composting and food waste. So thank you to all of our departments for their great work. I think the big celebration today though, is to celebrate the work of councilwoman and sorry, it is her last official council meeting. Thank you for your diligent work. Over the last three years, she has helped us become a better city and shed light on many important issues. That includes fighting gun violence, ending income discrimination for renters, developing solutions to address the homelessness crisis, supporting new strategies to mitigate extreme heat, and much more. And today we will take steps on an important worker safety ordinance ahead of summer, another effort with which she was deeply involved. She has been a strong presence in our community from levine to downtown, and has partnered with local organizations to bring together her district in fun, creative ways. Thank you for your impactful tenure and wishing you the best as you take your next step. I understand the International Rescue Committee is here and would like to recognize the councilwoman with a token of their appreciation. So I don't know if you want to, if you would be willing to go down on behalf of the international Rescue Committee, Arizona State University, Luther and social services, and all of our refugee communities. This is just a small token of our gratitude for the amazing work that you have done and the impact that you've had on so many lives. So thank you very much. Thank you so much for all your support for the refugee community in number of LSS, Southwest Lutheran social services. Thank you. Yeah, there's also ASU and we'll take a picture afterwards. Great. This is so sweet. Thank you. Thank you so, so, so much to all of the organizations. That was very, very sweet. Thank you, mayor. I'm much more anxious right now than I thought I would be. My district update will focus on one thing. I just want to say thank you to everyone who has engaged with and assisted my district seven team in helping build a better phoenix during my time in office. I'm extremely, extremely proud of how we ran our office and more importantly, the people first policies that we championed and delivered. I think a lot of that has to do with hiring a young, diverse, energetic team. While I became the youngest woman ever elected to the Phoenix City council at 28, if you can believe it, everyone who I hired on my team was younger than me. And I want to thank Maria, erin, Morgan, Jocelyn and the many interns and staff members who joined us for heat relief shifts at the zone. Covid-19 oh my gosh, this is so embarrassing. Covid-19 vaccination efforts, door to door canvassing for the go bond and empowered residents to take an active role in shaping our neighborhoods. I'm also grateful to be able to serve alongside such needed voices on the council, women, parents, teachers, police officers, city planners, attorneys and labor leaders. Happy birthday to Councilwoman Guardado. We are reflective of the growing diversity in the fifth largest and fastest growing city in the country. And we are thoughtfully responding to the priorities that voters have outlined for us, taking climate action, solving our housing and homelessness crisis, and improving community safety.

Thank you to the IRC and ASU for the acknowledgement and their ongoing partnership in helping to establish the city's first office of refugee support and even fun multicultural events like Noru's that my office held annually. We are in a truly transformative period here in the city of Phoenix and for passionate people who care about being part of our city's evolving identity. I ask you to continue to invest in Phoenix. Show up to council meetings and call in every time. Like Mark Rodriguez, email your council member your ideas, meet your neighbors, and organize and run for office. We are such an accessible body and it's really amazing how quickly change can happen here. I won't be a stranger, and I will continue to stay in touch with the incredibly talented employees we have here at the city of Phoenix. Thank you all so much. I look forward to the opportunity to serve Phoenicians in the year ahead. Thank you. Years ahead. Thank you, councilwoman. Additional council updates or comments. Councilwoman Guardado? Thank you, mayor. So I also want to start by wishing councilwoman Ansari the best of luck on your next adventure. I'm sure you will be incredibly successful in whatever it is that you are doing next. We've done a lot. I think when you came into the council, we were in the middle and trying to figure out a pandemic, a pandemic that none of us asked for. And we worked on so many things together, you know, making sure that a lot of the money went to our communities, putting money into homelessness, trying to pass a pervading wage, and then being very successful at it. I know that it was not easy. I know that it was a huge learning curve for all of us. And I think, you know, in particular, you and I learned a lot together because even though I had already been on the console for a year, I think we all came in trying to figure out how was it that we were going to put money into our communities, into our working class folks that we have and that we both represent. We both neighbor our districts, and we did a lot of work together. We were able to pass a lot of policies, start a lot of new offices for the city of Phoenix. And one of those items we're voting on today that we've worked on for such a long time. So, yes, you will be missed. There is a lot more work to be done here in the city of Phoenix. But wherever it is that you go, I'm sure we'll be in touch and we'll continue to work together. Thank you for all. Thank you for your service. Councilwoman pastor. I actually have policy slides, so, and I don't know, are we doing slides? Are we? I just didn't know. Sorry. I just wanted to wish Betty a happy birthday or councilwoman Guardado a happy birthday. Here are some of the pictures that we have highlighted. Some of many of the things that we have done together. So happy birthday, Councilwoman Guardado. Next slide one over right there. Council members Thelda Williams and Daniel Valenzuela and I began working to combat the issues of 27th Avenue almost ten years ago. The newly unveiled real time operations center at Cactus park precincts will serve as a hub for the state of the art technology, including gunshot detectors and license plate readers, that will be used to assist the Phoenix Police Department in their efforts. As you can see, it was councilwoman Guardado and councilwoman O'Brien and I that joined together to finish off, to finish off the project. But it's not finished. It'll still continue, but to make sure that it is happening. So thank you to my colleagues. Michael Carbajal grew up in Garfield during some of the roughest decades in Phoenix.

It is Councilwoman Ansari's last meeting on council councilwoman Ansari, thank you for your service to the city. With your vote, we were able to pass some progressive policies which the city had never seen in a very long time, so it's a great gratitude of thank you for doing that and we will vote on one today. Recent examples include the prevailing wage, source of income, and short term rental ordinances. I wish you the best in the future endeavors. I know Mark Rodriguez will miss you as well. We may need to adopt him as the honorary district four constituent for for a time being. All right, Mark, district four, you need to contact my office. Please contact me. Thank you very much. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman O'Brien thank you, mayor. As councilwoman, pastor talked about it, we're very excited that the real time operations center is officially open at the Cactus park precinct. The operations center uses cutting edge technology to keep our streets and neighborhoods saf safe. Expanded along the 27th Avenue corridor and beyond Metro center, the officers at Cactus Park Precinct will have access to point and zoom cameras, license plate readers, and gunshot detectors. Already, this technology is providing or proving to be incredibly helpful in solving crimes that may have otherwise gone unsolved. One instance in particular was a shooting that took place in my district. While they were able to locate the victim at the scene, due to the gunshot detectors, the suspect had already fled. Our specialists at Cactus park were able to access the technology, identify the suspect at the time the shooting took place, and they were able to follow the suspect to give information to our officers so that they could find them. This technology is going to save lives and protect our communities and officers. I've always been a strong supporter of ensuring our officers have the most up to date technology, which is why I fought to get them drones and why I'm excited to stand with my colleagues in approving the real time operations center. Speaking of technology, I had a meeting on Monday with ASU to learn more about artificial intelligence and how ASU is using it to increase their productivity and inquired how Phoenix can also use this emerging technology to increase our ability to serve our residents. And I believe the mayor participated in an event related to smart city summit and excited to support support for taking Phoenix into not just the next century, but in some spots, the current century. I'm hopeful that we as a council will continue to learn more about how we can increase our productivity using this technology and that we take forward steps in integrating this technology. Last week was crazy busy. We had Saturday morning Village Meadows neighborhood had its first ever flea fest in their neighborhood, including petting zoo, food trucks and a flea market filled with local residents. We also had a hopping explorers at both Buff Community center and Paseo Highland parks that was filled event filled with families and kids participating in coloring contests, egg hunts and pictures with the Easter bunny. Deer Valley at the Deer Valley park, we had the Black Mountain Community alliance for their excellent adventure.

Over 150 kids hunted for golden eggs, made easter crafts and took photos in the bunny huts. Later that afternoon, I was fortunate to get to take off my councilwoman hat and put on my mimi hat to celebrate my granddaughter Riley's first birthday. So I cannot believe it's been a year since I had to step away from the dais and head to the hospital to be there when she was born. Sunday I got to join the mayor, Councilwoman Hajj Washington, Councilwoman Ansari, and close to 2000 folks at the largest plated event in Arizona, fresh brunch supporting one in ten's mission to supplying a safe environment for all lgbt youth. To top it off, last night we were able to celebrate or have our community meeting at Barrio Brewing Company at Deer Valley Airport, where budget director Amber Williamson joined us to talk about the upcoming budget, our future deficits that we will face as an entire city thanks to some poor decision making at the state legislature over the last couple of years. And finally, I would like to thank Councilwoman Ansari for her service not only to her district, but to the entire city of Phoenix. Best of luck in your future endeavors. We'll go to Councilwoman Hunt Washington and then back to Councilwoman Guardado. Thank you so much. Mayor D Eight has also been pretty busy last couple of weeks. We started off I'll go start with Saturday. We had the opportunity to open a new park in Levine. Harvest park was well received, a neighborhood park that the community so desperately wanted and was there to support. We also participated in the Levine Youth Talent showcase, the first annual where we saw the many talents of our young individuals, from dancing, singing to ventral eloquence and so much more. As councilwoman pastor mentioned, last week we celebrated renaming of a street in honor of a local legend, Michael Carbajal. And tomorrow we will celebrate the renaming of another street in honor of another local hero, Vernell Myers Coleman. Yesterday I had the opportunity to fellowship and speak with the ladies at the Latino Leadership conversation where we stressed the importance of education for our in our minority communities, for people of color. And I continue to continue to look for more opportunities of how we can serve all members of our community. I too wanted to say good luck and best wishes to Councilman Ansari. I've enjoyed working with you on our quarterly Levine meetings as well as our Gobon outreach. You're leaving big shoes for your successor to fill and good luck on your next steps. Councilwoman Guardado thank you mayor. Just a couple of reminders. Just want to remind everyone that this Saturday, March 30 at Homestead Park, 2602 West Glendale Avenue, we will be hosting it's inaugural Easter jubilee.

I've learned a lot from you, and I'm sorry I was delayed in saying this. We were trying to get me on the phone, but I really appreciate your work for the city and wish you all good luck. Take care. Thank you. Vice Mayor Stark, Mayor Gallego here. Will the city clerk please read the 24 hours paragraph and the title. The title of the following ordinance number on the agenda was available to the public at least 24 hours prior to this council meeting and therefore may be read by title or agenda. Item only, ordinance number G 7241. Item number one is for ordinance G 7241 and ordinance amending chapter 18 of the Phoenix City Code to revise article one, section 18 and add article eleven to address contractor requirements for the mitigation of heat related illnesses and injuries in the workplace. Thank you. So we will hear item number one, which is proposed amendments for mitigation of heat related illnesses and injuries in the workplace. Councilman Ansari has been a great leader on these issues, and I would ask her to introduce the presentation before we turn it over to our staff. Thank you, mayor. Very briefly, I just want to thank all of the workers, council members, and labor leaders who have been advocating for stronger worker protections for years. Extreme heat is Phoenix's natural disaster. We've talked about this before, but Phoenix is on the front lines of climate change, and we will see that in the form of extreme heat. And we have been seeing it. I think everyone here knows last summer we were breaking all sorts of records for the wrong reasons. I'm sure everyone in this room got texts from friends and family across the country asking if Phoenix is gonna be a livable place to live in the years ahead. And I think that summer, and especially all of the workers who brought to our attention the impacts that they were seeing at the workplace, is what has been driving new, renewed urgency to this conversation. I specifically want to shout out SEIU, who came to us with Linda, who's here in the audience, who faced severe heat, illness on the job, and also the ironworkers and other building trades who came forward about issues around construction sites and not having access to water or adequate breaks, et cetera. So thank you for bringing this forward. I'm also very, very grateful to staff. We wanted to immediately figure out what we can do as a first step to start building stronger protections here at the city. Really, thank you to Lori for working with my office on this and for Dave and all of the stakeholder meetings we've done with labor unions and contractors and the rest. And again, I'm looking forward to hearing the presentation. Thank you for taking that input on. And hopefully this will be the first. It's not the first, but the beginning of stronger policies to make sure that Phoenix is prepared to respond to extreme heat that is baked in already to our future. And we need to be able to adapt and to build resilience. So thank you for your work on this. I really, really appreciate it, and I'm proud to be able to hear this on my last policy meeting. Thank you. We'll turn it over to our assistant city manager, Laurie Bayes, to introduce the item and our director of heat response and mitigation. Thank you, Mayor. Members of the council, we're here today to propose amendments to Phoenix City Code Chapter 18 regarding the mitigation of heat related illness and injuries in the workplace. With me today is Doctor David Hondula, director of the city's Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, and I'd like to thank him for his role in this. I'd also like to thank David Matthews and Ashley Lee with HR Kathleen Gitkin and Adriana Phillips with the finance department, multiple department heads, and of course, my management assistant Zach Wallace, who has been integral in developing today's proposal. Today we will cover the impacts of heat on the City of Phoenix, as well as an overview of our comprehensive heat response plan, which you're familiar with. We will also provide a summary of the state emphasis program on workplace safety measures. We will touch on efforts related to what we are doing to protect city employees, and then we will get into the development of the proposed ordinance and the related stakeholder engagement efforts. We will review the key points of the proposed ordinance itself and finally make a recommendation for council consideration. So to start us off, I'll turn it over to Doctor Hondula.

We will review the key points of the proposed ordinance itself and finally make a recommendation for council consideration. So to start us off, I'll turn it over to Doctor Hondula. Thank you, Lori, and good afternoon, mayor and council members. One month ago, we had a good discussion with you about the city's overall heat response plan. That's our comprehensive approach to enhance public health and community resilience by alleviating adverse effects of heat. We shared with you a number of different actions we're taking across these nine strategy areas in which we're improving our plan from previous years, and that included an improved focus on the safety of workers in our city who face heat exposure, as Laurie alluded to. We're back today for a more in depth discussion of that particular topic. At our last presentation, we showed you these numbers, the very troubling rise in heat associated deaths in our region. And while these cases are significant and tragic on their own, for every one of these cases, we know that there are dozens more of heat related medical incidents that require professional care and many more cases of health challenges people experience in their daily lives that don't show up in administrative records. For these reasons and many more, I think it makes good public health sense for us to have a heat response plan, but it also makes good business sense for us to have and implement a heat response plan. Why might that be? For one, research shows us that workers who are not dealing with, recovering from, or worried about heat related illness are more productive on the job. And second, we all see headlines like these each and every summer, as councilwoman Ansari alluded to. How are these headlines interpreted in the minds of talented workers who are thinking about moving here to take a job in one of our growing industries? How are they interpreted in the minds of a real estate investor who's thinking about a new project here? And how do they influence our own residents and workers attitudes about our community and their long term plans about where they live? Preventing heat related illness is so important for public health and quality of life. But I also suggest respectfully, that it is a really important part of our strategy to economically thrive. We are one of just many agencies in Arizona working to mitigate adverse impacts of heat, and we see an accelerating trajectory of investment from partners at other levels of government. We're working hard to be a collaborative partner in those efforts. Some notable milestones in regional and state efforts are shown on the slide here, and we'd like to draw your attention to the last bullet point. Last summer, the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health AdOSH introduced a new state emphasis program, or an SEP, on heat safety, and that SEP is a critical piece of the worker heat safety landscape we need to first understand before recognizing what we as a city can do. As Laurie alluded to, I'd like to acknowledge the hard work of our human resources safety team to help us understand and interpret that SEP as we crafted the ordinance language you see today and to provide a summary of that SCP. I'm pleased to hand the presentation back to our assistant city manager, Lori Bass. Thank you Dave. Mayor and council as you may be aware, there are not currently OSHA standards for employee heat hazards, and historically, heat risk mitigation falls under the OSHA general duty clause, which essentially states that workplaces should be free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause serious harm or death. This is also mirrored in Arizona state statute. Arizona operates under the OSHA approved state plan, so safety and health programs are governed by our state safety agency, the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health, or ADOSH. Last July, AdOSH rolled out a state emphasis program to mitigate heat related illnesses and injuries in the workplace. The SEP gives direction to Arizona employers to focus focus on four key areas to promote safe working conditions and reduce incidents. These are water, rest, shade and written plans. But before we get into the proposed ordinance, I want to tell you a little bit more about what we've done at the city to help ensure that city employees are safe. When the state emphasis program was released last year, the city put in place written heat safety plans for applicable departments that that address the elements of the SEP and the same plan requirements included in the proposed ordinance. Today, we have also created a new administrative regulation or internal policy which ensures compliance with these elements. This demonstrates that we are walking the walk and not requiring things of others that we are not willing to do ourselves. Now onto the reason that we are here before you today, the development of a proposed ordinance regarding the mitigation of heat related illnesses and injuries in the workplace due to the potentially dangerous heat conditions described by Doctor Hondula at the beginning of the presentation and the development of the SEP, interest arose regarding building requirements into t", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "Impacts of heat on the City of Phoenix and comprehensive heat response plan to protect city employees and the broader community.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "State emphasis program on workplace safety measures focusing on mitigating heat-related illnesses and injuries in the workplace, including water, rest, shade, and written plans.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "An increase in heat-associated deaths and medical incidents in Phoenix, indicating a significant public health concern.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Proposed ordinance for mitigating heat-related illnesses and injuries due to dangerous heat conditions in the workplace.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Actions to ensure compliance with state emphasis program elements, including building requirements into internal policies for city departments.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health (ADOSH)", "insights": [{"observation": "Introduction of a new state emphasis program on heat safety, focusing on key areas: water, rest, shade, and written plans, to improve worker heat safety.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "Impacts of heat on the City of Phoenix and comprehensive heat response plan to protect city employees and the broader community.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "State emphasis program on workplace safety measures focusing on mitigating heat-related illnesses and injuries in the workplace, including water, rest, shade, and written plans.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "An increase in heat-associated deaths and medical incidents in Phoenix, indicating a significant public health concern.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Proposed ordinance for mitigating heat-related illnesses and injuries due to dangerous heat conditions in the workplace.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Actions to ensure compliance with state emphasis program elements, including building requirements into internal policies for city departments.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health (ADOSH)", "insights": [{"observation": "Introduction of a new state emphasis program on heat safety, focusing on key areas: water, rest, shade, and written plans, to improve worker heat safety.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1781668, "chunk_end_time": 2136912, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/UXPJgevotio", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/live/UXPJgevotio?t=1781s"}, {"start": 29000, "end": 35000, "text": " proposed ordinance, I want to tell you a little bit more about what we've done at the city to help ensure that city employees are safe.

Now onto the reason that we are here before you today, the development of a proposed ordinance regarding the mitigation of heat related illnesses and injuries in the workplace due to the potentially dangerous heat conditions described by Doctor Hondula at the beginning of the presentation and the development of the SEP, interest arose regarding building requirements into the city code to essentially embed the heat, illness and injury prevention measures into city contracts, including licenses and leases, as well as subcontracts, sublicenses, and subleases. In order to ensure we were developing a proposed ordinance that would successfully address needs from all perspectives, we held a series of stakeholder engagement meetings in February and earlier in March. These meetings included workers, labor organizations, contractors, and relevant associations. Additionally, as you'll recall, there was a discussion about the proposed ordinance at the February 27 policy meeting where the city's heat mitigation plan plan was discussed. All of these discussions and many others in between have informed the proposed ordinance before you today. By and large, support from stakeholders on all sides has been positive and we have done our best to address as many concerns as possible. Something I've learned through many years of labor negotiations is that you usually know you have a good agreement when everyone can live with it, but no one is truly happy. What we bring to you today is the product of a lot of input and a lot of compromise that will hopefully help keep workers safe during the phoenix heat. The proposed ordinance applies to all city contractors, lessees and licensees, as well as their subcontractors, sublicensees, and sublessees who have employees who work in an outdoor environment. It requires them to have a heat safety plan. The city will have access to this plan as well as documentation of all heat safety, safety, and mitigation efforts implemented to prevent heat related injuries and illness in the workplace. The plan must also be posted where it is accessible to employees. At a minimum, the heat safety plans must include these elements availability of cool drinking water free of charge at accessible locations ability to take regular and necessary breaks and breaks for hydration access to shaded areas and or air conditioning access to air conditioning in vehicles within closed cabs acclimatization practices to promote physiological adaptation and training on heat, illness and injury. The primary mechanism for administering the ordinance will be through contract monitoring by existing department contract management staff. They will utilize the provisions within the contract to ensure compliance just like they would with any other term of the contract. If an issue arises, staff will provide a notice to the contractor as well as an opportunity to cure or resolve the issue. If the issue is not resolved, additional measures can be taken up to and including termination of the contract. Additionally, the enforcement agency for Occupational Safety and Health is adosh, so staff will refer to adosh when appropriate. If approved, the ordinance will take effect 30 days after council approval, with the exception of the requirement for functioning air conditioning in vehicles with enclosed cabs that would go into effect May 1 of 2025. There is no need for contract amendments as the provision exists to comply with city code and this would be embedded in city code. So with that, staff requests city council approval of the proposed amendments to Phoenix City code to add article eleven to address contractor requirements for the mitigation of heat related illnesses and injuries in the workplace. We're happy to answer any questions. Thank you so much. Councilwoman Ansari is our acting vice mayor. Would you like to make a motion? I move approval of the proposed ordinance and also direct staff to create a city managers advisory committee made up of representatives of workers, contractors and subcontractors, community members and relevant city staff to assist with advising staff and providing guidelines regarding best practices in heat, injury and illness prevention. Second a motion and a second councilmember comments? We'll begin then. Do you want comments or you want to begin? We can go first. Wonderful.

And if I'm gonna face a situation where I have to quit my job, gracias. Thank you. Linda is next, followed by Lucombo. Hello, everyone. I'm Linda Ressler, a cabin cleaner working for an airline service provider at Phoenix Sky harbor airport. We do more than just clean. We do security searches on passenger seats. Our team cleans the aircraft that remains overnight. We are taken from plane to plane in un air conditioned vans. We then clean the cabins with no air conditioner where the temperatures have reached triple digits. When you're on the tarmac, there are no cooling break rooms with cold running water drinking water. While cleaning cabins, I have had to scavenge for unopened bottles of water left behind by passengers just to stay hydrated. Despite my best efforts, last summer, I experienced severe heat exhaustion and ended up in the hospital. It's a good first step to require that employers who contract with the city put measures in place to protect workers from heat illness, and it is important that the city brings workers to the table to have a voice. But the airlines whose cabins we clean also need to step up and protect workers like us from being injured by the heat. With a deadly summer heat around the corner, someone our employers, the city, or the airlines, where whoever controls our workplace environment needs to do the simple and humane thing and ensure all workers are safe from the heat. I'm proud to be united with people across this city who are fighting for our lives. Rest assured, you will keep hearing from us until we are all protected. Thank you. Thank you. Lucumbo is next, followed by Cecilia Lucumbo Zola. I'm sorry, just to confirm the next speaker is here or not? No. Okay, then we will go to Cecilia, followed by Jordan. Hi, everyone. My name is Cecilia Ortiz. I am a passenger service agent at Phoenix Sky harbor airport. ISIS passengers who need assistance to move around into the airport safely and comfortably. Air travel isn't always the most accommodating for all of our passengers, so I do my best to make it a better experience for everyone that I, that I encounter. But working in the extreme Arizona heat without any real protections or safeguards in place not only makes my job, but all airport service jobs extremely difficult and dangerous. Last summer was the breaking point. I knew I had to step up and speak out on behalf of myself and my coworkers and demand safer working conditions and protections from the heat. It's great to see that the city is finally listening and making an effort to protect working people, but much more work needs to be done. It's great to see. Oh, yeah. Again. It's upsetting, though, that my coworkers like Linda aren't covered and will have to endure the heat again this summer. This is a step in the right direction and one to celebrate, but all workers should be protected. Thank you. Thank you. Jordan is next, followed by Caitlin. Good afternoon, mayor and council. My name is Jordan Greenslade. I'm with unite here, local eleven. We represent workers at Sky harbor airport, especially the sky chef workers that would be affected by this bill. As some of the workers from sky chefs have said, this fight has been going on for many years. Back in 2017, along with other sky chef workers across the country, workers in Phoenix made their voices heard. That year, Forbes magazine reported that sky chef drivers lacked functional air conditioning in their truck, even during the blistering summers. A report by our labor union, Unite here, released that year and noted that in some cases, the company disabled or removed air conditioning units from its trucks. The report found that only about 5% of skyshef drivers reported that their trucks had working air conditioning units. We're really hopeful that with today's vote, these dangerous working conditions will come to an end. In Phoenix, where we experience dangerously high temperatures. It's essential that the city has a comprehensive heat safety program in place that covers workers contracted to perform work at city facilities. And one thing I'll also mention, as we all know, Phoenix is extremely hot.

Back in 2017, along with other sky chef workers across the country, workers in Phoenix made their voices heard. That year, Forbes magazine reported that sky chef drivers lacked functional air conditioning in their truck, even during the blistering summers. A report by our labor union, Unite here, released that year and noted that in some cases, the company disabled or removed air conditioning units from its trucks. The report found that only about 5% of skyshef drivers reported that their trucks had working air conditioning units. We're really hopeful that with today's vote, these dangerous working conditions will come to an end. In Phoenix, where we experience dangerously high temperatures. It's essential that the city has a comprehensive heat safety program in place that covers workers contracted to perform work at city facilities. And one thing I'll also mention, as we all know, Phoenix is extremely hot. But on the tarmac, it gets even hotter. And so many of these workers have had to suffer through this for many years. I hope we can continue to work together to make sure this measure is properly enforced in order to protect workers across the city. I'd also like to extend particular thanks to council member Guardardo, who has stood with workers in this fight since the beginning, and pastor, the council member, pastor, who has been with workers for many years on this fight. And a huge thanks to Councilwoman Ansari for spearheading this effort to get this ordinance to vote. I'd also like to thank the mayor and the rest of the council. We appreciate what it takes to fight for workers that oftentimes are out of sight from the public. And we appreciate you hearing this issue and given it your vote. We ask that you vote yes on this essential ordinance. Thank you. Thank you. Caitlin is next, followed by Mark Rodriguez. Hi, everyone. My name is Caitlin Paradi. I'm a Phoenix resident. I'm a constituent of councilmember Starks, and I'm also speaking today in my capacity as a worker health and safety expert with the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health. So, you know, the folks we've heard from, Linda Cecilia Filiberto, I think their experiences, you know, what they're saying to us is that they're suffering immensely. They've been suffering while working for city of Phoenix contractors and their subs. And that really makes, you know, that makes the case for the simple heat safety requirements that are proposed here today. But as you move to pass those, I did want to share some context for why the role that the city of Phoenix plays in workplace heat safety is so critical. So, heat is deadly for workers, and increasingly so. And while the heat surveillance reports that we rely on from Maricopa county don't identify workplace related heat deaths, we do have strong national information that show that heat stress can kill up to 2000 workers across the US every year and cause an additional 170,000 injuries on job sites. And, you know, workplace injury and illness can often go on to have lifelong consequences for working people and their families. We also know that this is not a toll that's born evenly. So latino workers, black workers, and low wage workers suffer more. And to give just one, I think, very stark example, in the US, we know that heat related deaths are 91% higher for mexican born construction workers than the average for all other construction workers and 51% higher for us born black construction workers than the average for all other construction workers. So this disparity is really profound. And all these data are from a 2023 public citizen report, if folks are interested. It doesn't have to be this way, because really simple interventions work. And we know this from our work to protect workers from heat across the country, workers need water. They need shade and cool air. They need paid rest. They need time to acclimatize, training in languages they understand, and most of all, a real place at the monitoring enforcement table. And that's what we're looking forward to moving forward with next. Thank you. Mark is next, followed by Alana. Hello, Mayor Kate Gallego and members of the Phoenix city council. It's good to hear from you again. This is the second time that I come to this chambers.

Hello, my name is Alana Billingsley and I'm a flight attendant at American Airlines. I wasn't planning on speaking today, but I've been moved to tell you what I've seen on the aircraft with working with these professional people. I have very different jobs than they do, but we are all safety and security professionals that guard the airlines and protect our air. And I want to say that that is something that is nearly impossible to do in the extreme heat that we experience here in Phoenix. Underlying some of the things that you have all heard today. The sky chefs had air conditioning in their vehicles, and somebody took it out. Somebody at their company made that decision that their lives were not that important. What kind of city do you want to manage? A city where these managers are able to hide under anonymity and harm their workers, create these harmful environments that put our safety and security at risk? Or do you want to put your name out there supporting the workers who put their lives on the line to make sure that my airplane is safe, they pack the food. They go through strict security measures to make sure that what they bring on the plane is safe for me and my passengers. They line up on jet bridges that are over 115 degrees in full polyester uniforms with ties and everything out there waiting for us so they can help disabled passengers. And hopefully they don't get sick from the heat because their wages are so low, they cannot afford the hospital bill if they are taken to the hospital. I think it's absolutely disgusting how they've been treated. And I just had to speak up, and I appreciate you all listening. I'm here with a friend of mine that's also a flight attendant with Alaska Airlines, and we are here in support, support of our colleagues that help keep us safe. Thank you all for listening. Thank you. Sebastian will be our next speaker. Good afternoon, council. My name is Sebastian del Portillo. I'm here representing the Take Back our Homes campaign. We are in support of the ordinance presented today. It's exciting to see the city taking steps to provide critical protection for all these workers. I want to thank SCIU worker power, and the other labor allies and their organizing efforts on this issue and the airport workers here today who are sharing what they face every single day. So, as mentioned by Caitlin, it is honestly shocking and appalling that Latinx workers are three times more likely to die from heat stress than other workers, and that 51%, the heat rate or the death rate, is 51% higher for black construction workers on average. That's shocking. We know that many of the workers who face hazardous conditions in this heat have little recourse not showing up to work can be the difference between being able to pay their rising rents or literally be evicted in the city. We also know that the same worker who handles heat all day on the job could go home to a broken AC or deal with heat on other fronts with little legal recourse and practically no enforcement of the existing laws that we have. Many of our workers face exploitation from the labor they provide and the rents that are being demanded from them every single month. Heat is a factor for workers here in Phoenix that has to be eased anywhere we can and why this measure is so important. But all too often, our labor and tenant protections face real shortcomings in the enforcement piece. So what this ordinance could do as a great first step, but I have to urge the council to ensure workers have a real seat at the table in the proposed advisory committee that I heard about. For this work to actually improve the lives of workers, we need the strongest possible accountability for corporations who violate this ordinance, which we know they will, or retaliate against workers for speaking up about violations. So I asked the council to vote yes. Again, thank you for the work that you've done so far, and thank you for the work that remains. Comments thank you. That concludes public comment. We'll turn to council member comments. Councilman Guardado thank you, mayor. I just want to thank staff. Thank you so much, Lori, for all of your hard work on this and all the add ons that we were able to bring forward from AC units into the trucks for skyshef workers and also water fountains for workers as well.

And as we move forward into the days that we celebrate, civil rights and labor movement leaders like Cesar Chavez, I think of his legacy and everything he worked to accomplish and bring to our country, workers and their families. As city leaders, it is our responsibility to take proactive measures to safeguard and empower our workforce in every possible way. Cesar Chavez said, we cannot seek achievement for ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community. None of us get ahead if we don't all get ahead. And that includes for the working people who have built and keep this city running every day. Thank you to all the workers that are here today. The extreme temperatures in Phoenix presents a serious threat to safety and well being of our workers. While this heat mitigation ordinance is a crucial step towards ensuring the protection of our workers, it is essential to recognize that this policy merely establishes a fundamental level of support. Our expectations for contractors and supervisors operating within city facilities must far exceed these basic requirements. Let us view the policies outlined here as the starting point rather than the ultimate standard. We must strive for excellence in safeguarding our workers from extreme heat conditions. Let's make this a top priority. It is time for us to raise the bar and ensure that every worker in Phoenix is provided with the highest level of protection and support. And with that, Lori, I just have one question for you. I know that we had workers, they came up and talked about them having to clean the airplanes in the heat. Is there anything that we can do? Is there a letter that we can write to the FAA? I know that you guys have been looking into it. Is there anything that we can do about that? Mayor, members of the council. Council Menguardado. Yes, we have looked at that issue. There are some jurisdictional challenges with having an ordinance that would impact the inside of an airplane cabin. From our legal staff's opinion. So what we are recommending, there's two things. There is an OSHA rulemaking process in effect that may impact that. We don't know if that's the case or not yet. There's also the prospect, as you mentioned, of writing a letter to. I would recommend writing it to the Department of Transportation. The FAA is under the umbrella of the Department of Transportation and expressing to them why that's important to the, of Phoenix and its workers. So that's something that we could certainly do to help them understand why they may want to do that on their own. That way we don't have to have those jurisdictional challenges that I mentioned. They could just address it on their end. Got it. Thank you. Thank you so much for that. And with that, I just want to thank all the labor groups that are here that are here today. Thank you so much to all of the trade unions that are present here, to SEIU, to worker power, to unite here, UFCW, the Arizona AFL CIO, all of the unions that are present here today. I'm sure I'm missing one or two. Thank you guys so much for being with us today and for holding us accountable. And I'm very happy to be able to support this item today. Thank you, mayor. Thank you, Councilwoman Ansari. Thank you. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions as well. I guess, Bill, that my question is also related to the FAA. The first one. If you could just build off a little bit or explain a little bit more. I know the FAA authorization process is ongoing, and if it turns out that they are indeed covered by OChA and not the FAA, would we be able to add them to an ordinance at a future time? So, mayor, members of the council, Councilwoman Ansari, it is definitely dependent on how things play out and whether or not we can do that. We can certainly continue to evaluate as those processes move forward. And if something changes that does allow it to be within our purview, then we could bring that back to the council at a certain, at a future point. But at this point, it's too early to tell whether or not those things will change and impact our ability to do that. Okay, well, I appreciate that. I hope that staff will continue to monitor this very, very closely. I think the story that we heard from Linda is just one example of suffering heat exhaustion because of the working conditions and planes not having ac running. She was discouraged to take breaks, worried about retaliation, faced retaliation even though she was very ill. So I just hope we'll monitor this as proactively as possible so that if there is an avenue in which we do have that authority, I would like to see us include this in an updated version of this.

In the meantime, as we're conducting some of these other efforts. I think we should absolutely do that. That would be great. Thank you for that. During one of the stakeholders, during one of the major stakeholder meetings that we had with labor that I attended, Caitlin, who spoke today, talked about this. The places that have been most successful in establishing ordinances like this had worker led processes and advisory committees. In the motion we made today, we incorporated something of that sort. Could you just talk about next steps with that city managers advisory committee. Certainly. So typically what we've done. Mayor, members of the council. Sorry. Typically what we've done with those types of advisory committees is we put out a call for applicants of folks who may be interested in participating. We go through a process to select committee members, as you indicated, it would have representation, you know, across the board, and we would then select members of that committee to work with staff to be our subject matter experts, essentially to advise on best practices and guidelines that then could be used as staff is monitoring contracts and as we go through these efforts. So hopefully that's helpful and answers your question. Do you have a timeline on when we would send out those applications? I would say we could get those applications or provided the ordinance passes today, I think we could get the call out within the next 30 days. Okay, thank you. There have also been a few requests that city workers themselves be included in this ordinance. Can you talk a little bit about the work we've been doing to ensure that all of our city departments have strong heat safety plans? Absolutely, mayor, members of the council. Councilman Ansari. We actually started with our own city workers, and when the SEP came out, we instituted plans in each of the departments that has outdoor workers. So each of those departments has a heat safety plan plan. They are now in the process of reviewing those plans for the 2024 season, and they are, you know, going to continue to be augmented as we move forward. We're always learning new practices. Acclimatization is something that's new to us. We're learning, you know, exactly how that works and implementing that in our departments. So we just had a meeting about that and discussed that a little bit this morning as well. Additionally, we have an internal policy which mirrors the ordinance in many ways. And it has all of the same elements that are included in the ordinance, all of the same plan requirements. And it actually goes beyond it just a little bit to indicate that our employees are held to the same standards as what's in the proposed ordinance. Got it. Thank you so much, Lori. Again, I really, really appreciate your work and your entire team's work. Thanks for doing all of the detailed thank yous for us. As I previously stated, extreme heat really is our natural disaster. And I forgot to shout out the mayor, who I believe was the first elected leader, I'm going to say, in the country, to call on FEMA to declare extreme heat a natural disaster, which it is. We're still waiting on that. But there will be a time, if it hasn't hit already that we require more resources from the federal government to be able to tackle extreme heat. I do believe that this ordinance is a very, very important first step and that it will save lives and deliver a happier and healthier workforce in our city. It includes training requirements so that workers and supervisors alike will be able to recognize and report signs and symptoms of heat related illness in themselves and their coworkers. So many heat exhaustion instances and heat stroke cases could have been avoided if that was already happening. I do also want to recognize, I agree that this ordinance should go farther. I really think this is first step, and my hope is that it will continue to be updated as we monitor its effectiveness. Something that I've heard frequently from workers, and several spoke about it today, is about fear of retaliation for taking breaks when they feel unwell from the heat. So my hope is that workers, we. My hope is that if we see that workers are fearful of taking breaks when they need to, even after this ordinance is in place, we will update it to include anti retaliation language. I also, again, just want to give one more shout out to all of the workers and labor unions who are here today, who have voiced support for this ordinance and who have advocated for years for better working conditions.

Thank you, again. Really appreciate it. Councilwoman pastor. Thank you. I have several comments. The Arizona AGC wrote a letter in opposition of this ordinance, and what it states is that the ordinance is redundant and mitigation is already covered under the attached Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health state emphasis program. Could you please elaborate where they feel it's redundant in this ordinance? Yes, mayor, members of the council council, women pastor there are many elements that are, in fact, redundant in this ordinance. In fact, we built the ordinance around the elements of the SEP with the exception of the provision related to having air conditioning in vehicles. That was an addition. However, the piece that the SEP doesn't have is a mechanism for us to administer those same requirements in our contracts, and that's what the ordinance allows for. Okay, so that is, the purpose of this is that we then can monitor and have these regulations now implemented or placed within our own jurisdiction. Yes, mayor, members of the council. Councilman pastor that's accurate. Okay, because I'm just putting it on the record, but elements of this is repeated within our ordinance. However, it's now an ordinance that our contractors and those that we do business with to be making sure that they are following our ordinance. Yes. And other than the big, big picture. Mayor, members of the council, councilwoman, pastor in our stakeholder meetings, in fact, many of the contractors said that it was not going to be an issue for them to comply with this ordinance because they were already doing the things outlined in the ordinance based on the SEP and based on the best practices that they know to be helpful to them. Not every single organization said that, but we did have a majority of the council or the, excuse me, of the contractors who attended our stakeholder meetings, who did express that they were easily able to comply with the elements of the ordinance. Yeah. Cause basically what I'm hearing is they're already practicing what the bigger language, and I think they call it Sep and Adossh. They're already practicing that. It's just now we are putting it into play at the city of Phoenix, and those that are not practicing it are now going to have to practice it. That's basically how I'm reading it and understanding it. Mayor, members of the council. Councilman, Pastor I would say that's an accurate summary. Okay. Then it says, furthermore, the occupational safety and health Administration, OSHA is contemplating similar regulations. So my understanding is that if OSHA does put these regulations or build some regulations, OSHA will supersede us. Mayor, members of the council councilwoman, pastor in a nutshell, yes. There's a little bit of a nuance to that in that we have an Arizona state plan, which means that Arizona would have to essentially adopt what OSHA puts out. But there's some technicality to that. But essentially, yes. Okay. I guess to that point is that I would like to see us as a collective, as a city, really be actively involved in with our, and this is where intergovernmental department will come in, really working with our congressional members and our senators to be our voices regarding our heat related issues and how it impacts us, just like how it impacts cities back east. They're opposite of us, but there's impact and there's rules around that. So I think we have to be proactive as a city to push for some regulation, not that the congressional members have been doing it. I think we just need to join and also get other cities to help us join. I think it's very important for us to take the lead. Secondly, my whole thing when I was listening is that really protection of the workers. When the workers do complain, there is retaliation. But it's in very many retaliation can be defined in many different forms. Retaliation could be cutting hours. Retaliation could be putting pressure on you, working longer hours or working more. In extreme conditions, retaliation could be anything that you're wearing the wrong uniform, whatever it is. So retaliation comes in many forms. I want to know what mechanism has been developed in this process to protect the workers so that there is an avenue or a space that they can call or say, I'm being retaliated against because I spoke up. Mayor, members of the council. Councilwoman pastor, we do not have specific retaliation language in the ordinance itself. That's something that came up later in the process, and it was not included in the proposed ordinance.

I want to know what mechanism has been developed in this process to protect the workers so that there is an avenue or a space that they can call or say, I'm being retaliated against because I spoke up. Mayor, members of the council. Councilwoman pastor, we do not have specific retaliation language in the ordinance itself. That's something that came up later in the process, and it was not included in the proposed ordinance. However, it is our expectation that, you know, none of our contractors would retaliate against their employees or, you know, same goes for the subcontractors. Should they, should they complain that the employer is not, is not in compliance with this ordinance? So, you know, we can also bring back to you, as Councilwoman Ansari suggested, some thoughts on how to incorporate that sort of language in the future. The other piece is we can also monitor what types of complaints about retaliation that we get over, you know, the next period of time, and if we, in fact, see that that is a significant concern. But we will, you know, we will need to report back to you on that. I guess my question would be, if I'm one of these workers and I get retaliated against, who do I call? Who takes my, who takes my claim? And I think that's very important in this piece or any pieces. It's not just this piece, and maybe it's a very larger collective conversation of any of subcontractors that are voicing what is happening and retaliation is being done. So I would like to see a mechanism where workers or, and I know they're subcontractors, but a way that then we know what is happening with those companies that are doing the retaliation and mayor, members of the council. Councilwoman pastor, I should clarify that the city mechanism for retaliation related to this particular ordinance is not included. However, there is an existing whistleblower protection provision related to Adosh. And so if a worker did feel retaliated against, they could go to Adosh and express that concern to them, and they have existing provisions that should support them in that. Okay, so you're saying there is a mechanism. They go to a gosh, but it's really, we have the contract with the contractor, and then they have the subcontractors or the workers. They hire the workers. Then where do they go? They go to agosh, but really, technically, they should be coming to the city of Phoenix. So I would like, once again, develop a mechanism or a process so that we're able to at least follow or collect data to be able to show and demonstrate how this is happening and where it is happening. Where is the gap in all of this? And I'm just trying to, I just feel like this is happening across many city contracts, that they're third parties. I consider them third parties or subcontractors, and they don't have an avenue to say, this is what's happening. You've hired these companies or you have a contract with these companies, and we are coming and saying, this is what's happening, and then retaliation happens, and there's no mechanism for them. So I think that's where I'm going. And I would like to see that at some point, it might be at just a different meeting, and somehow it goes across the city of Phoenix. Then from there, I want to go to how do we monitor or audit that proper behavior is happening? So, mayor, members of the council. Councilman pastor, one of the things that we're going to do following this meeting, provided the ordinance is approved, is we are going to work with the finance department on developing guidelines for the contract monitors in order to assist them in ensuring, properly ensuring compliance with the ordinance. Okay. And if there's a violation, what's the, what's the punishment? I guess I should probably should have used a different term, but. So, mayor, consequence, I guess, cause and effect, members of the council. Council impostor. There are already built in processes for contract compliance that we have at the city. That process, you know, starts with a complaint. It starts usually, or some sort of finding or issue that comes to the attention of the contract monitor. The next step would be to conduct an inquiry, look into the situation with the contractor, and then get a response from them. If that response is not satisfactory, then it would move to a formal, formal notice that they are out of compliance with the contract and an opportunity to cure that defect and resolve the situation. If that doesn't occur, then there are additional steps that can be taken, such as suspension of the contract if necessary. There are other sanctions built into some contracts that could be applied all the way up to termination of the contract if it got to that point. Okay, thank you. And one last, one point. The advisory board or this committee, who selects those members and how will it work and how will it be equitable across the board? So, mayor, members of the council. Councilwoman pastor, that process, it's the city manager's advisory committee. And so it would be conducted by the city manager's office. We would have a panel of individuals, individuals who would select the membership, and then we would report back to the council on who was selected through that application process. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Hodge, Washington. Thank you, mayor. Also, thank you to the staff and all the stakeholders for your work on this project.

Thank you, Councilwoman Hodge, Washington. Thank you, mayor. Also, thank you to the staff and all the stakeholders for your work on this project. Summer of 2023 was one for the history books and not necessarily in a good way. I believe that enacting an outdoor worker health heat safety ordinance is important to safeguarding the most vulnerable employees against the increasing threats of extreme heat. Measures like ensuring the availability of cool drinking water free of charge, the ability to take needed breaks and access to shaded areas, and proper training are the right steps. We know that those that fail to plan, plan to fail, and in this case, failure can be the difference between life and death. I believe this ordinance is the right step toward protecting public health, promoting equity and creating a safer, more resilient city for all residents. I do have a couple questions I wanted to ask just because I want to make sure that one regarding the tarmac, as Councilman Betty Guerrado asked regarding inside the airplane, I wanted to clarify whether or not the tarmac, would the proposed ordinance apply to that area, or is that currently within the jurisdiction of the FAA? So, mayor, members of the council. Councilman Hodge, Washington the groundworkers, I believe is how they're referred to, would be covered by this ordinance. It's really the airplanes themselves that are outside of our jurisdiction, and I'll look to Director Mikowski to see if I'm missing anything there. Good afternoon, mayor, council. Council member Hodge, Washington the answer is yes, the tarmac would be in scope for this ordinance. I'm sorry? Tarmac would be in scope for this ordinance. So any employees working on the tarmac would this, this ordinance would apply to them. Thank you so much for that. I also wanted to circle back really briefly on section 18, hyphen 413. That is the monitoring process. The way I understand this is, although it's called a monitoring process, it's more of a complaint driven process. So it's not that the contractor or the city necessarily would be the ones inquiring to determine whether or not they would not be doing an inspection to confirm that each of the contractors has a plan. It's more so if a complaint has been made. Is that correct? So, mayor, members of the council. Councilman Hodge, Washington the way that the ordinance is written is that the plan has to be available to city staff, so we're not asking contractors or subcontractors to send their plans in. That would create a story storage problem for existing staff. However, the plans do have to be accessible to staff, and should there be any sort of concern raised, the first thing that the contract monitoring staff would do would be to ask for the plan and an explanation of how the vendor is following the plan. How many workers do we anticipate to be subject to this ordinance that were otherwise not subject to this? So, mayor, members of the council. Councilman Hodge, Washington that's a great question, and we've been discussing this amongst ourselves and trying to kind of guesstimate how many workers would be impacted by this. This is a very rough number, but we're estimating at least 10,000 workers will be impacted by this ordinance. Thank you. And some of my question has already been started to be answered in your answers to some of my colleagues, but I wanted to talk a little bit about the failure to comply. Who determines the sanctions, the scale of the sanctions, whether or not it is, as you read the ordinance, it starts off with, I think, cancellation. Is there any, can you talk a little bit about the steps that would be taken once a violation has been alleged or determined to have been found? Yes. So, mayor, members of the council. Councilman pastor again, excuse me. Councilwoman Hodge, Washington. I just looked at councilwoman pastor and my brain went there. Sorry. The way that this works is dependent upon the contract itself, so contracts can have different terms within them and different sanctions within them. However, there is an overarching graduated process that would be applied. So the first step in that process would be an inquiry and looking into the situation, asking, asking the contractor for more information and receiving that back. If the response does not satisfy the contract monitor, then the next step would be to move to a formal notice to the contractor that would explain to them that there are concerns about their ability to meet the terms of the contract and ask them to then formally cure that issue. Again, waiting for their response. There's an opportunity to see, do they comply? Do they not comply? If they don't comply, then it could move on to additional sanctions, either specifically outlined within the contract or the general sanctions of suspension or termination of the contract. Just following up the opportunity to cure the ordinance is silent on the timeframe that would be expected to make the necessary changes or the timeframe for Kirin. Can you speak on that? So, mayor, members of the council. Councilman Hodge, Washington I'd actually like to ask our finance department assistant director, Adriana Phillips to come up and speak to that. Mayor, members of the council, the contract monitoring and contract administration. Regarding your question, it is the process that we take.

Again, waiting for their response. There's an opportunity to see, do they comply? Do they not comply? If they don't comply, then it could move on to additional sanctions, either specifically outlined within the contract or the general sanctions of suspension or termination of the contract. Just following up the opportunity to cure the ordinance is silent on the timeframe that would be expected to make the necessary changes or the timeframe for Kirin. Can you speak on that? So, mayor, members of the council. Councilman Hodge, Washington I'd actually like to ask our finance department assistant director, Adriana Phillips to come up and speak to that. Mayor, members of the council, the contract monitoring and contract administration. Regarding your question, it is the process that we take. We follow, we work with the department to identify what the issue is, as Laurie indicated. So we gather information and then we work with the department to identify what the issues are and what the time period is to actually get the contractor to comply with the terms and conditions. So in this case, we would be working with the specific department that has the services needed for the city and identified how long they would have to comply with the terms and conditions. Then we send a notice to the contractor indicating a time period where they have to comply with the terms and conditions of the contract, and then we give them an opportunity to remedy. We work closely with the law department. If those, if within that time period the contractor does not comply, then we proceed with the next level, an escalation of the contract monitoring, which is all the way to termination, suspension and termination of the contract. Thank you for that. The only thing I would add is I think this is important to not only the workers and the than the vendor to understand what that timeframe is without having to wait on an individualized case by case determination. So I do would ask that as we consider some of the, I realize this is our first step, but as we continue to revise this, I think we definitely need to have some clarity and uniformity in the time period for opportunity to cure. Jumping down I have a few more comments I'll go to. Easy one. Section 18 414 has a typo in the first sentence, receive and is spelled incorrectly. So that's an easy one. But section 14, I think, is a little confusing because it uses both permissible and mandatory language regarding additional documentation. Can you explain the intent of that provision, please? Mayor, members of the council? Council Benhodge, Washington the intent of this is really just that. There may be additional documentation outside of the plan that's in place that may demonstrate a vendor's ability to mitigate heat related illness in the workplace. And so we wanted to give the opportunity for them to provide those things, you know, should there be a need, should a complaint arise or should a monitor, you know, find something that they need to ask more questions about? This would give them, give the contractor the opportunity to provide, or actually the contract monitor the opportunity to request those documents from the vendor. So the intent is it's to provide an opportunity to supplement the information to the department if necessary. I'm not sure if I can actually make an amendment to my colleague's motion, but I would recommend that we revise that language to provide, upon request, the contractor shall provide to the department any additional documentation they possess verifying those mitigation efforts. And so if the maker of the motion and the second consider that a friendly, then we could add it to the motion. Can you just repeat one more time the section and the language change? So it is section 1814, hyphen, sorry, 14, hyphen 413. And it is section b, documentation. It reads, currently, in addition to the documents required in subsection a, contractors may be required. So the may and the required, I think, are a little conflicting. So I was proposing that we say in addition to the documents required in subsection a, upon request, contractors shall provide the department any additional documents verifying. And then dot, dot, dot. So it's adding the upon request. Correct. And it takes out the may to make it a shall. So once the request has been made by the department, they shall provide that documentation. Got it. Okay. I'm okay with that. Yeah. Okay. So both the maker of the motion and the second agree it is a friendly amendment. So the motion would include that. And you're okay fixing the spelling mistake? They're both okay fixing the selling mistake. For those of you who don't know, Councilman Hunt Washington is a lawyer. I bet you could have guessed. Thank you. And then my last one, I wanted just to talk a little bit, because we are doing, we're doing something that we have not seen in our, necessarily on the citywide scale done before in Arizona. I wanted us to talk a little bit about the education that's going to be made to our contractors. I know some of them were part of our stakeholder process, but to ensure that it's effective, I think it's helpful for them to know about these requirements. I just want you to give me some insight into that outreach that we plan on doing. Yes, mayor, members of the council, councilwoman Hodge, Washington. All of the contractors that we have, that have outdoor workers were invited to be a part of our stakeholder process. As you mentioned, you know, not all of them participated.

Correct, Mayor all right, any additional comments before we vote? Roll call? I'm sorry. Yes. Guardado. Yes. Hodge Washington. Yes. O'Brien. Mayor, I'd like to explain my vote. Please do. I'm not sure that this ordinance is fully fleshed out. I have some concerns with lack of appeals process for businesses and some of the language in the ordinance being vague. I still feel this is a step in the right direction. And however, I would contend that we could do more to protect construction workers throughout the city and catch up with our neighboring cities and towns by allowing construction worker to start at 05:00 a.m. during summer months as opposed to 06:00 a.m. i want to make sure our construction employees are protected from heat related illness, but that should also include an earlier construction time that can start without a fee based permit process. But with that, I vote yes. Pastor. Yes. And pinkies. Pinkies up. Robinson. Yes. Waring gallego. Yes, passes 70. We will pause for a moment as some individuals were here for item one. Depart. Alright, item two is an update from the Phoenix Industrial Development Authority on the IDA and new market tax credits. We'll turn it over to our deputy city manager, Ginger Spencer. Thank you, mayor. Mayor Gallego, members of the council. Ginger SPEncER, deputy city manager, I'm here with Juan Salgado and we're here to give you an update on item two, which has to deal with the Phoenix IDA. The technical name is the industrial development authority of the city of Phoenix, but it goes by IDA. And in my capacity, I serve as the executive liaison to the Phoenix IDA as well as the PCDIC. And then technical name for PCDIC is the Phoenix Community Development and Investment Corporation, just for individuals who may not be familiar with these two organizations. The Phoenix IDA was established in 2009 as a result of an Arizona state statute. It has nine board members which are appointed by the mayor and council and they oversee private activity bonds. The PCDIC was established in 2002 and this was a result of the federal funds and the program, which is known as the new market tax credits, which were put into place back in 2000, in the year 2000. And so PCDIC was established by the city of Phoenix. It's a nonprofit, 501 again, that went into effect since in 2002. And so with that, I would like to turn the presentation over to the chief executive officer of the Phoenix Ida, Mister Juan Salgado. And then just one last note. I would like to say that the IDA also administers the PCDIC program on behalf of the city. And so with that, I'll turn over to Mister Salgado. Thank you. Can you hear me okay? Good afternoon, deputy city manager Spencer. Thank you for the introduction, mayor and council members, on behalf of the Phoenix Ida board of directors and staff, thank you for inviting us this afternoon. We look forward to hearing your comments and direction. So for today's presentation, I will speak on the following initiatives, key focus areas for the Phoenix Ida highlight a couple of programs in collaboration with city departments and the 2024 priority for the Phoenix IDa, which will be housing. So the Phoenix Ida was approved by the Phoenix City Council in July 1981 as a nonprofit corporation political subdivision of the state of Arizona. Under the guidance of the Arizona IDA act, the mayor and council appoint the nine member board of directors. The Phoenix IDA currently employs 13 professional administrative staff. The organization is self sufficient and does not receive taxpayer funds. The mission of the Phoenix idea is to provide access to funding to benefit underserved communities. Our vision is to be a premier nonprofit community investor known for providing the most innovative, efficient, and highest quality service improving the lives of all Arizonans. So, some background on the private activity bonds the Arizona IDA act legislation was created to encourage private investment in capital projects through the issuance of private activity bonds. As described under the act, idas have the statutory authority to issue such bonds as conduit port transactions. The IDA or its local governing entities have no financial exposure. Since 2009, the Phoenix ID has closed more than $3.4 billion in bond transactions representing 91 projects. Administrative fees to the Phoenix IDA are included in each transaction.

So before you, you have a list of projects that we have closed and funded since 2002. So this list includes five multifamily projects which will add 764 new rental housings for Phoenix residents. There are three non Arizona projects that invested issuer fees into the Phoenix IDA's community development fund, which we'll talk about in the next slide. Mayor just along those lines, thank you very much for your support and approve of the bond issues that have come before you. This next slide is talking about some key community investments that the idea has funded over the years. The first one is the community development fund. Was approved by the board of directors in 2010. The fund was ceded with $100,000. The initial source of funds was from non Arizona projects. As of December 2023, the Phoenix ID has awarded approximately $13 million in grants to nonprofits providing services for Phoenix residents and city departments. The focus areas include affordable housing, youth family development, health, innovation and community development. The Community Development and Investment Corporation PCDIC approved establishing the Verma Annette Pastor Scholarship Fund in February 2010. The fund is administered by the Arizona Community foundation. Scholarships are available to qualified students attending ASU or America community colleges. As of December 2023, there have been 322 scholarships have been awarded for a total amount of approximately $1.7 million. Special appreciation of the pastor family for allowing us to use their name on the scholarship fund. The Community Development Impact Fund was established by the Phoenix IDA to provide short term real estate secured loans for non profit organizations and for profit companies investing in vulnerable communities. Loans are made in collaboration with community banks and nonprofit community lenders. In the next couple of slides, we'll describe a couple of initiatives that we were involved with the city over the last couple of years. The first one is the mobile home park emergency support in July 2022, Councilman Garcia contacted me seeking assistance for residents of Las Casitas Mobile Home home park that were being evicted by investors seeking to develop the land for other uses. We were invited to attend a meeting with residents that included several nonprofit organizations and the city of Phoenix employees led by Deputy city Manager Gina Montez. Over the next 18 months, the city asked us to assist with Weldon Court and periwinkle mobile home parks. The Phoenix Ida led negotiations with owners of Las Casitas. With dedicated staff, we engage the navigation Consultants private council coordinated assistance with state agency. With much gratitude, I would like to publicly thank the city staff, former councilmember Garcia and council members Hodge Washington, councilman pastor and councilman Cuajardo from July 22 when we were first involved, through December of 2023, over 400 residents received services that included housing navigation, case management, rental utility assistance and resource referrals. The final results are Las casitas, 43 households which included 124 individuals Weldon Court 65 households 198 individuals periwinkle 26 households 71 individuals. Every resident made a safe landing through December of this year. We will continue to provide monthly outreach and case management. Phoenix Community Development and Investment Corporation as indicated earlier, PCDIC is a nonprofit community development entity was created by the City of Phoenix in 2001 for the purpose of applying for new market tax credits awarded by the Community Development Financial institution under the US Treasury Department. PCDIC is governed by a seven member board of directors comprised of representatives from nonprofit organizations that serve low income community and city of Phoenix executives. In addition, the board of directors approve a seven member advisory board made up of low income representatives. In July 2018, the Phoenix IdA entered into a professional, management and organizational service agreement with PCDIC. This agreement included the appointment of a chief executive officer who was under the direction of the board of directors and dedicated staff to provide the administration of PCDIC's business operations. Since 2019, PCDIC has received an allocation annually over four years for a total amount of $195 million in new market tax credits. Listed below or listed in the slide in front of you are some projects located within Phoenix. As you can tell from these these are well known organizations in this community and most of them focusing on healthcare matters. The next area is our priority for this coming year and given the the need for housing, we're implementing three objectives.

Our housing strategies to follow for the continuum of housing from homeless to home ownership and include support for the City of Phoenix Plan Phoenix Plan and the Phoenix Housing Department's choice neighborhood projects as indicated in the slide before you, they are increased participation in the production of affordable and workforce housing. Support the City of Phoenix implementation of the Housing Phoenix plan provide support for vulnerable communities and organizations served by the Phoenix IdA affordable rental housing we have seen a significant growth in 4% low income housing tax credits development in the City of Phoenix in the last few years and we'll work to continue that success. We have good relations with low income housing tax credit developers and work hard to connect them with resources and financing to facilitate affordable housing development. We will also continue to focus on conversion of 9% projects that are not awarded to 4% to ensure that the shovel ready affordable housing projects in Phoenix get built. Affordable housing development on excess and access school District land is a win win situation for school district and community. Last year, in partnership with the City of Phoenix Isaac School District in Yumon, we facilitated the first sale of excess school District property for the development of a 96 unit affordable housing. We have similar projects currently in process with Alhambra and the Osborne School District and we are in discussion with other Phoenix school districts for potential projects. Thank you mayor and council members for supporting this creative finance solution to increase housing. Partnering on development proposals we are partnering with developers to support and finance their proposals in the response to the city's rfps for development of affordable housing and city owned land. Many of these require combined combinations of affordable workforce and market rate housing. Our support can include advice, strategic planning, feasibility analysis and land banking in additional to financing, we are currently working on three proposals, the 1414 East Jefferson, central and Columbus, and the Sunnyslow Blots. We're also currently working with small local developers to finance a construction of rental housing for low income households utilizing section eight voucher. Home ownership the Home and five advantage program the Phoenix ID developed partnership with the Maricopa County IDA to offer a home in five home ownership program. Home and five helps low to moderate income households buy a home in Maricopa county. The programs provide assistance with down payment for down payments and closing costs and a loan with a competitive interest rate. The program has supported more than 25,000 new homeowners in Maricopa county, providing $195 million in down payment assistance and $5.1 billion of total loans. Mortgage loans the home in five platinum program was created in 2023 and utilizes mortgage revenue bonds to provide mortgage loans at below market interest rates about 1%. This program targets Maricopa county households at or below 100% of area median income with allowances for homebuyers in low income census tracts. A total of $200 million in tax exempt bonds was approved by the Phoenix City Council last year. The first 330 million in bonds issued for this program have already been utilized. We just issued the second tranche for $30 million this month and plan to use the remainder over the several over the in several tranches in 2024. The current interest rate in the program is 5.9% with 4% down payment assistance. Phoenix IDa is also working with community banks and nonprofit community lenders and small builders to expand financing options to build single family duplex townhomes to provide more homeownership opportunities for lower moderate income households. Support for choice neighborhoods the Phoenix idea has supported the city's Edison East Lake Choice neighborhood project from the beginning with grant matching funds, land acquisition and bond financing for housing development. We are excited to participate in the new choice neighborhoods projects that will include the Marcos Denisa community. We look forward to participating in and fund of some of the planning exercises and community meetings that will lead to the neighborhood transformation plan. We will also work closely with the city to identify and possibly purchase land in that community that will facilitate future development plans and community goals.

Future plans include apartment units on the same site for seniors who are stabilized and ready to move to permanent housing. This project is in district eight and I understand Councilwoman Hodge Washington has been briefed and is supporting the project. Last the Phoenix idea is supporting the city and the us vets by funding an on site construction manager to oversee the completion of the renovation work performed in the last two years at the hotel for homeless veterans on I 17 and cactus. Additionally, we funded the plumbing and roofing assessments needed to determine the comprehensive scope of additional work required for occupancy. We will continue to work closely with Director Matthew to provide any additional assistance needed to complete the renovation and occupy the site. This facility is located in D one. Councilwoman O'Brien, thank you for your continued support. Mayor and council members, this concludes our presentation. Thank you for the opportunity to join you this afternoon. Thank you so much, Juan, for the important presentation. And thank you in particular for the work on housing as we moved away from doing projects in places like Puerto Rico. And thank you for the focus on Phoenix. We talked about the ability to do some new priorities closer to home. So we had a council meeting in actually November 2021 where several council members, particularly councilman pastor, had some suggestions. I had talked about the IDA pursuing sustainable financing opportunities. Have you had a chance to talk to the board about strategic priorities and can you talk about how you considered those requests? Mayor Councilmember sustainability has been a major emphasis on all the projects that we're involved with. You just appointed Colin Trego, I think, who's a sustainability expert, so we're going to work with him on looking at possibilities of establishing a green bank. Secondly, the other item that came up with, we are looking at the possibility of exploring supporting venture capital groups for initiatives that are focusing on policies around healthcare. Thank you. And so I guess, first question, what would you need from us to do something like a green bank or what Tucson Ida is doing with their low impact development lens? Mayor and members of the council, at this point we're in the preliminary stages, so I don't have an ask yet, but I will be back soon to make that request. Wonderful. And we'd consider lending at preferential rates for sustainability related projects. Yes. Fabulous. Thank you so much. There's a lot of innovation coming in Arizona with different partnered entities and including from our own organization. You also manage new market tax credits. We have talked about with the IDA really focusing on Phoenix. What is our lens for whether or not the new market tax credit should go to Phoenix or to other jurisdictions? Mayor and council is a member. When the PCDIC was created in 2001, footprint was Maricopa county, and since then we've operated within that arena. So we currently have about $32 million left from the current allocation and that those funds will be targeted to Phoenix projects. Fabulous. Thank you. Councilwoman O'Brien brought up the problems we've had with the budget from the state of Arizona and how we are facing tens of millions of dollars in cuts. How can the IDA and our new market tax credits help with some of the challenges that we are facing with the Phoenix budget we have promised our voters? We are looking everywhere for resources. Mayor and council members, we're open to suggestions on how we could facilitate some of those conversations. One of my colleagues has some suggestions coming within the last year, the Phoenix IDA had discussed seeking authority from the legislature to administer projects statewide. In what scenarios would you seek projects outside the city of Phoenix and how do you differentiate between your geographical focus here and elsewhere? Mayor and members of the council, the initiative that you're describing was approved by our board to consider moving forward in three legislative agendas pending the approval of you and the council. The one you're relating to is the affordable housing. Currently, the way the legislation is set up, the state IDa can come into any area in Arizona and issue housing bonds. The counties can come into any cities and issue housing bonds. The cities are prohibited from issuing anything outside its jurisdiction. So the projects that you see here today are only but a few because I know that the state as well as the county have been issuing 4% tax credits for housing projects here. The option that we were considering was either level it to plain ground where we can all issue wherever we need to, or secondly, prohibit issuers not to issue bonds within local jurisdictions, within the cities. And councilman pastor said it first. But I think my preference is we focus on Phoenix. We had a lot of housing challenges still to solve in Phoenix.

We'll go next to Councilwoman Guardado. Thank you, mayor. The Phoenix Ida has been steadfast in their commitment to proving access to funding to benefit underserved communities, the city of Phoenix, and we are grateful for all of the hard work that you guys have done. I would, one of the things that I would like to see the idea working on, I will definitely support the need of more housing in the city of Phoenix. But one of the other challenges that our families continue to face, I'm sure everyone saw the article the other day about how the airport will now provide a childcare facility for workers at the airport. And as a console of a lot of moms, I think everyone here can understand the need for childcare facilities or being able to figure out how is it that we give access to our community, to childcare. As a mom of two young boys, just three years ago, I was paying $1,200 a month for childcare. So I cannot even imagine what the cost is today. And I know that families are choosing between paying their rent or paying their bills. And now, you know, it's a huge concern, the safety for their children. So I want to be able to see how is it that we can work with you, with you, Juan, to figure out how is it that we can partner with some folks to build some facilities for our communities. I know that there's a lot of folks out there that are starting to build affordable housing, and they're adding childcare to the affordable housing units. So I want to see if there's a way where we can think outside, continue to think outside of the box, and being able to figure out are we able to build some of affordable housing together with some childcare services as well for our community wanting to see if that's a possibility. Mayor Councilman Cujar, though we are happy to continue conversations regarding those structures. Great. Thank you. I know that it's a, I understand there is a huge financial strain on our community. There is a financial strain on the city. I think as a city, we've been able to do a lot and we've been very innovative in terms of how we've been able to help our community in times and needs. But I think with everything that's happening to our budget, I'm just going to echo what the mayor just said, that we're just going to try to rely a lot on you guys and seeing how is it that you guys can continue to be helpful to our community given our budget strengths that we're going to be going through in the next couple of years. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. That is a great idea. I think urban League has worked with us on two projects to put childcare in the facility, but there are so many parents who are just feeling stretched, and now we hear that particularly early childhood can be more expensive than college in Phoenix, Arizona. Exactly. So good thinking, I think. Councilwoman, pastor and then council Wynn Hodge, Washington one, I would like to thank all of Ida for the things that they have done. I know it's been difficult and challenging, depending on what roller coaster ride we're on and what we're trying to solve. When Ida comes in front of us. So I appreciate that. Housing is very much important to all of us. Obviously, it's important to the state and to the country. And so if we could look at or there are other people that are willing to come up and build affordable housing, obviously, the Isaac one, you, mom came forward, I believe there's another project with Alhambra Elementary School, possibly on 43rd Avenue in Thomas. I'm willing to help in getting out into community and working with developers and figuring out how we partner and how the IDA partners in order to build more affordable housing. I think sometimes we direct a lot of things that we want to see, but we're absent in really then sitting down and mapping out how we want to see it go or ways or giving you the tools in the sense of building those partnerships or relationships in order to make it happen. And so I'm willing to do that. And thank you for that. You also have, I see Cindy Stotler in here. So Cindy is, if anything, understands housing and specifically affordable housing. So I think that was a great compliment to Ida. So anything you need, I'm willing to work with. Yes, I did say I wanted projects to maintain in Phoenix, but I'm willing to budge and I'm willing to open up and say if we think that there's some projects outside of Phoenix, then bring it to us and let's see if it's doable. As you know, I came onto council and was like, why are we doing these things? You know, Phoenix needs us. So if we're making it happen, I'm willing to see and do projects outside of Phoenix. So that's what I want to say because I have said many things. There's a lot of things. But as the time and moment that we speak is a time and moment of what things are happening at that moment, and things change and moves fast and furious. And now we're onto a different issue, a different problem.

Much appreciated for everything you've done. Councilwoman Hud Washington. Thank you. Thank you, mayor. Thank you also hoang for coming out today and making a presentation to us. I join my colleagues in saying thank you for all of the great work that the Phoenix Ida is doing. I recognize that you place play a vital role in fostering economic growth, development and community advancement in our area. So for that I say thank you. Through your innovative finance and solutions, you have helped numerous business organizations and district eight has been the beneficiary of many of those efforts, from the private activity bonds to finance in harmony at the park two, and support for the choice neighborhoods such as Marcos Deniza here in D eight. You've also played a key role in helping the families in the three mobile home parks facing display placement. In fact, as you recall, one of my first meeting with you as council member elect was with the residents of La Casita. So homelessness and housing is one of my integral focuses. So it's definitely you're speaking to my passion. Respect this. I would like to see some reports on the home in five program, including the demographics that are served. And I also wanted to ensure that we consider financial support for mobile home communities that are that want to form co ops, especially given the new funding available from the Biden administration for manufactured homes and mobile homes. That might be one play we can help offset some of the displacement we've seen. Also, I'm very excited. Like you mentioned, I was brief on Senior Bridge. It's an innovative way to address one of our growing populations of unsheltered individuals or seniors, and I'm very much support of it. I love the fact that you're investing in sustainable development, taking a different approach to it, and I am for supporting the projects that promote environmental stewardship, social equity and community engagement. I think the IDA does a great job on integrating the community feedback and not just focusing on it from a business perspective, but also the personal perspective. I watched as yourself and Cindy met with those individuals in the mobile home park and we made sure that they were being handled in a manner that was befitting despite of their situation. So I just wanted to say thank you for that. And I just, I would like you to focus as much as possible on the Phoenix area, unless there's something that is, that would have a circumstantial benefit to Phoenix. But I think we have a need, growing need in our community that should be probably our focus. And I would like to see if there's anything that we could do to help advance the home in five program. For me, as an individual council member, I'm definitely interested in it because I believe that home ownership is one of the first steps toward building generational wealth for a number of families, and it's the only way. So I definitely am more of a fan of creating more opportunities for home ownership, especially for those individuals that have that probably have no way out otherwise. But other than that, I am grateful to hear the report. I'm excited to hear that $30 million of bonds have already been utilized towards that program. And we still have some more to come out. So I would just say continue the good work. Thank you. Did you want him to speak to advertising home in five or just, you guys will talk offline about ideas? All right, if you're ready, you can answer me or we can speak offline. We can take it offline because I'll bring you the information that you requested, and then we can discuss strategically how we're proceeding with that. I appreciate that. Thank you so much. Thank you, Councilwoman Ansari. Thank you, mayor. I just want to say thank you to the Ida and Juan Salgado. You have been a tremendous partner in our fight to make housing more affordable, and I very much appreciate how proactive you've always been to reach out to us as council members when you hear something in a council meeting or recognize that there's an issue. And I really, really appreciate it. So thank you for all of that you've done and will continue to do for our city. Thank you. We have four members of the public to comment on the IDA and new market tax credits. We'll begin with Mohammed, followed by Mark Rodriguez. Mayor, if I may, I want to clarify something I mentioned earlier so that I'm clear about what we can do. When I mentioned that we have $32 million of tax credits left in our current allocation, I mentioned those are focusing to Phoenix right now. As I mentioned earlier, the footprint is Maricopa county. We are. We have this item for consolidation by its board of directors at this coming agenda on Thursday. So the item will be presented.

us as council members when you hear something in a council meeting or recognize that there's an issue. And I really, really appreciate it. So thank you for all of that you've done and will continue to do for our city. Thank you. We have four members of the public to comment on the IDA and new market tax credits. We'll begin with Mohammed, followed by Mark Rodriguez. Mayor, if I may, I want to clarify something I mentioned earlier so that I'm clear about what we can do. When I mentioned that we have $32 million of tax credits left in our current allocation, I mentioned those are focusing to Phoenix right now. As I mentioned earlier, the footprint is Maricopa county. We are. We have this item for consolidation by its board of directors at this coming agenda on Thursday. So the item will be presented. Ultimately, it's the board's decision on restricting the money for the Phoenix area. Maybe we could do a sense of the council, but leave the board, many of whom are here. Thank you for your patience. Hello, everyone. Hello, Miss Mayor, Miss Ansari and council members, thank you for giving me time to speak here. I'm glad to be here. Thank you for lutheran social services provided this opportunity to be here to be part of this meeting. I know we are speaking about housing and the IDA, which councilwoman Ansari has been championed for. Let me take a couple of minutes and say a few words. Introduce myself briefly. I, Mohammed Zaire Bakshi, migrated to USA through special immigration visa in 2015 with my wife and ten months old baby from Afghanistan. I received my degree, Bachelor in Business administration and master in Business administration from India in 2010 and 2012. Right after graduation, worked as public administration advisor and public outreach specialist in municipality government in Afghanistan. So in USA, Phoenix, after six months, I started my first job as medical billing specialist in 2016 with CV's health. Then I established my import and distribution company in 2018 and started my grocery store in 2021. 1st afghan grocery store in Arizona where the needs of all afghan community can be found here. Afghan community is happy to have their back home grocery store. When they visit our store, they feel. Feel their back home taste, flavor and culture. And I ask from you all to visit. Maestro, please. So the reason I'm here to express my gratitude to Councilwoman Miss Ansari and her team for her dedication, contribution and services for the communities in Phoenix, specifically refugee communities and afghan community, by conducting Nauru celebrations every year in Phoenix, Arizona and many more. Miss Ansar, your hard work and dedication. Appreciate it. Thank you for your close relationship and communication with afghan community where we have same cultural language which helps to strengthen relations between communities. Miss Ansari, wish you more success in professional and personal life now and ahead. Thank you very much again for giving me time. Thank you. Thank you. And this wonderful testimony and discussion of councilmember on this item. If everyone who is speaking could connect it to the industrial development authority or new market tax credits, that would be fabulous. And if you want to discuss Councilman Ansari's record, we will have public comment after our next council meeting, I believe on April 3. Thank you, Mark. And then Mark is followed by Aaron.

I just wanted to give a quick shout out to our community and economic development director, Chris Mackey. On April 30, the Arizona association for Economic Development presented its annual economic development distinguished by Excellence Awards, and Chris Mackey was honored with this award for all of the outstanding work she has done over the last 25 years of service to Arizona communities, particularly to the city of Phoenix for the last twelve to 13. So I wanted to give a quick congratulations to her. Thank you, mayor. Thank you, councilman. Thank you, mayor. It's been a great first and fast couple of weeks in office, and I would like to share with you what's been going on in the community. I had the honor of attending the 11th annual Police Officer Memorial honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice while in the line of duty, among them Gilbert Chavez, a fellow Hayden Winkleman native, and a reminder of the seriousness of the work that law enforcement does on a daily basis. Next last week I got a chance to attend the 38th annual outstanding youth leader of the year award ceremony where Charles Mada of Betty Fairfax and Taylor Price of Bioscience High School, two members of District seven were recognized. I want to extend my appreciation to state Representative Cesar Aguilar for inviting me to the cruise to the Capitol event highlighting the culture of cruising in the valley and its impact on our community. Next yesterday I joined Mayor Gallego and Doctor Hondula in spreading the word about our heat relief cooling centers across the sand. If you're wondering where you can find the nearest cooling center, give two one one a call. A call. Last week I had the pleasure of attending a great deal of events, one of them being the CZA VotA Voter registration, a nonpartisan campaign for voter registration, meeting with D seven neighborhood organizations and members of the Workers United Organization, and learning about our Phoenix library. Lastly, if you're a resident of District Seven and you're wondering how to get in touch with me, it's quite simple. Please feel free to reach out via any of the following channels. I'm here to serve you and I value your input immensely, whether it's a suggestion on improving our community, a problem that needs addressing, or simply a question you need answered, don't hesitate to get in touch. Thank you. Thank you, councilman. Any additional updates? All right, thank you. We will go to item number one. I will turn it over to our city manager, Jeff Barton. Mayor, members of the council, good afternoon and thank you for giving us this opportunity today. Amber and I will do a brief presentation, and I will just simply start things off before I turn it over to our esteemed budget and research director, Amber Williamson. First and foremost, I want to thank you for your guidance and your leadership over the last year as we've developed and worked on developing the 24 25 fiscal year budget. As you know, we find ourselves in really peculiar times in terms of coming out of the pandemic. We did have great stewardship and great leadership on your part that put us in a position where we stand today, where we have an $80 million surplus. In any other time, we'd be celebrating, and we'd be fortunate to have that surplus to be able to add and augment the services that we already provide to our residents. Unfortunately, though, as you know, the state has taken several actions that will hamper our ability to continue the services that we provide our residents, those vital services that our residents have come to depend on. Specifically in fiscal year 25 26 and 26 27, we know we are facing a fiscal cliff. We also know that we are facing shortfalls because of the actions that have been taken by our state legislature. And so today, what we have for you is a budget that not only allows us to continue the services that we've come to know and love and that our residents have come come to depend on, it also gives us a fighting chance at making sure that those services", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Arizona Asian Chamber of Commerce", "insights": [{"observation": "Hosting the incredible Asian night market highlighting multiculturally owned establishments.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "493 Firefighter Foundation", "insights": [{"observation": "Proceeds from the event went to the community programs and to firefighters that are battling occupational cancer.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Coronado Neighborhood Association", "insights": [{"observation": "Hosting a community pool party to kick off the summer.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "Arizona Association for Economic Development presented its annual economic development distinguished by Excellence Awards, and Chris Mackey was honored with this award for outstanding work.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice while in the line of duty.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Spreading the word about our heat relief cooling centers across the city.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Caution around fiscal cliff and shortfalls due to actions taken by the state legislature.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Developing the 24-25 fiscal year budget to continue providing services to residents.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Arizona Asian Chamber of Commerce", "insights": [{"observation": "Hosting the incredible Asian night market highlighting multiculturally owned establishments.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "493 Firefighter Foundation", "insights": [{"observation": "Proceeds from the event went to the community programs and to firefighters that are battling occupational cancer.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Coronado Neighborhood Association", "insights": [{"observation": "Hosting a community pool party to kick off the summer.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "Arizona Association for Economic Development presented its annual economic development distinguished by Excellence Awards, and Chris Mackey was honored with this award for outstanding work.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice while in the line of duty.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Spreading the word about our heat relief cooling centers across the city.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Caution around fiscal cliff and shortfalls due to actions taken by the state legislature.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Developing the 24-25 fiscal year budget to continue providing services to residents.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 312194, "chunk_end_time": 696438, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagLEBwPtvU", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagLEBwPtvU&t=312s"}, {"start": 9000, "end": 15000, "text": " the pandemic.

And so I think, I would just like to use a famous quote that I believe another famous philadelphian said back in 1736, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. And so that's what today's budget is about. It's about protecting and preventing what we think could happen because of the roadmap that we've shown you in the past couple of weeks. And with that, I'll turn it over to Amber Williamson. Thank you, Jeff Mayor, members of the council, and Phoenix residents. So I'm pleased to be here today to present to you the 24 25 proposed budget. I'm going to cover a recap of our general fund budget status that was presented on February 27 and again with the trial budget in March. I'll then go over the proposed budget for the general fund for next fiscal year. I'll talk about the steps that we took to make sure residents could provide input on the budget, and then I'll go over next steps for legal budget adoption. So, to recap our general fund status for next fiscal year, our estimated resources 2,099,000,000 less our estimated cost to deliver programs and services 2,019,000,000. We are arriving at a total surplus next year of $80 million. That does represent a one time resource. Unfortunately, as referenced by our city manager, due to the state's actions to eliminate residential rental and to lower the individual income tax to the current flat tax, we are projecting deficits. This was presented to council on February 27 starting in fiscal 25 26, again in 26 27 baseline deficit 92 million in fiscal 26 and another deficit of 31 million estimated in fiscal 27. To demonstrate what the budget outlook would have looked like if the state didn't take action to reduce our revenue, we would have been looking at an estimated surplus next year year of roughly 134 million, a manageable deficit of 6 million in fiscal 26 and a $55 million estimated surplus in 26 27. It's for these reasons that the city manager is estimating or recommending that we set aside that $80 million in reserve. That one time surplus then could be used to preserve critical general fund programs and services for the community, as well as to be available to help balance the 25 26 budget. I also want to mention the council. As you know, you are required to adopt a balanced budget every year. We're fiscally responsible. We want to make sure that we have a sustainable budget. We also want to make sure that we have resources in the future to provide for the general obligation bond projects that the voters approved last November to open new fire stations and parks and libraries and community centers. We know it's a priority of the council to make sure we do offer residents many opportunities to provide their feedback on the budget. We did that through eleven community budget hearings held from April 2 through the 16th across the city of Phoenix, as well as residents contacted budget and research directly. They used the fund Phoenix tool as well. Overall, we saw support for the proposed budget. We know residents want us to preserve existing services, but we did hear from residents who want more service. They definitely don't want less service. We heard some major themes, including more funding for eviction, legal assistance, funding for water drinking fountains, services for the library, more resources for the fire department, funding for affordable housing to address homelessness, as well as improvements for street and bike infrastructure in total, 359 comments from 172 residents. Some residents did provide more than one comment on the same item. Included in your council report today and available online for residents is more information about how city departments are using existing resources to address some of these areas. We know also as we look forward, if we have additional general fund resources in the future, we could bring back to council opportunities to maybe provide additional resources to these areas. We are asking council for next fiscal year's budget to approve converting existing budgeted resources to add 30 critical positions in a number of different departments. Again, no additional funds are needed. This has already been accounted for in the proposed budget that's presented to you today. This really primarily represents converting existing temporary positions to ongoing status for departments such as communications, neighborhood services, city council, finance, public works, police and planning and development. And more detail on those positions is included in your council report. Next steps for our legal budget adoption process we'll come back on May 21 for action. That's the budget decisions. We need you to make those decisions so we can move on to our legal budget adoption process. May 29 would be tentative adoption, June 12 would be final budget adoption, and then July 1 is property tax levy adoption. And with that, we can answer any questions that you have.

Thank you, councilmember. Questions Councilman passed over. I have a question in this budget, I understand we're gonna hold the 80 million where I believe that some of the savings came from. I don't know what your formula is, but whatever your formula is, and also from savings from vacancies, I have a concern, or I wanna know that the crisis response team is going to be filled because there are several positions in there and that they will continue to be filled as we go through this process. Thank you for the question, councilwoman, pastor, mayor, members of the council. That's correct. They're free to fill those vacant positions. We do every year budget amount for vacant positions, we simply have attrition. So we want to account for that savings in the budget, but no department, including that program, is prevented from filling any of their vacant positions. Okay. I just want to be, I just want it on the record, absolutely. To make sure that those positions are critical and they're critical to the community and it helps us also with our office of homeless Solutions and another impacts that happen within the community. I just know that they had a number of vacancies and I was worried about that. So thank you for verifying. You're welcome. Thank you. And thank you to government affairs, which continues to work, to talk to the state of Arizona about the very negative impacts of these steep and rapid cuts in revenue. Any additional comments before we go to public comment? All right, we will begin with Eric Nelson, followed by Patrick Daniel. Hello, my name is Eric. Quick housekeeping note. Before I get to the. Get to the budget, I want to apologize to the last officer that arrested me. He had no way of knowing I was going to cut tuberculosis at LBJ. So I'm sorry. I was just feeling some type of way about having to go to central booking within an hour of being in central booking. Anyway, with that said about the budget, I'm sorry to hear that state of Arizona is robbing you guys. I know you guys worked really hard for that, buddy. So I just saw. That's really unfortunate news. I didn't know that. What I came to speak about is how leadership translates to financial success. Specifically, people like. People like Bill Gates and Elon Musk aren't going to keep giving you guys money without strong leadership because they didn't know their investment safe. It's just the way greedy people are. And the other thing I want to say about strong leadership is that I heard through the grape find that I'm not sure this is true or not. Like I said, maybe this is a rumor, but I heard through the grape find that Mary Kekallego is not ready for reelection. And it makes sense, seeing as how there's no way for her to go up. I know the Democratic Party could probably use her in a more competitive race, but if I were her, I would just run for gravis seat because it'd be the easiest one to get. And then finally, I just want to point out that true leadership is hard to come by. But there's some people in this room who exemplify an even higher level of leadership that I like to refer to as presidential leadership. People like Jeff Barton, the mayor, and Keisha Hodgewashington, they do it for a presidential job of leadership. And the difference is, true leadership is the captain going down with the ship. That's expected. A presidential version of leadership is the crew going down with the captain. That's called Greg Carnagal. Thank you for your time. Thank you. And just a reminder, if folks could keep their testimony on the subject of the budget. Next we have Patrick, followed by Luke. Good afternoon, mayor, members of council. My name is Patrick, director. I'm speaking today in my capacity as director of advocacy for Phoenix committee Alliance. On behalf of our board of directors, as well as our nearly 350 members, we understand that the city of Phoenix finds itself in a unprecedented position, not of its own making with this year's budget. The budget as it stands right now, provides the best chance forward, the best options forward, to deliver services, maintain services for a city that's growing rapidly. On behalf of our advocacy committees, we ask that no reductions be made to funding for office of homeless Solutions. This is an office that in a very short time has demonstrated its worth and demonstrated its capacity to help people out of homelessness. We also ask that no reductions be made to grants for. To grants and public art maintenance. The humanities are what truly make us truly make this city a livable place for everybody that lives, works and plays here. So, please, no. Accustomed to those programs, we also ask that funding be maintained for any program that promotes active transportation, multimodal transportation, and in a downtown that's growing rapidly, once again, the option to have other means of transit for people who wish to do so is becoming more and more important. Finally, we ask that no reductions be made to staff at planning and develop", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "The budget primarily represents converting existing temporary positions to ongoing status for departments such as communications, neighborhood services, city council, finance, public works, police, and planning and development.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Ensuring that the crisis response team positions are filled and maintained as they are critical to the community and support the office of homeless solutions.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Government affairs continue to work with the state of Arizona to address the negative impacts from steep and rapid cuts in revenue.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Request to maintain funding for the office of homeless Solutions as it has demonstrated its capacity to help people out of homelessness.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Request to maintain grants and public art maintenance as the humanities contribute to making the city livable.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Request to maintain funding for programs that promote active transportation and multimodal transportation.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "The budget primarily represents converting existing temporary positions to ongoing status for departments such as communications, neighborhood services, city council, finance, public works, police, and planning and development.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Ensuring that the crisis response team positions are filled and maintained as they are critical to the community and support the office of homeless solutions.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Government affairs continue to work with the state of Arizona to address the negative impacts from steep and rapid cuts in revenue.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Request to maintain funding for the office of homeless Solutions as it has demonstrated its capacity to help people out of homelessness.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Request to maintain grants and public art maintenance as the humanities contribute to making the city livable.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Request to maintain funding for programs that promote active transportation and multimodal transportation.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 930652, "chunk_end_time": 1334118, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagLEBwPtvU", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagLEBwPtvU&t=930s"}, {"start": 19000, "end": 25000, "text": "des the best chance forward, the best options forward, to deliver services, maintain services for a city that's growing rapidly.

We have very few historic assets left in some parts of the city, and we must do all we can to maintain. And finally, should additional resources be available, we do ask that increases in staffing at the housing department, which are dedicated to providing affordable housing stock, be considered. So, once again, thank you for the work that's been put into this budget, and thanks for the opportunity to speak today. Thank you. Thank you. Next we have Luke, followed by Carrie. Good afternoon, members of council. My name is Luke. I am a member of District seven. I am here today in opposition to this budget. You know, to be frank, it's a disappointment. You know, we've listened for the last two months as the city manager has told us that we don't have any money. We don't have any money. A deficit is coming. A deficit is coming. We have to set aside $80 million. We have to keep this money so that we can be safe as a city. And yet we turn around and we found 27 million more dollars in this budget to give to the police that no one was asking for. And that money is ultimately money that comes from us. Right? It comes from the members of this community that need that money to be healthy, to be safe, but it's not going to us. It's not going to keep us safe. It's not going to keep us healthy. It's not going to protect us. It's going to the police. I sat in community hearings with members of this council and watched as folks talked about needing emergency relief for heat, talked about needing support for eviction. The firefighters even were there talking about how horrible their response time is. And yet this budget took money away from them. Like this budget is disappointing. I would like to actually speak to one specific thing. Maybe it's an opportunity that you all have to do something good. In this budget, there are five heat station, five water stations identified as being expanded and expanded hours at a few locations. Five water stations in the fifth largest city in the country in record heat. I mean, that's a joke, y'all. Like, we can only find money for five water stations and we can only expand our hours in places in four select locations. None of that heat relief is on the west side. That's your district council member, Galindo Alvira. That's your district, Laura pastor. That's your district council member, Guardado. Please invest in the people of this city and stop giving our money to the police. Carrie is next. Guadalupe Proxima. Hello, my name is Carrie and I live in district four. Oh, good afternoon, council people. I've never been in one of these before, but I am a permanently disabled single mom who has faced homelessness four times. And what did not help me was more millions going to police to act against our needs. What would have helped me, since I'm also reliant on public transportation, is water. Also, it would have been nice to know what my rights were if I was facing eviction or when. I'm a tenant for a landlord that does not provide for me. I don't have access to legal representation. Our needs are not being taken care of. I think that there would be a whole lot less crime, or actually it's kind of a fact that there's going to be less crime and we're going to be safer if our needs are met. And we don't need a military to act against us. We need more water stations, we need access to housing, we need access to know how to defend ourselves and how to provide for ourselves. We can't provide for our needs and with the state of our current city. Thank you. I am in opposition, to wit, the way you're spending our taxes, our money. I don't have a lot of money, but I would like it to be used to help us. Thank you, Guadalupe. And then viri. Buenas tardes, minambre.

The city found these funds, these special funds, additional ones for more housing and for more, or they should be finding these funds for more housing, for more water and heat relief for these fountains. These water fountains. The heat is going to be tremendous. The city has no destiny or hasn't destined this money for legal help either the help that these people need that are facing eviction once again. And we're finding out that the city is giving priority to the police regarding security and safety to our communities. But yet we have four demands. Stop giving money to the police and give it to our communities. Invest 27 million of this that was found to support our communities. Five water fountains, new ones. And also we feel that there isn't sufficient water fountains in our parks. So every building in the city should have a water fountain, an adequate one. And finance permanently these programs for the legal services for the people that are being evicted and creating this fund for these people that are facing eviction or are facing violations of their rights as tenants. Thank you. Thank you. Vidi is next. Blanca proxima. Okay, just for an interpretation, people are going to share just a little bit later and then translate and then break and then translate. So I gave them that instruction. So, y'all okay? Hi, everyone. My name is Beatty. It is really frustrating to hear again that there is no money and that we need to get ready. I remember year after year coming where there was empty police positions that had been vacant for over five years, and we kept funding them. We kept giving that money. We didn't move those two necessary resources, and there was always money. Now there's $27 million added to the police general fund. To the police. From the general fund. General fund. This is our money, right? This is where our funds are going. This is what we get to fight for. And at times, it feels like we're fighting for crumbs. But yet here we found $27 million from general funds, again, to go to the police department. That is almost a billion dollar police department that hasn't had an impact into what people are saying is safety. When are we going to start funding solutions? When are we going to start addressing the root causes of issues? When are we going to support people? Right now, one of the biggest, you know, you have a pilot program for the eviction. That program needs to grow. That program needs to be invested in. There are a lot of members of our members, but also across your districts that are coming to us to seek legal support because they are being. Their rights are being violated. We need to see an investment in this because we're going to have is more people that are unsheltered, and then what are we going to respond to that? It's with more police. That is always your response. It's more police. We don't need more police. We need to solve the issues. We need to solve the problems. We need to actually get to the root causes. And so this budget, right, is a disappointment because it, again, is moving our money, our taxpayer dollars, back into things that people are not asking for, back to policing. We also need you all to fight for these water stations, these heat reliefs, to have more. In West Phoenix, you have displaced people from downtown, you're moving people out, and they're going into our communities. And we need to see investment in these resources in West Phoenix. Thank you, Blanca E. And Helena. Good afternoon. My name is Blanca. Soy del distritos Siete. And I pertain to district seven. I've been living over 20 years in that area. And I'm going to take into consideration, serious consideration, the recommendation from our representative, what he just said, as far as going out and seeking him out so that he can support us in the south area, I've always thought about it. I've always mentioned it. I've manifested it in our community. When we have awareness, intention, intention and action, we can accomplish many things within the same needs of the needs that our community, what our community has. Sobredinero que de beria employer se verdadera mente en la communidat. In all honesty, it's very frustrating that we're hearing regarding this budget, about the monies that should be employed. They should. Honestly, they should be employed within the community. Ocenta Milones.

I've been living over 20 years in that area. And I'm going to take into consideration, serious consideration, the recommendation from our representative, what he just said, as far as going out and seeking him out so that he can support us in the south area, I've always thought about it. I've always mentioned it. I've manifested it in our community. When we have awareness, intention, intention and action, we can accomplish many things within the same needs of the needs that our community, what our community has. Sobredinero que de beria employer se verdadera mente en la communidat. In all honesty, it's very frustrating that we're hearing regarding this budget, about the monies that should be employed. They should. Honestly, they should be employed within the community. Ocenta Milones. Sagarigaro. Venticiete Milones mas a la policia. It's incredible. I'm hearing here that there's $80 million, and of that, 27 million was added for the police. Do you know what I would do with 27 million in the community? I would help my community to flourish, and you guys also would be benefiting it from it as well. Violencia general. Violence creates more violence. We need more youth for them, healthy youth, for them to live a good life. Sicremos mas violencia estaremos atra gendo and nostrosohovenes a las drogas a las protestion. Ilaverda por esperiencia. Propria de la esperiencia. La policia no esta yudando. Ennada a solutamente. If we're creating more violence, then we're attracting our kids to drugs and prostitution. And honestly, by my own experience, this experience with the police is not really helping at all. Existe una crisis de vivienda. Claro ques. Por que nostra familia l'osestan viviendo. Does. Is there a living crisis or living crisis? Yes, of course, because our families, they are seeing it. Necessitamo mas parque saludables conagua. We need more parks, healthy ones with water, five water stations. Well, tell me where that address would be at so I can go and walk, so I can drink water there for all the parks in our city. Lastly, next year, if you do need somebody in accounting, I offer myself to help out so that we can help the community and so that the community would benefit for it. Is that okay? Thank you for your attention, Angelina. Followed by low. Okay. Buena Stardes, Minambre, Sangelina. Represent. Hello, my name is Angelina and I'm here, I live in district seven and I'm here representing the community. And I want for all of you to look at me. I know you're all looking down, looking at your computers, but I want you to look at me. I want you to know, I want to know if you guys feel proud of the position that you guys are holding because I don't think that the community is proud of you because we know that your decisions that you took regarding the budget and the decisions that you are taking, we know that there's going to be more deaths because of the heat. Tambien sabemos que ba vermas familias de Salojadas, ninos Madres, muchas familias. And we also know that theres going to be more and more families that are homeless, kids, mothers, many families that are going to be evicted because they werent taken into consideration. We also know that there's going to be more suicides, more problems in households because they weren't taking into consideration because of their mental health. But what we do know is that there are going to be more cops, as if that's really going to save our lives. All I want you to know, and I want to know that each time somebody dies because they get dehydrated because there wasn't these five fountains, water fountains, then it really be slap in the face, honestly, it would be a slap in the face of the. I also want you to know that each family that would be sleeping out in the streets because they didn't have the money to pay their rent, because they didn't receive any help or any legal help so that they can be protected, it's going to be your responsibility because of your new decisions. I don't know if you feel good with your decision that you took, but as a citizen from this country, I feel very disillusioned. You would assume that in this country there is no injustice, but we're seeing it. It's unfair. It's unfair that the police get 27 million and we don't have water and people are dying out there in the streets. Thank you for your attention. Low is next. I, Estella hello. My name is Los Vitak. I live in Tempe, but I am frequently in Phoenix. And I also feel that I should have a say because the city of Phoenix is really a model for the entirety of Arizona, I completely agree with what people have been saying previously, that we need to invest in the community. This looks like homelessness solutions, public transport, protecting arts and history, affordable housing. And more specifically, we need to fund heat relief and eviction support. Because as we all know, at least within this community, the police, police are not helping anybody. The sheer amount of money, 27 million added to the billion that they already have, doesn't make any sense when what we really need are these community solutions. It's been shown all over the country that police are really just causing more violence. It's a never ending cycle. So if we know that this isn't a proper solution, I don't understand why this money isn't going to solutions that we know actually work. For example, water. This should be a basic human right. The access to police is not a basis human right, but access to housing, access to water, access to just basic protections, these should be obvious, these should be for everyone.

Distrito Cinco. Hello. Good afternoon. My name is Estela and I live in district five. All I want to say is that I don't know how many years need to go by before you begin or before you stop ignoring us. No tambien, no cada anio souven. Las cosas. Las cosas que compramo las cosas que que usamos y cadanos y pagamos in puestos in nunca tinen dineros. And also, we're not here to request anything from you. We're here to demand because it's our money. Each year things go up and up. Things, the things that we buy, things that we use every year. Everything's just going up every year. And we pay. We pay our taxes. And you guys never have the money as well. Perolosotro. La semos ano. Trasanio. Trasanio. Vamos. Puerto puerta algo quetam betty guardado de ld casa piando firmas paraponer en los las partes fence. Puerta puerta. Paragus. De las Personas, not enemas. Propio voluntario los circos. Okay, moving. Gracias. And so we're working. We're working so that you can know as far as the needs that our community has. And we're working. We're always talking to the community about things that you guys are not doing. We're talking to the community. You only talk to the community when you need the vote. But us, we do it year after year, and we go from door to door. Something that also, you're not doing because you're sending your workers. Like, for example, well, let's say councilwoman Guardado in district five, her people, they were close to my house asking for signatures and putting them up behind the. Putting them in parts behind the. She didn't work. And mayor, the interpreter doesn't want to watch this part here, so I'm going to ask for a repetition of that part. Ustedijo que berry guardado que dijo en cuento. She pays her workers. She's out looking for signatures so that we can sign and so that we can get things in the community. But us, we do it voluntarily. We go out and we go out and seek out the different needs that there are much more in. Las cayes. Los.com lenosa keremos, keagano, servicio parallas Personas, alohadas. I mucha gentes. Yes. And we have three demands with you, and that's all. Install water, these water fountains outside the buildings, outside the parks, outside the buildings. And we also, we want accessible living because there's lots of people that are living out on the streets. These people, they're not out there just because they want to. And another thing, we also want there to be a service for people that are evicted. There's lots of people that don't have money to pay for their living and their expenses. And so that's why we need, and that's why we don't need the 97 million to the police. And please, that money, that if you can find, find it and find out how you can help out the community, because in any other case, why would you be sitting there? Thank you, Isabel. Followed by Hector. I'm here to express, like my fellow community members, my disappointment and frustration at this proposed budget. The city is proposing to increase the amount of funding to police from the general fund, which is unrestricted taxpayer dollars, by $27 million. Instead of prioritizing the needs and demands of community members, it was good to see investment in more affordable housing and five water station and also, that is not enough. Phoenix is one of the biggest cities in the country, and five additional water stations is not enough. It's a joke when we told community members they left, especially when considering that unsheltered folks have been displaced and are being pushed out into west and South Phoenix, where it doesn't seem like those fountains are even going to be located. We also don't see any permanent funding for the emergency eviction legal services program that many people asked for to legally support tenants whose rights are being violated instead of allocating $27 million more to the police. You can use that money to sufficiently fund water stations and heat relief throughout the city throughout the city, and to provide legal support to prevent evictions and keep people housed and safe from the heat. Stop giving our tax dollars to police. Invest it back into us, into our neighborhoods to address root causes and meet people's immediate needs. Hector next, followed by Ben. Good afternoon, counsel. My name is Hector Jaramillo. My family and I work in Phoenix. We shop and live in much of our lives in Phoenix, and I'm deeply troubled by the recent budget allocation.

My name is Hector Jaramillo. My family and I work in Phoenix. We shop and live in much of our lives in Phoenix, and I'm deeply troubled by the recent budget allocation. Despite a claimed deficit, the city managed to find an additional $27 million into the police, which could be better used for crucial community services. This move prioritizes policing over the safety and well being of our communities. I reject this decision and urge the council to redirect the $27 million toward initiatives benefiting our communities. Specifically, I call for expanding access to drinking fountains and extending heat relief hours until 10:00 p.m. citywide during the summer summer. Furthermore, it's urgent to expand and permanently fund the emergency Eviction Legal services program. Many residents face eviction threats amid rising housing costs and economic instability, things we are all feeling the impact of today. I also want to highlight a personal story. My partner, a preschool teacher, had her class shut down due to funds being cut from her school. This is a real, this is a real, this is a real, tangible impact of our budget decision, negatively impacting our community's children. And yet we can find 27 million more for police. Our communities deserve investments prioritizing real safety, community investment and housing security. And I hope we can allocate resources to policies that meet the genuine needs of our residents to uphold equity and justice. Thank you. Thank you. Ben is next, followed by luce. Hi, my name is Ben. I live in district seven. I'm here today in opposition to the city budget. At first glance, I had a bit of hope. Looking at this year's budget, in a lot of ways, it feels like y'all have been listening to what community members have been telling you we need for the past few years, and that really matters for our everyday quality of life. What I cannot understand, though, is this budget increase for the police department. Maybe some folks are looking at it and saying it's only 2.4 million. But, y'all, they were under budget by $40 million last year. In what world does it make sense to increase a department budget that was under budget by $40 million? In fact, for the past 15 years, they have been under budget, on average over 17 million per year. In that time, the annual police budget has grown over $275 million. And not only is the proposal to grow that budget, the plan is to increase their allocation of the general fund budget dollars by 27 million. Doubling down on criminalization and incarceration as a strategy for public safety is kind of your thing. So I honestly wasn't that surprised. But what really blew my mind about this was that the increase for police is happening at the same time the fire department budget is being decreased. I don't know what you all were doing during the community budget hearings, but what I saw was dozens of firefighters coming in and saying, we are in a crisis. It's cool that there's bond money for more fire stations. That's very important. But what I heard the fire department saying is that we are stretched too thin. How could y'all possibly justify cutting their budget? I grew up in a town with a volunteer fire department. I was in a house fire as a. Thankfully, everyone was okay. But that house and all the meaningful belongings never stood a chance. So how do I now live in a city with a $2 billion general fund that can shuffle money to find 27 million for police, but continues to set its fire department and its residents up for failure? This is another clear example of prioritizing the police budget over resources that actually make our neighborhoods healthy and safe. We need you all to address issues at the root and stop using police as a way to try and disappear the humans you see as proud problems. We're here today to ask you for more permanent support of housing units and to find a permanent funding source for legal assistance for renters. We need cool water access in all of our parks and other public spaces. Rather than using the 27 million in general funds for police, spend it on resources that are going to keep people alive. Thank you. Thank you. Luce is next. Followed the proxima bertha lose. Okay. Buenos Aires, luz viviendas, boya perdami, traila yoya perdu natrala de miha. Pero la mana. Yes. Good afternoon. My name is Luz, and I'm here to ask for help for the community. We're asking for there to be more housing. I live in a community, in a trailer park community. And so we're asking, or we're going through, currently through a crisis. There is lots of demand, we're going through many things and lots of stress. And so then I would like to express that I don't feel safe in that place. I think that at any given moment I'm going to lose my trailer. I already lost one trailer, and I'm currently in my daughter's trailer. But the manager is constantly looking for excuses to kick us out and to evict us.

My name is Luz, and I'm here to ask for help for the community. We're asking for there to be more housing. I live in a community, in a trailer park community. And so we're asking, or we're going through, currently through a crisis. There is lots of demand, we're going through many things and lots of stress. And so then I would like to express that I don't feel safe in that place. I think that at any given moment I'm going to lose my trailer. I already lost one trailer, and I'm currently in my daughter's trailer. But the manager is constantly looking for excuses to kick us out and to evict us.

And so it's very hard living there, and I just can't. I can't be successful. And we're all living with this pressure, and we're people that want to be successful, but we're living with all this pressure. I have a job, I'm a mother of four, and I have my housework that I do as a housewife. And when I get home, let's just say that I just can't sleep, I'm so stressed. And the first, on the first of this month, I was surprised. I got a very big surprise that on my app, on my telephone, I tried to pay my rent, and I was blocked out. So then I started looking, what's going on? And I just. I couldn't handle it. I ended up in a hospital. I had a brain hemorrhage. And so I was hospitalized, and that's just not alive. I do have an attorney for four months, but that attorney has not resolved anything. And during those four months, and by the way, I'm from district seven, and I know that Mister Galindo, he's new in this district, and I ask you, I ask for your support for me, for my family, for the community, and as a father, as a mother till our last breath, for our kids, and to give a better quality of life for them. All this week, I haven't been able to attend work. I feel like my eyes, they're very swollen. My. My body hurts all over. And this lady, she just doesn't let her guard down. She's very demanding. She's sending me lots of letters, and I just have to put up with that, the stress. I feel so threatened by her. And that's all I want to say. Thank you very much. Hello, my name is Berta, and I'm also here because I'm against what you're doing with the $27 million that was given to the police. I think that you're not listening in the meetings, the community meetings, where the community was there present and participating. We were talking about housing, right? Regarding our homes, where we have our families, that they're living in fear. They're in fear. They express what they're living. They're in fear of where they're living at because of police. Likewise, they're threatening that they're not going to do anything, or they're. The other thing is, because we're gonna. The fact that we call the police and see la policia Tamiya de acuerdo con los manejadores de los Duenos, I feel the police also, they're in agreement with the managers of these different homes because they just go out and they want to evict you. They want to evict the people instead of helping us. They're not protecting us. And, well, I'm here asking for security. We're only judging people that are out in the streets because they're living out in the streets. But you don't know, how is it that these people ended up out in the streets and why they ended up in the streets? I currently have friends right now that they just got evicted from their homes, and they're ending up out in the streets. They don't have enough to pay for rent. Rent is so expensive nowadays. No maspor el color de supiel opor que lllo des quiero vida. And so the police are not doing their job. I have here kids, right? And so for them, I'm gonna continue fighting, because come tomorrow, I don't want that anybody would say that they're supporting us, and we just don't feel safe with the police. I just don't want them to be end up killed someday because of the color of their skin or because they were in fear for their lives. And so I ask, and I thank you, and I ask that these $27 million that you gave the police, that's our money, and we have a right to decide. We have a right where it goes. Gloria.

They haven't been taken into account because how is it possible that you want to give that money to the police?

I'm asking that you be compassionate with the community. All those millions of dollars that you give to the police because, or maybe you're going to use it to buy all these stars, to make parties with these honorary people or the police, that they go out and they're killing our people. I think that my feeling is that for you to please listen to all of the community, those millions of dollars that you're giving to them, you can spread it out here, within all of this community here, all of this community, because they have lots of needs. That's all I want to say. Thank you. Thank you. Arnab is next, followed by Teresa online. Hello, my name is Arnab Kabir from district nine, and I am honored to be here. After circling the area for about half an hour looking for parking that I thought was free. It's not. To establish a bit of my own credibility, I would like to mention that I have worked with the homelessness over the past couple of years in the Phoenix, Tempe and Mesa area and have delivered so much food that, legally speaking, my car can be legally described as a bowl of soup. Under FDA guidelines, I oppose the budget and in particular the $27 million that is being allocated to the if the police were effective, we wouldn't see so much organized dissent in this council room. If the police were fair, we wouldn't see so much organized dissent. Primarily composed of minority populations, the minority is disproportionately composing the impoverished individuals. And after the dissolution of the area known as the zone, there needs to be more funding to providing to these minority populations and the impoverished. We need more water stations. The distance between them is simply too great. I used to condemn jaywalking until I realized that that 1 second of time saved can save you from heatstroke, though they have no excuse. Over the winter, there need to be more heat relief funding. I've seen people incapacitated from heatstroke and no one else seems to care that much about actually helping those people who are incapacitated. The police don't need more money. And to end off, I would like to note. I would like to bring up a bit about the discussion on Phoenix being remodeled. I would like to say that let Phoenix be reborn in the comforting warmth of the community, not the scorching heat of violence. Let Phoenix be reborn again. Don't clip its wings. Thank you. Theresa is next, followed by Anna. Thank you, mayor and council. Thank you for allowing me to comment for this additional funding. I'd like to see in the budget.

Let the city of Phoenix come together and shine again. Anna is next, followed by Rebecca. Good afternoon, council. My name is Anna and I am recently graduated ASU student living in Tempe. I want to speak today about the city's budget. I acknowledge that I elected to support this budget when registering for this meeting. However, I now reject this and oppose the current budget. Closer examination of the agenda document revealed that the allocation of these funds is misleading and unfair. $27 million of the general fund was added to the police despite claims of there being no money for services that actually help communities to keep them safe. As in the city is only adding five new water stations and expanding heat relief hours at limited locations. This is fully inadequate. This will not be enough to protect people from the extreme heat of the summer heat that will only get worse. That will make investments in accessible water wholly worthwhile. I ask that the city take $27 million away from the police and invest that money into more drinking fountains and expand hours of heat relief until 10:00 p.m. for all locations. And I ask that the city expand and permanently fund legal support for people facing evictions. People need investments into their wellness. We do not need more police and expanded police power. Thank you. Thank you. Rebecca is next, followed by Miros. My name is Rebecca Denis. I live in district seven. While I am grateful to see so many programs and services, the community fought for being funded or expanded, the reality is that there is simply not enough investment into these services. It's especially disappointing to see that many of these investments aren't coming from the general fund, but instead are being funded by special revenue streams like grant funds. Those funds aren't sustainable and we can't rely on special revenue to fund critical services and resources we deserve as a community. Yet you found $27 million from the general fund for a deadly police department that hasn't been accountable and doesn't have to be accountable for the harm they cause because you don't hold them accountable. Stop giving the police our money. Money our community needs to be holistically safe and healthy. Those $27 million need to be diverted back into other city departments that directly address the most urgent needs and to improve the long term health and quality of life of our community. If in fact the city keeps the 80 million in a reserve, then I am demanding that none of that money go to the police in the next fiscal year either expand and permanently fund the emergency eviction legal services program. Five new water stations is not enough. Heat relief stations need to all be open till 10:00 p.m. and we need more of them. Every park in every city must have working and accessible drinking fountains. And we need more heat relief locations. And you know, I have a disabled mother since I was three years old. Three years old is the age when I first had a call 911. I'm 34. I'll be 34 this year. I've had to call 911 many times throughout my life. Too many to count while I watch my mom be unconscious or go through really intense medical processes. I've been out in public at the movie theater when I've had a call 911. Nine minutes is what firefighters are saying is the response time. That's a long time. That's critical for my mom. Two years ago when she was in septic shock and they had to call 911. I don't know how many minutes took for them to get there, but I can tell you 911 when you're in renal failure is a long time. I'm shocked firefighters aren't getting more money. It's a slap in the face to them. It's a slap in the face to our community. This is a disgrace. Shame on you. Our final speaker will be Meros. Hello to all council members. My name is mirrors. I'm a resident in district six. I'm opposed to this budget. I'm also angry to see that our city has added an additional 27 million from the general fund to the police. Like it was expressed before, months before. You've lied to us by telling us that there weren't enough funds for demands. Demands for services to keep our communities healthy and safe. How is it that weeks later the city finds these funds and provides them to the police? Why is it that the city only added these five water stations with limited hours? The sun's out longer than the hours you proposed. The heat's going to increase. How many lives does it take for you all to understand that the access to water to basic needs is a human right and that every park should have water fountains on top of that? That the heat relief location hours, they have to be expanded past 10:00. Keep these. Keep these services in mind. And also what is happening in our city. We have higher rates and evictions. We demand that the expansion and permanent for the funds for the emergency eviction program, these are demands that should enhance and will enhance the well being of our community. And we ask you to not ignore that our lives are being lost because of the heat.

How many lives does it take for you all to understand that the access to water to basic needs is a human right and that every park should have water fountains on top of that?

We demand that the expansion and permanent for the funds for the emergency eviction program, these are demands that should enhance and will enhance the well being of our community. And we ask you to not ignore that our lives are being lost because of the heat. Do not ignore the housing crisis we're facing. And this budget that you're presenting is disappointing. In addition, as well to this meeting, it is extremely. We've talked about how the time is not accessible to people. But in addition, spanish speaking individuals are present in your meetings, especially those that are residents in Maryville. It is disappointing to see that you do not provide the adequate interpretation services for people to truly express themselves and how they feel. And what, again, these are community members. They're telling you what they need. Thank you. That concludes public comment. Any comments from council members? Exactly. All right. Thank you so much for that important update, amber, and all of the public comments. Councilwoman? Pastor? Yes, I would like to know how, what's the cost for the water stations? Mayor and council, I think we have deputy city manager John Chan, who's coming to the table to answer that question. Mayor Councilwoman Pastor Michael Hammett with office of Innovation has been working on the pilot water station project that was funded last year, and he can talk about the cost. Mayor. Councilwoman, the cost is about $8,500 a piece. And then install would be between 15,020 5000, approximately 30,000 for complete installation. That's correct. So how much money did we dedicate to this special project? Councilwoman we utilize the innovation fund that was approved by council during the last budget cycle. And so currently, we have five units that have been procured with the current fiscal year budget. Okay, so then we. I'm gonna go, 150,000 was meant for the stations or what was the cost? I mean, I know what the cost is. I'm asking how much money did we allocate specifically for this piece? This. This. We had about $100,000 for our innovation fund budget. This was a pilot project, and the idea was to identify new technologies that we could test and validate, that we could use to move and expand throughout the city. So it started in downtown Phoenix, and we used data to direct our efforts. And we had the first. We've got two units installed so far, and three have been procured. So that would be utilizing that original $100,000. Okay, so I'm just. I need clarity. Is it five that we are going to place with the 100,000, or is it going to be also two more, seven there? Yes, we have funding for this next fiscal year that we'll be continuing to move this along as we identify locations. So it started with the original in this fiscal year budget, the five. And then we've already got ideas for two more in the downtown Phoenix area, and including grant funding that we've been applying for. Okay, so what it sounds like is that this pilot program is being centered around downtown and. Go ahead. I'm sorry, councilwoman. Yes, it did start in downtown Phoenix, and we did surveying. We did community survey and business surveying. And so we used that to direct our efforts to start with. And some of what we found was near public buildings, near transit in high density areas. And also we used heat data from the heat office to look at where the calls for service were during the last summer's extreme heat. And so some of that was the tool that we created with the different data sets which identified this location to start. And a key part of this program, the maintenance and upkeep of the systems, was number one of those who we surveyed and we found a great partner in downtown Phoenix, Inc. To help us pilot that with the idea that we would find other partners like DPI in places like Maryvale, in south central Phoenix, and other areas that we could continue to move this project forward. So what I'm hearing is there are seven areas that have been identified. It cost approximately 100 and 5100, 150,000. That right now you are applying for grants to then use the heat data and call for services as to where the demands are throughout the city. Is that correct? With starting from the downtown core and then to build the network out from downtown so that it would be viable and sustainable as we move it through other areas of the city and council moment. We have applied for other grants. We applied for infrastructure funding in Maryvale. That was not successful. But we're looking for additional as well as areas around the southern part of our downtown. And we also just recently applied for a Gila river indian community grant as well for about $280,000 that would be utilized in various areas of the city. Okay, thank you. Appreciate it. I guess my concern is really is heat deaths. And I understand that for me, I think about these seven that only cost 150. I would like to see, if not in this budget, but I would like to see how we can add additional fountains throughout the city and be able then to use some ARPA dollars to be able to add this and spread it out to the city and then eventually get it into the general fund. To continue to add these type of fountains, we need shade and heat relief.

To continue to add these type of fountains, we need shade and heat relief. We know that we went through it last summer. Every one of us was desperately calling on other partners and municipalities to help us lift what we were lifting last summer. And we know what we're going to face. And I feel it. And the community did come out to our budget hearings to discuss these things. And so I find, I know we have 80 million, but I also think that we can look at possibly, I don't know what the right term is, Amber, but, you know, at the end of year fund of possibly saying, okay, we have this, this type of money, and to go towards this effort, I think it's important we're responsible at the end of the day for all of this. So those are my comments regarding the budget. Can somebody explain the 27 million mayor, members of council, I'll start and then I'll let Amber jump in. If you recall, back in February, when we walked you through the multi year forecast, we talked to you about a multitude of things that were putting additional pressure on the general fund budget, primarily leading amongst those was the class and comp study that we initiated for our employees at that time. We explained to you that that was putting upward pressure on the general fund budget for fiscal year 24 25 of about $52 million. We also talked to you about the upward pressure that we faced because of pension from 23 24 to 24 25. That was about $30 million. We also talked to you about the significant increase in the cost of vehicles that we have to buy throughout the entirety of the city, not just in police and fire. I believe those were about $19 million. So in this budget overall, from year to year, our general fund budget, as Amber has written in the report, is up about 3.5%. That is the same 3.5% that is represented within that police department, $27 million that folks are talking about. That same percentage would more than likely be evident across pretty much all city departments when you look at them from schedule three, schedule four, or schedule five in our budget document. The other thing that I would add, some folks had referenced in particular the fire department going down. The primary reason that the fire department budget is going down is because, as we saw the rain clouds ahead, as we talked about that multi year forecast, we used one time funds, capital excise tax funds, to buy fire vehicles for the next two fiscal years. So fiscal year 24 25 and fiscal year 25 26, we will be using capital funds to buy about $21 million per year in fire vehicles. We can use capital funds in fire primarily because those are large assets that have a useful life that exceeds seven to ten years. So that is why the fire department budget is down. It's really an anomaly. It would otherwise be up, just like the police department and all other departments. With that, I'll turn it over to Amber to see if she'd like to add anything additional. Spoken like a true former budget director. I was thinking the same thing. There's a man who knows his numbers. Does the budget include funds for participatory budgets which each council district or each elected official could use if they wanted more water fountains in their council district? Mayor, members of the council? Yes. Each council district does have their own individual participatory budgets, as well as yourself. We will also be going through another exercise at the end of June as we start to do our final reallocation of Arpa dollars that could theoretically also be another source of adding additional water stations. Great. Thank you, Councilmember Galindo Avera. Thank you. Thank you, mayor. Is it okay? We will go to the vice mayor next. That's okay. If you'd like to go first. I would definitely defer to the lady. Okay, just a quick follow up question. So in our parks, we have about 385 water fountains. How many of those are chilled? I can't remember. I know it's. Yes, it's actually in your packet, councilwoman, and I'm glad you actually quoted the number almost exact. So 202 hundred, 8384 water fountains in our park systems. Roughly 71%, or 290 of those are chilled. And then, of course, all of our public buildings are required to have water fountains. That is correct. Thank you, councilman. Thank you, mayor. I wanted to shed some light on the conversation regarding the water stations. The first week that I took office was also the district seven budget hearing. And I did hear the concerns expressed by many of the residents on the need for chilled water stations. In fact, it's the number two item that was requested during the budget hearings. And the district seven office has already began a conversation with the Office of Innovation to develop a strategy on how we can ensure and try and capture more dollars to add water cooling stations throughout the city specifically. Well, for me, I was advocating, of course, for district seven, but that's not the only district that exists in the city. So it is something that we've started to do, and it's something that we will continue to strategize ab", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Local Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "The network out from downtown so that it would be viable and sustainable as we move it through other areas of the city and council moment.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We applied for infrastructure funding in Maryvale.

Well, for me, I was advocating, of course, for district seven, but that's not the only district that exists in the city. So it is something that we've started to do, and it's something that we will continue to strategize about in terms of finding those funds, which we know already. The device is $8,500, but there's also the needed component of knowing the environmental placement of the devices because of the harsh sun in Arizona. So there needs to be some qualifying strategies around it, like where the shade is. The other component is ensuring that there's high traffic area to care for the water fountain because the current partner with the downtown area, they do, they clean the water fountains as well as care for them to make sure that they are not being vandalized. So all of those things are being taken into account. And I'd be more than happy once we have a better strategy and an idea to share that with the mayor and council. Thank you, councilwoman. Thank you, mayor. So I just have a clarifying question, Jeff. So we have the $25,000 that gets given to our office. But I thought I heard that each station with installation and all is 30,000. Is that. Yeah, Mister Hammett said that each water station is about 8500, and then you have about $15,000 worth of installation cost on there. So roundup about 30 grand. So you couldn't use your entire participatory budget to do one station, but you do have other discretionary funds within your budget that you could theoretically add and augment and supplement that to get to that number. But just to be clear, we probably, because when we hear 8500, then when people start doing the math, it's like, oh, you could do three, but we could do probably one and then have to use money from other places from your district budget. Okay. Thank you. And I think it would just depend how far you're taking the water from. If there is a public place that already has a water source on site, the cost is lower. If you are moving water a significant distance, the cost is higher. And Mayor Gallego. That's exactly correct. And what we're finding is we're looking for ideal locations where you can maximize the investment. And it can be if you have a system that's say you're replacing a just regular water fountain that's not chilled, if you've got an accessory to electricity, you can place it there and you have the sewer system as well as the water line. And the costs are much more minimal for that. So we can help with that. And part of what we're doing is making sure that we're looking at all aspects, as was discussed by the council, councilmen, about heat mitigation and also the upkeep. We want to make sure that they're in a place. We have heat mitigation technologies that are helping to preserve the chiller system so you don't have to replace it more than every possibly three to five years. So we're looking at all of that this summer through evaluation. Makes good sense. And it seems like there might be potentials to partner with school districts or other places that already have some infrastructure and activation in place. Wonderful. Also important to note, we have heard from a lot of people that budgets are tight right now, that our citizens are feeling stretched. This budget lowers the tax rate, so it is a fiscally responsible step in that way. Councilman Hodge, Washington. I also wanted to just chime in on when I heard the testimony, it makes me feel that many people don't know about the city's tenant eviction assistance program. We actually did a, we did some insight, some data on that at the march subcommittee for economic development and Housing. And one of the things the committee did ask, and I, part of the committee did ask them to go back and look to see if we needed to change our requirements, if there was additional funding that we could seek out for to strengthen that program and to extend it further. But we have invested as a city about almost $3.7 million in that program, and it's expected to at least last through December. But I've also shared and asked our city manager if there's any possible additional ARPA reallocations that can be done to fund that program even further if the need arises. I just wanted to take the opportunity to stress that we do have that resource available and I'm continuing to ask for additional funding placed in it so that we can ensure that our residents have a resource. As a lawyer, I recognize many times when dealing with evictions, it's best to have. It's usually more helpful if you have someone who can speak that legal jargon representing you. So I just encourage individuals that are facing those situations to check out the city's assistance program. So I just want to take a minute to say that. Thank you, mayor. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Amber and the budget team for the important update. This is not for a vote today, so we'll give the current team of second to step away and then we will move to item number two, which is a very exciting item. Sky harbor capacity planning.

Thank you, Amber and the budget team for the important update. This is not for a vote today, so we'll give the current team of second to step away and then we will move to item number two, which is a very exciting item. Sky harbor capacity planning. All right, item number two, Phoenix Sky harbor. This is an exciting one. Our airport has been hitting all sorts of new milestones. We recently released the announcement, $44 billion in economic impact. The Wall Street Journal has called us the number one large airport in the country. And the good news just keeps coming. We have so many businesses that partner with us at Sky harbor, families who make their livings there, people who reconnect with their loved ones. A lot of exciting activity, and the airport is busier than ever. I will turn it over to Mario Paniagua to introduce this item. Thank you so much, mayor, members of the council, this is exciting. It's very exciting to talk about what's going on at the airport. What's happening at Sky harbor is truly remarkable. What's been happening over the last few years. Growth is beyond expectations. Performance and customer experience remain at the highest levels. The accolades, as you mentioned, keep coming in. Staff at the airport are extraordinarily successful. Led by airport services director Chad Mikowski and his team, the Phoenix airport system is doing an outstanding job. Mayor, you mentioned the $44 billion of economic impacting, economic impact benefiting our city and our region and our state. A fun fact that maybe a jeopardy question someday is that that $44 billion is higher than the whole gross domestic product of an entire state. Granted, that state is one of our smaller states, state of Vermont, but still a big deal. That's 650,000 people and 9000 sq mi in that state. And that's what Phoenix, the Phoenix airport does for Arizona. We're a compact airport located conveniently in the heart of the city city, and we wear that identity very, very well. In 2022, based on takeoffs and landings, we were the busiest three Runway airport in the world. And that's a, that's a big deal. In 2023, the number of takeoffs and landings is going to grew by more than 8%. So we just continue to grow and we're so busy at the airport. The airport is an incredible community asset, and we're here today to discuss with you how we're proposing to ensure Sky harbor keeps performing at that high level for the decades to come. So I will turn it over to Chad Mikowski to introduce his team to tell you more. Thank you, Mario. Mayor, council. Mayor Mario, I think you did my work for me. I don't know that there's much more I could do in the way of an introduction. Thank you so much. And it's. We're humbled to be here today to talk to you about the work we're doing at Sky harbor. Some of the successes, but also some of the challenges that we'll be facing over the coming period of time. And I'd like to start by just acknowledging just my extraordinary pride for the services that our amazing team provides to our diverse and growing community. And we're especially proud of the awards and recognition that we've received for delivering a high level of service for the traveling public. We recognize we're the first and last impression of so many who come to our amazing city and our great state, and that includes being named number one in the Wall Street Journal as the best large hub airport. And this is not the first time. This is the second time in recent history that we've received this prestigious recognition. However, we can't rest on our laurels. If you've traveled recently, I'm sure you've seen that Sky Harbor Boulevard is becoming a bit more congested. Our Phoenix Skytrain is filling up, serving more than 40,000 passengers and employees every day. And our passenger terminals are getting significantly more congested as we've experienced near double digit growth rates over the past couple of years, and we're expecting more of that to come over the next year or two. Mario had mentioned that we're the busiest three Runway airport in the world. Another fun fact is if you actually look at our takeoffs and landings across our three runways, and you kind of do the math, that means about one plane every minute is either taking off or landing at our airport every minute of the, the day, every day of the week, every week of the year. So thanks to your leadership and the guidance that we've received from our Phoenix aviation advisory board, over the short term, we'll be investing more than $3.5 billion over the next six years, which amounts to. It's really a staggering number when you start talking about billions. It amounts to roughly $1.6 million in investment every single day over the next six years to really maintain and modernize our aging infrastructure as we work to keep pace with dramatic growth. And I think it's important to mention, too, that in our department, we are an enterprise fund department of the city, which means that no local taxpayer dollars are used to invest in our airport system. When you use the services of our airport, the money that you invest, when you spend, whether it's to park at the airport, to buy the ticket, to fly in that airplane, those are the funds that we're using to invest in our airports to support our community. However, we need to start some important additional work, not only in the near term, but over the long term to ensure that we ar", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport", "insights": [{"observation": "The airport is an incredible community asset with recent accolades for high performance and customer experience.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Sky harbor has been named the number one large airport in the country by the Wall Street Journal.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The airport is addressing congestion issues with a $3.5 billion investment over the next six years to maintain and modernize aging infrastructure.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Phoenix Skytrain is serving more than 40,000 passengers and employees every day, but congestion is increasing.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The airport operates as an enterprise fund department, meaning no local taxpayer dollars are used to invest in the airport system.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport", "insights": [{"observation": "The airport is an incredible community asset with recent accolades for high performance and customer experience.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Sky harbor has been named the number one large airport in the country by the Wall Street Journal.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The airport is addressing congestion issues with a $3.5 billion investment over the next six years to maintain and modernize aging infrastructure.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Phoenix Skytrain is serving more than 40,000 passengers and employees every day, but congestion is increasing.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The airport operates as an enterprise fund department, meaning no local taxpayer dollars are used to invest in the airport system.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 6074206, "chunk_end_time": 6473036, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagLEBwPtvU", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZagLEBwPtvU&t=6074s"}, {"start": 79000, "end": 85000, "text": " from our Phoenix aviation advisory board, over the short term, we'll be investing more than $3.5 billion over the next six years, which amounts to.

However, we need to start some important additional work, not only in the near term, but over the long term to ensure that we are prepared for what comes next. And with me today are assistant aviation director Jay de Witt and deputy aviation director Jordan Feld. Jay is going to provide you all with a sense of some of the trends that we are seeing and experiencing at our airport. And then Jordan is going to talk about how those trends are leading to some unique challenges for our airport and then ultimately what we plan to do to address those challenges. And so I'd be happy to turn the presentation over to Jay. Thanks, Chad. Mayor, members of the city council, glad to be here with you today. And in addition to the first trend that Chad talked about is we've reached record growth. 2023 was our busiest year ever. And I'll give you, I don't want to keep you in suspense. The trends are good. All of them are quite good. So I'm going to start with the second one, and that is the number of new locations that we're flying to. So as passenger traffic recovered since the pandemic, we've seen strong growth in new nonstop domestic and international routes with 144 markets, 25 of which are international. We've never served more destinations in Sky Harbor's history than we do today, and that's remarkable. One of those more remarkable routes that we've picked up recently is to Paris on Air France, and we expect more key nonstop destinations as Phoenix's economy continues to grow and diversify. As you'll note in this graph, passenger traffic has grown and generally kept pace with population growth in Maricopa county. You see Maricopa county there, and that orange line on top and the blue bars represent plainmans at Sky harbor. Some of the effects of the pandemic on travel are evident in the drop in passenger traffic beginning in 2020. Phoenix recovered much quicker than most us airports and in plain numbers largely return in 2022 and achieved that new record in 2023. Looking ahead, the airlines are anticipating big increases in passenger traffic in 2024 and 25. You see, they're about 10% each year in 24 and 25. And after which, we project traffic will continue to grow at a more measured rate, consistent with the past 20 years, about 2% a year. Now, while we've all been watching the airport's passenger numbers grow, an important underlying change in the passenger type has been quietly developing over the past eight years. This graph shows origin, pardon me, and destination, also known as ond, traffic in blue and connecting traffic in gray. O and D passengers either originate here in Phoenix or flying here as their destination. Connecting passengers, on the other hand, never leave the terminal, and they connect from one gate to another. You'll note that the ond and connecting split at Sky harbor was pretty consistent at around 60% between 2010 and 2015. And it goes beats toggles between 58 and 59%, but generally consistent about 60%. O and D and 40% connecting and traffic numbers increased over that period, but that ratio remain fairly steady through those years. This actually goes back about 20 years. This is a very, very reliable metric as you go across our airport over the years. However, in 2016, you can see that ond start to grow steadily from 61% to 70% to 71%. So very consistent over the last several years to 23 at 73% ond. And we expect, in fact, we're on track right now to about 75% in 2024. Now, this is important because O and D passengers rent cars. They park in our garages, they take taxis and ride shares to hotels and other destinations throughout the valley. And once here, visiting passengers have a tremendous impact on our economy. And getting that ASU impact study, the impact of growing passengers numbers are increased. O and D traffic is reflected in that ASU study and the airport in Phoenix metro area. Since the last update in 2016, this total economic impact has increased from 38 billion to 44.3 billion. And the economic benefits of ond passengers are substantial. But a strong o and d base also brings other benefits to the airport. Another chart. So this graph shows all of the 31 large hubs in United States in their respective o and d percentage. Generally, airports with high o and d percentage fall at the right end of this graph benefit from a more diverse mix of airline carriers and higher degree of operational stability. Note Phoenix's historical position at 60% there on the yellow in the left end of that graph, and looking to today, you see that Phoenix moves toward the middle of that group of large hub airports as its growth in ond passengers has contributed to more stability for the airport and greater economic impact for the community. Our final trend is a national one, as airports across the county and across the country are experiencing similar needs to build new terminals and make unprecedented investments in their airports. Mister Fel will now discuss some of the current challenges these trends are contributing to, as well as the proposed solutions. Thank you, Jay. Council members appreciate the opportunity.

Mister Fel will now discuss some of the current challenges these trends are contributing to, as well as the proposed solutions. Thank you, Jay. Council members appreciate the opportunity. So, in terms of challenges, a lot of our key facilities are getting older, right? Terminal four came on board in 1990, and you can think about all the kind of industry changes and norms around traveling since that time. So, to begin with, the terminal facilities that we have were more or less designed for a plane on the smaller side relative to what we have today. The load factor, in other words, the percentage of seats full on that plane was obviously much smaller than you would experience today. There's no extra seat to put your purse on, purse on, you know, in between you and the next person now. So all of these people and these larger planes are creating a lot of demand on our facilities. In our peak periods, it's not uncommon to see pictures like this. We're just coming out of March, which is, you know, typically our peak month. So this is what you would experience in our concourses or waiting in line for some of our retail amenities and even outside of the concourses. And this is really key, what the airport planners call that kind of the processing function. So the curb, the security, the bag claim, things like that. Those facilities are experience higher levels of demand than what they were necessarily planned or designed for. So we're familiar with the comprehensive asset management plan that we talked about a few years ago, the master plan for the airport and forecasting growth, and how that relates to expectations for facility performance. We recently brought in aviation consultants to help us kind of revisit some of those presumptions about the forecast and where we're at today with our facility facilities. And so the good news is, at least in the next couple years, our terminal capacity is probably okay. So what you're looking at here is a map of terminal three and terminal four. The red is terminal three, the gray terminal four. And you can see we're also adding a couple of aircraft position just west of terminal three that would be accommodated through what we call a hard stand operation. So a cobus or a bus that's specific to airport terminal mobility or access would take passengers from terminal three to those gates, those hard stands. So with some investments we'll talk about in a second here in the near term, we're probably okay through the near term in terms of terminal capacity. But as we look out to the end of the camp planning, Horizon camp looked out 20 years, you can see that by 2038, we're actually exceeding our capacity. So we're turning away business at that point. And most importantly for our customers, at the point we're turning away business, our level of service, the experiential value of sky harbor has diminished by that point. So we really never want to get to that theoretical point where we're turning away business where our capacity can't keep up with demand. So probably the most complicated chart we'll ever show the council. This is a heat map or heat chart, I should say, focusing on really not the concourses, but kind of the processing function of the terminal. So, again, bag check, security, things like that. And what you're seeing on this chart are the various key functions like check in and baggage claim. And you can also see that the heat gradients actually change over time. So you can, for example, the check in facility starting to reach yellow by 2025. But then there's an investment or an improvement in the infrastructure, some change that the airport's planning to invest in to make that takes it back to the green. And so we generally want to be in the green. But you can see, even with those gradient changes, eventually we're getting to yellow or red. So just to walk through that, the decentralized check in investments we plan to make in the near term will help check in the new and expanded baggage claim facilities. Again, in the near term will change that from yellow to green. And so over the next four to five years, we plan to invest 400 million in our terminal facilities to try to keep us in the green. But again, even with that investment around 2038, you can see most of these key facilities are in the yellow or approaching red. And that's what we want to avoid. That's really why we're here today, to kind of talk about how do we get up in front of that. Another challenge we have is with airspace and airfield capacity. Before people start to focus on that comment, not so much in the sense that we need a fourth Runway, we do not our operations forecast going up beyond 20 years never sees the operation levels at the airport going above our maximum annual service volume or what? Planner? Nerds. That's the term for airfield capacity. So we never get to that point. But there's always room for better airfield efficiency. So our Crossfield taxiway that we're working on now is a good investment for airfield efficiency.

Planner? Nerds. That's the term for airfield capacity. So we never get to that point. But there's always room for better airfield efficiency. So our Crossfield taxiway that we're working on now is a good investment for airfield efficiency. Another thing we've talked about more recently is in 2021, the FAA changed some rules about aircraft departing and hot days. And essentially the FAA rule says that pilots must request the longest Runway to depart on a hot day. The FAA is in Washington, DC. They think a hot day is 105 degrees. So Phoenix has its fair share of hot days where aircraft are asking to use the north Runway, which is great, except for the center Runway, is designed for departures. The north Runway is for landing. So the first challenge with it is it creates delay in the airspace. Delay in the airspace means more aircraft waiting to land. So there's some off airport problems with that and air quality issues with that. And more importantly, the weird red line that we drew around the airport here is actually our 65 DNL day night average noise contour, and that is the regulatory contour, the hide noise area. And what we always want to do is make sure we're not really changing the geometry of that line for the worse. We're not shifting it in some way. And over time, more aircraft departing off that north Runway will affect a change in that contour general shape and could create noise exposures in parts of the community that don't necessarily have it today. And so that's a challenge we want to avoid. So to solve some of these issues or just try to solve for some of these issues, as I talked about, significant investments in our terminal facilities, a Crossfield taxiway, we'll talk a little bit more in detail about the center Runway and what we can do with that to avoid aircraft using the north Runway. So these are some of the near term things we're working on. One of the things again we talked about more recently was by simply extending the Runway to match the length of the north Runway, we can avoid this growing challenge we're going to have of aircraft trying to use the north Runway for departures. In terms of terminal facilities, we're working on t three, n two right now with the post security connections, that will be a major benefit to some of our terminal capacity challenges. But again, it won't solve for a lot of those processor issues. Again, the baggage claim, the security. So that's really where the future west terminal kind of saves the day. And so you're seeing a concept map of that west terminal from the 2019 camp. And it's conceptual. So the specific layout and the number of gates and those things will kind of be determined as we refine the design. But the west terminal is designed very much like terminal four with a split roadway system. And the gate capacity is going to be somewhere in between 40 to 50 to over 60, depending on how it's configured, and whether or not we're seeing a lot of wide body aircraft in ten years, or the split of narrow body and wide body. So those things will come. This is a kind of graphical representation of the west terminal. Imagine you're standing above terminal three looking to the west, and you can see that the general layout of the piers, the roadway system, and the processor, the terminal, this is not specifically the design of the terminal. Again, I can't emphasize that point enough that we, we don't know that today the crystal ball is not that good. But in terms of kind of looking out in the future and industry trends with terminal design, this is kind of the state of the art. And we're always striving to be a world class airport with world class facilities. So things like sustainability and comfort within the terminals will be key to this. A big part of this will be efficiency in terms of designing and building the facility. We're going to need a terminal approach that allows us to be flexible and modular, add space where we need space, kind of react to what the market is doing in terms of the industry. So that will be key to this. That will give us flexibility, sustainability, obviously low impact to the environment, trying to use local materials, local restaurants, local labor, all these things are important, important incorporating technology and then access. And we can think about access in multiple dimensions. The future west terminal will be critical to international travel with customs facilities, more parking garage space, more transit access through Skytrain. So things like that. The bad news is these things don't exactly happen overnight. So there is quite a lengthy FAA Federal Aviation Administration process we need to go through. So we're currently working on the airport layout plan, which is like the regulatory map for the airport that the FAA approves to add the center Runway extension. We think we'll be able to complete that in this calendar year. And then next year we'll begin to work on some of the pre environmental documents that the FAA requires. But sometime in 2025 will start the NEPA EIS, the National Environmental Policy Act Environmental Impact Statement, which is a kind of long environmental process. If you're used to the airport, talking about environmental assessments for major projects that we can normally complete in about two years.

EIS is more like a five year process which has substantially more public involvement and community meetings and just scrutiny in terms of environmental consequences and how that kind of adds up to the ultimate finding by the FAA. Another quick thing to note about it is unlike other types of NEPA things that we would manage, the FAA actually manages the EIS process. Another reason why it takes a bit longer than perhaps we've discussed in the past with other environmental documents. So finally we get through that process and by 2032 we're able to kind of complete our design and begin construction. Obviously the construction process will take a few years and that's how we get to 2037, 2038. So it seems a long way off, but in government airport planning time, it's actually very, very near on the horizon. So with that, I'll turn it back to Mister Murkowski. Thanks Jordan, and I appreciate your comments. Mayor council, what I wanted to kind of close with is by sharing that this is a bit of a crystal ball decision that we needed to make. Right. We don't want to build facilities that sit empty, but we don't want to wait and then find out we have demand that exceeds our ability to plan for and build the facilities that our community needs. So we believe it's really important to get this process started now. I would much rather do it now in a kind of a phased approach. We can always slow down that process. If our airlines or any other entity or we have another industry event that slows down our growth for whatever reason, we can always pause. But we can't get that time back. So I can't delay and get the time back if I don't start now. So that's why we're here today, is to make sure you all are supportive and comfortable with our plan and our approach. And we'd love to get your feedback. We're going to obviously work very closely with our federal agencies, FAA, TSA, customs. We're going to work very closely with our business partners at the airport, including our airlines, our concessionaires, and all the people that make our airport work to make sure that we time this appropriately. So with that, I just say our future is bright at Sky harbor and we're really excited to be here today to share this news with you. We look forward to your feedback and we'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Thank you. Fabulous. Thank you. In talking with our residents, there has been so much enthusiasm for us to get to work on the new west terminal. It's very exciting news. We do have two residents here for public comment, so I'll begin with that. Is Cecilia Ortiz with us? All right. Followed by Eric Nielsen. Hello. Good afternoon. My name is Cecilia Ortiz, and I'm a passenger service agent at Phoenix Sky harbor airport. I am living with a heart illness. I am with congestive heart failure. I am also working with that disability. I love my job, assisting passengers with disabilities travel through the airport. It's an important job, a very, very important job, and one that is essential to the function of the airport. But I often rely on tips from these passengers to make ends meet. That's an issue. I wish I was paid enough to make ends meet without relying on tips from passengers, but that's not the case right now. That's obviously an issue. I recently heard, or I just recently learned that the CEO of American Airlines has paid $15,000 an hour while I'm struggling on $16 an hour. It really shouldn't be that way. That's an issue and a challenge. As the city of Phoenix plans on investing billions of our public dollars into expanding our airport, I am calling on you to make sure our tax dollars go to lift up the whole Phoenix community. We can't let big airlines and corporations cash in while working people like myself and the communities that you all represent while working people like us are struggling on poverty wages and passengers with disabilities are expected to help subsidize my wages. Airport should, airport jobs should be good union jobs that pay living wages, provide benefits like affordable health care and protect us from hazardous conditions. We have an opportunity here in Phoenix to end poverty wages for the black, brown and immigrant, the immigrant powered airport workers airport workforce and lift up the economy for communities surrounding the airport. I'm proud to be here with a coalition of working people from across the city who are united and determined to win a future for our families. Thank you so much for that testimony. We'll now go to council member testimony as we've had the other speaker, Eric, has departed. We'll start with our economic development chairman, Kevin Robinson. Mayor, thank you very much. You know, I want to make a comment about something, then put something out there for consideration, obviously further down the road. But Chad, I will tell you, and you and I have had this conversation. I have the privilege and opportunity to travel a great deal. And Sky harbor has always been, and I say this with, you know, with firsthand knowledge.

You know, I want to make a comment about something, then put something out there for consideration, obviously further down the road. But Chad, I will tell you, and you and I have had this conversation. I have the privilege and opportunity to travel a great deal. And Sky harbor has always been, and I say this with, you know, with firsthand knowledge. It's just one of the best airports I've ever been in when we travel overseas, wherever it happens to be, it truly is a friendly airport, easy to get around, get through, and everything else. So I truly appreciate that. That having been said, looking at the plans for the future Sky harbor airport and the conceptual slide that you showed of the west, of what would be the west terminal, clearly what does happen is it does away with the executive terminal, currently the Ragsdale executive terminal, which is currently the police station and such. One thing I would like to put out there for my colleagues to consider and for all of us to consider right now, terminal four is named after Barry Goldwater, terminal three after John McCain, both military men, both aviators, both men who serve their communities, their country. And we will have an opportunity to name the West Terminal or whatever it's going to be. I want to put out there the name of Lincoln Ragsdale, because currently the executive terminal is named after Lincoln Ragsdale. And for those who don't know who he is, he was a Tuskegee airman fought in World War Two. He was active here in the Phoenix community. From a civil rights standpoint, from a community standpoint, all the things that you would want, all the things you would be proud to have a building named after someone. So I will plant that now. It's something that I've had an opportunity to mention to Chad in the past. It's something that a great deal, a lot of folks in the community have approached me about it and wondering what will happen once the airport starts to expand, what will happen to the current, current executive terminal? But I think it would be in keeping with a pattern that we have with naming the terminals and considering Lincoln Ragsdale. So I put that out there. Mayor, thank you very much for the time. Appreciate it. Thank you, councilman. It would be so powerful to have a terminal named for a civil rights leader and Tuskegee Airmen. We'll go next to Councilwoman Hodge Washington and then councilman Waring and then councilwoman Guardado. Thank you, mayor. I wanted to also kind of echo a piggyback off of Kevin's comments. I do think that Lincoln Ragsdale was a pillar in our community, and I think that would be an awesome honor for him. In addition to his service on the Tuskegee as a Tuskegee airman, he also was a philanthropist. He has done quite a bit to our community, and I'm a bit biased. He's considered one of the East Lake legends. So I definitely would like to see us consider Mister Ragsdale in the name and honor when that time becomes appropriate. Thank you, mayor. Thank you, Councilman Waring, followed by councilman Guardado. Thank you, mayor. I think this was part of your speech, and I think that was the thing that got mentioned to me the most. After the speech, people were really fired up about this. People, frankly don't normally follow political speeches. We're bringing up the new terminal. You know, generally speaking, people, including myself, I would echo Kevin's comments about the quality of service and what I see. I don't fly a whole lot, but, you know, I think having just had the opportunity to compare it, to say, ohare, this is definitely better. My fear, when you looked at, yes, Jordan, it was an overly complicated chart, but I think I got the gist of it. If we don't do anything about 2040, we're not going to have a functional airport potentially, and that's obviously not acceptable to any of us. It seems like a long time, but really, time flies. I get what you're saying. I'm not surprised. It's going to take the FAA a while to sort all this out. It took them 118 years of airplane flight to realize on hot days you need a longer Runway. So I guess we should give them some dispensation for that. Having worked with the FAA, most of you guys missed that opportunity earlier in my tenure on the council. Count your lucky stars if you never have to talk to them. But I wish you guys well with that. But you are absolutely right. Start that process early. You guys do need to hire a publicist on the city council. And I think I found out you were the number one rated airport by reading about it in a paper copy of the Wall Street Journal. So I suggested at the time, I can't remember if I called Jeff or Chris Mackey, but I said, you know, you really should probably bump that up a little bit. I think it did get a. I thought it was a relatively small thing in Arizona republic at one point. That is the kind of thing that people should know. I think anybody who flies to Kevin's point would recognize the difference just from the experience level. I mean, it's night and day from what you're going to see to any airport back east, which is usually just a convoluted mess. And how do you get out of there? Trying to get to a car at O'Hare. I mean, that's just crazy. Nobody's picking you up. One thing I did want to ask, didn't we? We've always traditionally been in the top ten. I think it's in actual passengers.

Didn't we drop out of the top ten? At one point a couple years ago, we might have crept back in, but that was not indicative of a decrease in passenger traffic at our airport. It probably was just indicative of greater traffic elsewhere. Is that accurate, mayor? Councilman waring I'm going to ask Jada to comment on that. I did take a short four year leave of absence from the city of Phoenix, and Jay will be able to kind of lay that out for you. Mayor? Councilman yes, your memory is correct. We were in the top ten for many, many years, and in and around, I believe it was like 20, 1415, we did fall out, not because we lost passenger traffic, because some airports, particularly Charlotte, Las Vegas and others, really had some double digit growth consistently over a number of years. So we're consistently in that 1213 range and through the pandemic, recovered much, much faster than other airports throughout the country that we were in the top ten. In fact, there were days when we were the, the busiest airport in the country through the pandemic, and it's attributable to the resilience of our economy, the community that we have to support the airport. Mayor I will also say one of Sky Harbor's charms is it's not either impossible to get out of or out in the middle of nowhere, as some big city airports are. And now you've got a huge drive once you get there because that will frustrate your passengers. You know, they want to get to their hotel, they want to get to where they're going. You know, when we expand, is that realistic, given the Skytrain and the airport loop and the not on ramps? But I think, you know what I mean, the access points to the different freeways and surface streets, is that all realistic if you expand the number of passengers dramatically? I know they may come anyway, but if you build another terminal, they certainly will. Mayor and Councilman Worian, that's an excellent question, and it was a part of our camp 2019 airport master plan. We look at airport capacity, I call it three legs of a stool. You always look at your land side or terminal access, your ground transportation element. You look at your terminal processing element, and then you look at your airfield element. Three of those elements need to come in balance. And the team, while I wasn't here in 2019, and I'm going to ask Jordan to fill in the blanks, the team did look at that element, and obviously any additional growth of the terminal, we contemplated that in the context of the realignment and the additional work we would need to do on Sky Harbor Boulevard. I do believe, and this is something we've talked to this council before about. We do have a lot of cut through traffic that goes through our airport with no intention, intention to either stop at the airport or pick somebody up or what have you. They just use it as a means to get from one end to the other. Oftentimes that happens when the local freeways are congested. That's going to be problematic as we move forward, and we're going to need to identify solutions. The airport master plan in 2019 did identify a solution which could include security, plazas or vehicle checks, things of that nature. We are not contemplating tolling, but we're, we are contemplating other measures to help to ensure not only the security of the airport, but also that we can manage the demand for the roadways. We also, at 24th street and 44th street, we built these new Skytrain stations. And the idea would be that we can decongest the core of the terminals by bringing elements of ground transportation to those skytrains and then move them into the core via our Skytrains. So that's really going to be another important step to help us with the congesting the roadways in the terminal environment. Jordan Mister Makoski, you had a great answer. Marion Council but just to reaffirm the point that the master plan does solve for those issues, provide there is necessary landside area to improve the I ten off ramps into the airport, essentially just north of the administration building, if you're familiar with the campus. Less of a challenge as it kind of goes to the east side of the 143 and the 202. But for sure the facilities are planned for those issues. We didn't talk a lot about it during the presentation, but you may have noticed the roadway structure itself within the airport improves dramatically with the west terminal improvement straightening of Sky Harbor Boulevard. So some of those efficiencies are gained, and then over the next 15 years, we would presume some just efficiencies in the way personal automobiles and how people get to the airport.

Less of a challenge as it kind of goes to the east side of the 143 and the 202. But for sure the facilities are planned for those issues. We didn't talk a lot about it during the presentation, but you may have noticed the roadway structure itself within the airport improves dramatically with the west terminal improvement straightening of Sky Harbor Boulevard. So some of those efficiencies are gained, and then over the next 15 years, we would presume some just efficiencies in the way personal automobiles and how people get to the airport. And that function will improve as well. So we do think we have a good plan in place to deal with those issues. Mayor just to that point. So I had the opportunity. I know it was March, it was your busiest time, but I picked up a friend and took him back to the airport a couple days later. I was pretty surprised trying to think of the last time I had been at the airport before that it might have been a year. You know, I was pretty surprised at the backup of traffic going both ways. I mean, it was bumper to bumper. I hadn't really remembered that being the case. And then he was surprised when he got in the airport that it didn't seem that crowded. It wasn't now, it was March, but it wasn't. It was kind of midday. It was around lunchtime. It wasn't a time that really seemed like it was overly busy inside. Is that what you're talking about, the cut through traffic? Because it was really backed up like you would expect on rush hour on the 51 or something? Councilman? That is correct. Yeah. We showed another kind of complicated, nerdy graph back in 2019 that showed at certain parts of the day, the cut through traffic can be as high as 50, 60% through the terminal core area. As someone who drives a lot in our city, maybe you can explain to me now. I will say, I'll preface my remarks by saying there's lots of humor, behavior I observe where I'm like, whatever got in your head to make you think that was a good idea? And why would you do it again after the first time? Like, if it's backed up like that in midday, why would you do that? A lot of the freeways, you can move around unfettered at that time of day. So that doesn't make any sense. Can you put up signs saying, hey, dummy, you don't want to come this way. You'll sit here for a while. Why don't you go on the 143 to the 202 or whatever and save us all some aggravation? Is that. I know we like our cute signs out in the freeways. Maybe you could model that. I mean, given what you're telling me, it doesn't make any sense. Why would a person do it more than once? I did it what? Twice. And I would never do it again unless I was going to the airport. Councilman, great points. We actually have brought up the signage issue with mag and federal highways before, so it is something they know we're interested in, artificial intelligence and Google Maps and things like that. If you're from out of town and you ask it, what's the best way to get from point a to point b be? Oftentimes, the mapping, the AI hasn't caught up with the exact traffic levels at that moment, and it will tell passengers or people from out of town to cut through the airport to get to one area or the other. So that's a big challenge that we've also tried to solve for. We're still working on. Okay, mayor, I appreciate that. I will say at some point, deferring everything to artificial intelligence does have its perils. I guess I am trying to think of another city where it might even enter my brain pan. Yes. Google wants me to go right by the airport. That is a fantastic idea. I know it'll go great, but I guess maybe some of the folks aren't thinking for themselves, I guess, is what you're telling me. Okay, that's frustrating, but all right. Yeah. You might want to look at that signage and put up something like maybe a sign saying, if you come here, it's the journey of the damned or something. Thank you, mayor. I appreciate it. Thank you. We'll go next to Councilwoman Guardado, then councilmember Galindo Alvira, then councilwoman O'Brien. Thank you, mayor. I am not surprised. We are the fifth largest city in the country, and we continue to grow as a city. So, Chad, congratulations on your partnership plan. I think this is pretty amazing. I think starting early, I think it's great. But as we're moving forward and as we're making all of these plans, I just want to make sure that we remember the reasons why we are the number one airport, and I think at some point, we were the tastiest airport as well. I remember that as well. And let's just remember that because of the men and women that make up this airport that come in and work at this airport every single day, it is the economic engine that feeds our families, that feeds our children. And I just, let's remember, we've had many strikes at the airport lately. We've had Eod complaints filed as well. So we need to figure out, like, strong language that we be able to look at as we're looking into the new terminal and how we can avoid these disruptions that continue to happen. I'm very proud of the heat ordinance that we were able to pass a little bit over a month ago, but hoping that as we're looking at the plans and we're looking at what we're doing to better this terminal, that we're also looking at language that will continue to protect the workers and that will continue to protect the passengers as well, that they're not in line for an hour or 2 hours trying to get a cup of coffee just because there's no one there to serve them. So. But excited about the plans, excited about everything that is happening at the airport, and I think we're all in good hands with you, Chad. Thank you. Thank you, mayor. Councilmember Guardado. One of the things I kind of glossed over, and it's not lost on me, is that I have an authorized strength of about 950 employees. That help to manage all three of our airports in the city.

As you saw on that slide, we have over 47,000 employees that work at Sky harbor. So it takes teams of teams to make that experience successful every day. And we're very proud of the work that all of these employees do to keep our airport operational and customer experience exceptional. So thank you. Thank you, Councilman Galindo. Alvira. Thank you, mayor. First, I want to share my appreciation to Mario, Mario, Chad, and Matt for the really thorough briefings that you've provided me and for being patient and explaining some things to me. I think this plan is very well thought out. It's forward looking and forward thinking, and, and I think it really bottom lines what the mayor has been saying all along, that Phoenix is the future. And Sky harbor has been a first on so many different things, including use of technology. First, where you could go through and use your phone to show your driver's license. First airport in the world with autonomous vehicles doing great leadership and sustainability, whether it be some of the things we've done on energy efficiency and water use, to the actions this council has taken to move forward on renewable energy. Thanks to Vice Mayor Stark and many others, we've been real leaders on accessibility. Every time she travels, she's looking for a new way to welcome everyone to our community. And our team has helped, whether it be people with visual impairment or people experiencing dementia or autism, it's their airport, too. And we've worked hard to welcome all we know. Travel can be very stressful, and I appreciate that we try to accommodate all the many different needs that happen at our airport. We'll go next to Councilwoman O'Brien. Thank you so much, mayor. And thank you to Chad and your teams of, teams of people who are working at the airport. But I also want to thank all the volunteers who are there to serve our airport guests as well. They are a fabulous group of people. So excited about the plans. This is amazing. Are there any plans to have a dedicated international terminal at the airport? Mayor? Councilmember O'Brien, just given the unique domestic international mix that we have at the airport, we would not recommend a dedicated international terminal. And that's because currently, international only represents about 6% of our total traffic mix. But so many of our airlines serve both domestic and international destinations at the same time. And so that's why what we're proposing is we have an international concourse at terminal four today. We need to recognize the growth in international in Phoenix. And so what we intend to do is really look at an international facility in the new terminal as well. So there will be two terminals that have international operations within the airport. Okay. Thank you very much for that information. Appreciate it. And we'll have some planes are getting larger and larger, including many that fly internationally. This would be built with those in mind. Mayor that's correct. We would definitely make sure we have capacity for the largest aircraft that we would expect to see in our community, which is, we call them group five, which would be the equivalent of the Boeing 747. Now it's the Airbus a 350. We don't intend, based on what we're seeing in the industry, to accommodate the a 380, but we could, if we needed to, on occasion even accommodate an aircraft that size. Wonderful. And I think we'll see a lot of advances in sustainability technology, so maybe needed to do some great innovation in that area. We have gotten so much great feedback on some of the changes we've made. Very rarely do people reach out to the city when they're happy, but the Skytrain reductions of waits to get to the rental car center have really done that. And there are people who are just so enthusiastic. We will do everything we can to deliver this quickly because we know there's real enthusiasm. I'm working with the secretary of transportation on a committee that oversees or provides recommendations on project delivery. And maybe we can get things going more quickly because people are so eager for this new terminal. Councilwoman, Pastor, I really appreciate everything you've been doing because I've heard of camp for, I don't know how long I've been on here, ten years now. And the fact that we've done it in pieces and pieces in a great, we did a great community input piece where community got together and said, can we do this? Can we do this? This is what we would like to see. And so I really appreciate the effort that was done. I also want to recognize that we are the largest economic engine within the state, and in order to us to maintain and continue, we do have to grow. And growing means there's always growing pains. And, and to know that we're able to put what we have planned into play is awesome because I know with the specific rail and the military and FedEx and making sure we're moving the way we're moving, making sure that we're growing and the airplanes are growing bigger, larger, wi", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Sky Harbor Airport", "insights": [{"observation": "Very proud of the heat ordinance that we were able to pass a little bit over a month ago.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Plans are looking at language that will continue to protect the workers and passengers.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Sky harbor has been a first on so many different things, including use of technology.

And so really understanding the needs of today, but also of the future is very important because we can't miss our mark because we only have so much space in this time. So I really have a lot of gratitude at the fact that this has been a long term, ever evolving plan to get to where we are today. I would like to see actually more increase of flights coming in. It doesn't matter wherever the demand is to see if they can hit us or stop here and then go to their next hub. But really, it's just been incredible to sit and watch it actually going to roll out in the way it's going to be. The other piece that I wanted to talk about was space for concessionaires. That's probably another area of space of concessionaires. And really looking at is there adequate space? Do we need smaller space? Do we need bigger space? What do we need? Do we need kiosks? Really maximizing what we have in the plan. And then one simple request that I have. I don't know. It's not that simple, probably. I've been traveling and there's a certain airport that does a really good job with women's bathrooms and having the space that they need in order to put all their bags and hooks and like little shelves within the bathroom. If we could in the future look at that and see when we're redesigning what we can do for that space. Thank you, Mayor and councilmember pestor. We do not want to give that airport any undue publicity, but I will catch you after the meeting and find out who it was. So I do want to say one last thing. I grew up with. I grew up with Lincoln Ragsdale Junior and his sisters, and his father was instrumental in a lot of areas of impact. And I do feel that that terminal should be named after Lincoln Ragsdale.

Welcome to the April 17, 2024, formal meeting of the Phoenix City Council. We'll begin with an invocation and welcome. Rabbi Levertov. Almighty God, look favorably upon the elected officials of the city of Phoenix. Bless these individuals elected by the people in whom faith and confidence have been placed to legislate laws to make decisions that will affect the lives of the citizens of our great city. Let them recognize that this is not only a great honor and civic responsibility, but also a holy endeavor. The jewish tradition tells of the seven universal laws given to mankind by God through Noah, one of which instructs us to create a peaceful and moral society governed by law. Almighty God, grant that those assembled here be aware of your presence and their holy godly mission as they labor to enact just laws. This Friday, our nation will celebrate education and sharing Day USA, an annual observance recognized by our president, Congress, and many states, including our own, dedicated to the promotion of education and the values of sharing and giving back to the community. It honors the legacy and teachings of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. He stressed, education is not only the acquisition of knowledge, but also the development of character and the cultivation of a sense of responsibility towards others through acts of kindness, charity and generosity. As we face rising levels of hatred, antisemitism, acts of terror around the world, as we mark 193 days of captivity of 133 innocent civilians, including six Americans, let us do our part to make this world better by increasing in our acts of goodness and kindness. Let us reach out to one person we would not otherwise have spoken to, whether that means across the aisle or just across a desk. Let us gain inspiration from the words of Moses spoken to the jewish nation as they entered the land of Israel. You will have done what is incumbent upon you, so I will do what is incumbent upon me, says God. Almighty God, please guide our council members and city leaders through this very difficult time. Guide them in their deliberations so that they may govern with wisdom, justice, ethics, morals, grace, and compassion. May they have the courage to be a beacon of light, bringing honor to your name and your blessing to humankind and all of the people of the city of Phoenix. And finally, in order to do their own work efficiently and well, please heal their bodies, soothe their minds, and bring peace to their families so they can give their full attention to their sacred work. Amen. Thank you, Rabbi. Please remain standing, councilwoman pastor will lead us in the pledge of allegiance. Thank you, Councilwoman. I'll now call to the meeting to order.

This is another opportunity to take advantage of the bipartisan infrastructure law, this time through the US Department of Transportation's bridge investment program. This item, if successful, would reconstruct the Grand Canal bridge across the Salt river project Grand Canal. This bridge was originally constructed in 1927 and is the bridge of the highest need of replacement within the city of Phoenix. In addition to the bridge, we see the infrastructure signals, bicycle and pedestrian crossings of Van Buren street and 40th street, located atop the Grand Canal Bridge deck. We've had great partnerships with the federal government along the Grand Canal, including receiving a very successful grant in 2015, a tiger grant to upgrade the pedestrian pathways, better lighting, much more investment in safety, and just quality transportation corridor, particularly for people who walk or bicycle. And we want to continue the partnership. At last count, we have received 120 million in Bipar person infrastructure law funding. That's over two dozen different projects, including 60 million in transportation, roads, public transit, airport, and then another 60 million announced for clean water. So it's a great partnership and will really make a difference for the people of Phoenix. Any additional comments? Yes. Roll call. Galindo? Elvira. Yes Guardado. Yes Hodge? Washington. Yes. O'Brien. Yes. Pastor. Yes. Waring. Yes. Stark? Gallego. Yes. Passes 80. The good news continues with item 66, which is our general plan, and I'll invite our team to come forward. They have been working so hard on this. Many cities hire a large team of consultants to do the general plan, which is our ten year strategic plan focused on land use, but we did not do that here in the city of Phoenix. So Josh Bednarik and his team put in long hours to get us here today. Special thanks to Tricia and Joel and the entire planning and development department, as well as the amazing 16 member Phoenix 2025 leadership committee led by our three time chairman, Mo Stein. That is a true servant to the city of Phoenix. So thank you for stepping up yet again. Chairman Stein, you have assisted many mayors and city councils and has really connected the plans across the decades. I was proud to serve as vice chair the last time we updated the general plan to chairman Stein ten years ago. So thank you for sticking with us. We also had committee members who joined us midstream and didn't miss a beat, and we just want to thank them for the really important work they did. This is a plan that puts equity at the forefront, that looks at how technology is changing, looks at the important link between water and land use, and really says we are a diverse city, that we want to celebrate unique neighborhoods throughout, and multiple village cores. It was approved by all 15 village planning communities village planning committees, and the cumulative vote was 147 to four to one in favor. So very impressive numbers. Could those of us, everyone who is here who was involved with the plan, if you could just raise your hand, including our great commissioners who are here, so we can say thank you. And now we will turn to our team to provide a staff report. Thank you, mayor, members of the council, great introduction to our efforts. As we said with me today is Joel Carrasco, who has co led this project, and our leadership committee chairman, Mister Mo Stein. And we are here to present the 2025 general plan update. So for the past 15 months, we have worked with the mayor and council leadership committee, village planning committees, the community at large, and city staff to bring forth an update to the general plan that reflects the community's vision of a more connected phoenix. As you know, state law requires that the general plan is updated every ten years. But more importantly, we made a commitment to keep the conversation going with the community and to keep the general plan relevant as the primary source of land use, growth and preservation policies for the city. The general plan provides a purposeful and strategic alignment with our variety of city and community driven policies, plans and initiatives. Mayor and council, thank you again. And just to highlight, again, we did receive unanimous approval by our villages. Some of the numbers are there on the screen for you. So we are very grateful and thankful for all of their volunteer time and to ensure that this plan is really representing all corners of our communities in our city. And then shortly after that, we went to planning commission received another recommendation for approval, a unanimous recommendation with several revisions which I wanted to highlight in a couple of slides. And they were in direct response to the VPC comments and directions that we received and as well as responding to some of the 60 day review drafts. So, as was mentioned by the mayor, planning equity is one of the most significant changes with this update.

So, as was mentioned by the mayor, planning equity is one of the most significant changes with this update. And we took the opportunity after the Planning Commission recommendation for approval to more clearly express how understanding planning equity is a critical foundation to more equitable outcomes. And so that is one of the changes that you will see since the planning commission recommendation. To continue with that, we also updated one particular section in the plan that talks about downtown as our core, and we integrated one new policy statement on that page as well. Again, to ensure that equitable entrepreneurship opportunities are part of the future growth of our downtown and around our downtown. And then just a couple more updates here. We worked very closely with our aviation department and we had a few additional policies really to ensure there's strong alignment with the aviation department's master plans and goals that we wanted to incorporate in this draft before it came to you for your vote. And so there's one there on the screen for you. And then the next slide as well. And then lastly, another minor update in the memo that you received is the addition of ecotourism as a definition in our glossary as part of the 60 day review draft. We did get some comments about ecotourism and integrated those, and we just wanted to make sure that we included that term in our glossary with this final draft. And so now I'm going to pass it over to our plant, Phoenix committee chairman Mo Stein, so he can continue to tell this great story that we're telling with this latest draft of the general plan. Thank you, Mayor council. What a great honor it is for us to be here with you today. It was. It seems like it was only about a year and three months ago that we were here starting this process, because it actually was a year and three months ago. Normally, I can tell you that it takes two to three, sometimes four years to do a general plan. Councilwoman Matt Pastor will know that process very well. But this year we had a little bit less, and we had a little bit less because we were purposeful and decisive. And we have benefited from great leadership, from the elected podium and from our staff, and we cannot be more thankful for the work that Josh did. You know, Josh was our planning lead ten years ago, and now Trish and Joel have done Yeoman's work, not only doing their day jobs, but doing a little extra job power at it really makes a difference. We're really proud of this work because you asked us to be specific. You asked us to be strategic. You asked us to really look at what has changed in our city and what continues to change. Our plan is not just a code of documents and what you shall do. It is a real look at strategy, especially for land use strategy and how land use affects our lives. In Phoenix, that is a unique aspect, one of the things we did. And, mayor, you'll remember this. We looked at general plans from all over the United States. It was very difficult to find general plans that were strategic. We could find land use calculations and land use maps, but finding strategy was a little bit more difficult. And that's what we set out to do, was to create that strategy and to tell that story very clearly. One of the things we found out, and we continue to believe, is that people really believe in the story of this city. The story of where we've been, where we are, and where we intend to go is really quite important, and we tell that story in our general plan. In doing so, we changed the way planning conversations occur in Phoenix. We did that by creating the strategic, we call it the pyramid. But this time we've continued our pyramid, making just a few tweaks that I think are really important. We re emphasized, doubled down, if you would, on the idea that this is a connected city, and people want to be part of a connected city. That's not just transportation. That's about all things. It's about ideas, it's about people. It's about opportunity, and it's about the challenges we all face together as one community. Our three community benefits are extraordinarily important. Prosperity, health and wellness or well being and the environment. But we did something that I think was very bold, and most cities don't have the opportunity to do, which is we apply the lens of equity to planning. And we found out how that important that was to our citizens of all walks. Equity and planning just is something that you take for granted. And we're not taking it for granted. Our plan is based on the fundamental of how equitable planning is important to everybody in this city. Our five core values are extraordinarily important as well. This year we changed one, and we had quite a debate in our committee meetings. Should we change them at all or should we go less? The one we changed said to create an even more vibrant downtown. That's still really important, to create an even more vibrant downtown. And we continue to do a really great job in their challenges with downtown, we have to do.

This year we changed one, and we had quite a debate in our committee meetings. Should we change them at all or should we go less? The one we changed said to create an even more vibrant downtown. That's still really important, to create an even more vibrant downtown. And we continue to do a really great job in their challenges with downtown, we have to do. But it's hard to say that that is the strategic goal. And one of the things that came up was very clear message from our village members, and it's time to really dive back into our village model, maintain the model, but to encourage a real dialogue about what's happening in our villages. As it turns out, not everything is the way we thought it would be. Some things are much better. Some things aren't working the same way. Some things. Maybe the core isn't even the core. So by doing that, it allowed us to really examine downtown and say, downtown is not a place with a core. Downtown is the core. It's not only the core of our city, it's the heart of Arizona. And I think that that's a statement that's extraordinarily important in our general plan and why that works. And we replaced that strategy with the idea that we can create a network of cores, centers and corridors. It allows our villages, for the first time in many years, to really focus in on what planning is about and to really think through their core plans and their village plans in a way that we haven't had a chance to do before. Our staff is totally excited, I can tell you, Joel. Tell me. He won't tell you that. I'll tell you that. We're already getting phone calls from village planners and from village leaders asking us, when can we start that process? I think that's an extraordinary benefit. And lastly, our seven strategic tools, we emphasize one, which is I plan Phoenix. The idea that everybody has an opportunity to participate in planning in our community, and we encourage it. Feedback is essential. Our plan is not just an isolated plan, but it works with many community voices. There are two things that I think are really important. First, that our plan speaks to all sides of 360 degrees of any presentation. And I think you from the podium have seen that in presentations where both a proponent and perhaps an opponent will use the general plan to support their case and their presentation. We think that's extraordinarily important. And the other part is how important it is to recognize this is just the general plan. There are hundreds of other plans in the city. There are village plans, core plans, overlays, downtown plan, housing plan, other kinds of plans. We attempt to make some sense of order to that and how that ties together, which is something that we started last time. And we've been fortunate to be able to continue that process really well. One of the things that often happens in plans like this is that we spend a lot of time saying, what you cannot do. You cannot be this close to the street, you cannot be this high. You cannot be this way. We take a little bit more optimistic look and say, here's what we want you to do. We encourage these kinds of outcomes in Phoenix because they're good for everybody, and good planning brings great people and great ideas together. As we say, if you connect people and place, you get really great ideas. And we think that's what that speaks to, rather than to limit our opportunity and our innovation and our optimism, we encourage it by doing that. We simply don't take a whole lot of time on the land use map. Fortunately, there's a process to change the land use map. But I can assure you that had we attempted to change the land use map, we would have a thousand land map amendments, and we would be here for the rest of our lives. There's still a really good process. We encourage that to happen. We think our plan will encourage people to take a look at the plan and be purposeful about their recommendations. Next, of course, that this is a living model. And Joel talked about that. This is not something that sits on the shelf for ten years just like it has happened in other cities. But we report to you every year on our work, and we may even be bold and say what other cities do, which is to do a five year update where they dive into one specific item and do an update just on one item, and a mid course move. And maybe that's something that we could think about as we move forward. And then lastly, it was really important that mayor, I really appreciate your comments about what's happened in our work, but this is us. We had no paid consultants. We had no editors. We had no graphic artists. We had no writers. We had no photographers. We have us, and we're really proud of the fact, and I think it makes it even better, and I think it makes it more important to the community members who supported us and came out to thousands of email comments online, the cards that you saw, the little postcards that we had that people could write in and leave their messages, the public meetings we had all across the city that many of you participated in. And then our village meetings, not one, but three village meetings with each village so that they knew that they were part of this planning process. We're really excited to bring it to you today and really appreciate your support.

We had no paid consultants. We had no editors. We had no graphic artists. We had no writers. We had no photographers. We have us, and we're really proud of the fact, and I think it makes it even better, and I think it makes it more important to the community members who supported us and came out to thousands of email comments online, the cards that you saw, the little postcards that we had that people could write in and leave their messages, the public meetings we had all across the city that many of you participated in. And then our village meetings, not one, but three village meetings with each village so that they knew that they were part of this planning process. We're really excited to bring it to you today and really appreciate your support. And with that, Mayor and council, SAF recommends approval per the April 8, 2024 memo from the planning and development director and adoption of the related resolution. Thank you so much. Thanks for the great work. Before we open the planning the public hearing, any comments? Vice Mayor and then councilmember, first off, mo, you should be a part of the Phoenix Planning and Development department. You have done so much for that department. You have been such a great work, voice for planning, and I really admire you and thank you again for doing this another time. You've always been there for us. I was a member of the governor's growing smarter oversight council when they were talking about all the updated legislation, including taking general plans to the voters, and that was quite controversial at the time. But I think it was important because it really made us as planners, make sure that the public was involved in the process. And certainly your presentation day shows that you got to every part of our city and made sure everyone had a voice in the process. And so I really thank you. As a planner, I'm proud of the planning department, so, you know, I'm going to support it. Thank you. Well said. Council member Galindo Alvira. Thank you, mayor. Last week I had the benefit of a briefing by staff to bring me up to speed on the general plan and what I thought last week. I still think today. It's thoughtful, it's smart, and it's forward thinking. And an important aspect, at least for me and for district seven, is that it reflects the community and its diversity. So thank you for doing that. Very much. Appreciate it. Thank you so much. We will open the public hearing. We have three individuals who are very involved with the plan available to speak if necessary. Devni, Gabe, and Krista, would any of you like to come forward and speak about the great work you have done? Wonderful. We appreciate you being here. Any questions for the folks, including our commissioners? All right, close the public hearing and I'll turn to the councilwoman. Thank you, mayor. I echo my colleagues sentiments. I know this was a labor of love, and I thank you guys for putting all the effort into this. It's a great step in identifying what we want our city to look like. I just want to ask a couple of questions to help. Some of my villages had some concerns. I just want to make sure that those concerns were either addressed or we have a plan going forward for those. So if I could take a few minutes and indulge me by asking a couple of questions. For example, I'm going to start off with South Mountain. South Mountain had some questions about the implementation campaign and the next steps. Could you give us some answers or what the thought process would be for the implementation or campaign on next steps for this? Certainly. Mayor, Councilwoman Hodge, Washington, members of the council certainly. If the council is inclined to approve the general plan, and we will be back in may to refer it to the ballot. And should the voters, the Phoenix, support the approval, we will be working with our village planning committees, and Joel and I prepared to start that process this summer to start that conversation of developing a work program with our village planning committees to talk about our place types, the land use map, which I know is a major item that has come up, and to work through that program of 2025 so that we can move forward with some updates to the overall land use map and develop place types throughout the city. And I know I'm asking you to kind of do a little crystal ball here, but I'm just trying to address the concerns that were raised here. So thank you for that. The other question was presented from the Levine village that talked about some of the metrics. Sorry. I have here some of the metrics that they wanted to see included in the general plan. They included specific, measurable, achievable, time bound metrics for the goal, such as identifying corridors and exploring, establishing funding for infrastructure. Do you have any comments on that request recommendation? Certainly, mayor. Councilwoman Hod Washington, members of the council, I think that would also be a part of that work program with the villages so that each village could have input on how they want some of those things measured and what is important to them as part of that work program. My last one is a question from my central city village, which talked about requesting annual updates on the progress of these initiatives, initiatives as part of the village process. Anything you would like to add on that? Certainly, mayor, Councilwoman Hodgewashington, members of the council, it is our approach to go and do annual updates or through our annual reports of what the status of those efforts are to our villages. Thank you so much. I just felt the need because they'd have a little, they weren't an outright approval. They had approvals and recommendations. I wanted to make sure they knew. I read it, I understood it, and I wanted to make sure they had an answer as well.

I truly appreciate it. Councilwoman, Pastor thank you. Mayor Mo, you mentioned the villages, and I think it's a great topic to talk about right now since there is language at the legislation, at the legislature to really remove the villages and the process, or Joel whoever from the team, why do you consider the villages important to be part of the general plan? Well, mayor, councilwoman, thank you for your question. Villages have been part of our city since I was in college, and I got to serve on the urban land use planning committee way back when. The villages provide so many opportunities to connect people in place, which is part of our plan. It's hard. Not everybody can be down here at a city council meeting. And frankly, I don't think the city council travels to a whole lot other than budget time to have different meetings in the community. But the villages are made up of neighbors, and I think that neighbor to neighbor is where really planning conversations can occur. And I think it's so important that we maintain those kinds of conversations. And the mayor and council have been very efficient in providing a mix of people from all walks, homeowners, business people, civic leaders, people who've never been involved in community work before. That conversation is occurring on weeknights, after dinner or before dinner, sometimes on weekends, sometimes in people's yards. And I don't think that it can be replaced by a legislation, and I don't want to speak to the politics of what the legislature may do, but I think it would be short sighted to think that we, who were pioneers in the idea of bringing planning to the community, would be welcomed. The idea of bringing it away from the community. In fact, our plan in Iplan Phoenix, which is one of our tools, says we want that to occur. We want that regular review. We want to be held accountable. A good strategic plan, as you know, not just sets out the goals, but it sets out the accountability of what we tend to do about it. And we intend to be able to hold this committee together. One of the great things that happened with Plan Phoenix the last time around is we continue to have regular meetings with Josh about what we were doing and how we were doing it and were we purposeful? Did we hit the targets or are we hitting the targets? Did we miss something? And those are conversations that I think can continue to occur. I think that you all can be part of those conversations and should be part of those conversations so that we're doing what Councilman Hodge Washington is saying, which is to be accountable and to be representative and to report back on a regular basis that mechanism which allows us to do that. I can't imagine a more proud opportunity we have for people in our city to be part of that process. Eloquent, Lee said. I think the villages represent everyone within our city and the community, and it's very diverse. One of the things that, as a former village member of Encanto, was really learning my diverse voices within the area of the historic neighborhoods and the different needs and wants with the different areas, because it is diverse throughout district four and specifically the Encanto village representing the central core, but also going further east to 16th street, which is very different, and then going further west to the freeway, and it's completely different on what you want to put there. So I think the villages are important. I think one of our responsibilities as an elected is to really make sure our villages have diverse voices and also diverse thinking. And so I have tried really, really super hard to make sure that is happening. From advocates for affordability to advocates with height to infill, you name it. I've been trying to diversity. Some of them have been male dominance on some of my villages. So I've had to go back out and seek women willing to sit on the village. And so for me, it's about the represent our villages represent the representation of our diversity and being really cognizant as we sit here selecting people to sit on those committees. So thank you for that, because I needed to hear some validation of that we're doing a good job and that it's represented within the general plan. So thank you for everything. Thank you so much for all of the hard work. I believe we are ready for a motion. Vice mayor. Thank you, mayor. I move to approve the item for the April 8, 2024 memo from the planning and development director and adopt the related resolution. Second. We have a motion and a second and then a double second from councilwoman pastor. Roll call. Galinde? Elvira. Yes. Guardado. Yes. Hodge Washington. Yes. O'Brien. Mayor, may I explain my vote? Please do. I will be supporting this.

So we will go on to Nick, followed by David in person. Is Nick Ethier here? All right, thank you. All right. Good afternoon, mayor and city council. My name is Nick Ethier, a member of unite here at local eleven. I was formerly a member or formerly a cook for SSP America at Sky harbor airport. We believe that our employer, SSP America, is punishing workers in a discriminatory way for their union involvement. So far, at least nine union activists have been fired from SSP America since we first went on strike. And I myself was recently fired. If SSP believes they can intimidate us by targeting our most vocal leaders, they're in for a surprise. It will not be working. Even though I have been fired from SSP, we will not be silenced. And I will keep fighting with my coworkers. But we are here today because SSP America is your contractor and they are your responsibility. Do you think that all our allegations of racial disparities mean nothing? We are asking you to investigate these issues, not just blindly take their side. It's time that the city of Phoenix takes its responsibility seriously and for the city to investigate these allegations of racial disparities. And it's time the city really asks themselves if SSP America is the type of company that's best for the job. Thank you. David is next, followed by Isabella. Good afternoon, mayor and city council. My name is David Bonilla, and I'm a cashier for SSP America at Sky Harbor. I am currently on a leave of absence to work as an organizer with Unite here local eleven. So far, at least nine union activists have been fired from SSP America since they first went on strike. If SSP thinks that they'll scare us by singling out the most outspoken leaders, they're in for a rude awakening. Those tactics won't work. Workers will not be silenced. But we are here today because sSP. I mean, because Sky harbor is your airport. SSP America is your contractor, and investigating these allegations is your responsibility. Do you believe that these allegations of racial disparities hold no weight? We urge you to conduct a thorough investigation into these matters rather than simply doing nothing. Investigate SSP America and these allegations of racial disparity. It's time you get to the bottom of what is happening with SSP America and ask if they are the. If they are right. If they are the right fit for the job. Thank you. Isabella is next, followed by Chaska. Good morning, Marion, counsel. I am Isabella. I work as a line cook at the tavern in Sky harbor airport.

That guy was cool. Talk about speaking softly, but carrying a big stick. But what I came here to speak about today is something that seems to really be affecting city of Phoenix employees. And I saw an article on AZ Central about they fired this lady. Kind of the same thing these people were talking about in terms of they fired a lady who was like a janitor on the mayor's office. And I saw. I've never seen City of Phoenix employees swearing all over Twitter like that before. So when I come here today, I don't come here just to harp on what's wrong. I come here offering a possible solution to Jeff Barton's office, which, to me would I. But first of all, city of Phoenix are not really responsible, legally or financially for what goes on with their contractors. That's why they contract out in the first place. That's the issue of the problem. So I think the mayor's office and the Jeff Barton's office should work to identify maybe city employees who are contractors and have worked long enough for the city, then they should be automatically onboarded onto the city because Maria's story may. May not strike home to a lot of people. But, and I hope no one hope, I hope no one thinks I'm being melodramatic here, but when it comes to Maria's story, I'm immediately reminded of a man who stored out Hitler himself and won a gold medal. Y'all named the street after him. His name was Jesse Owens. And you know what he did when he got back to Alabama? He was also effing janitor. So I just want to leave you out with that thought. And finally, lastly, if anyone's watching us on Phoenix Eleven, please vote Democrat. I just want to add that a vote for the MAga agenda is a vote for world War three and nuclear or non nuclear, that equals at least a million coffins coming home. And lastly, I'm 33, so you want to get down with fascism, go ahead and do it, because it's going to be your children not me. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Matthew is next, followed by Michael.

On and off for the last five and a half years, I've spent in homelessness here in Phoenix. My original home was California. I was born and raised there. But I consider Phoenix and Washington, DC home. This article is actually from the Wall Street Journal this past Thursday. In the last five years, California has spent $24 billion on homelessness. Well, that 24 billion just got audited. The article is actually the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal. And the heading of it is California's homeless folly. In that audit of that 24 billion, the auditor found only two. Two environments that were actually fiscally sound and actually had, and get this, not even a good, but a moderate effect on the homeless environment. I've been sitting on this proposal for five years, between the pandemic and everything else, but for the last two, I've been knocking on the door of Phoenix with a proposal to help with the situation. Well, now, instead of knocking, I'm doing the camera, the ring camera, and coming here. I have a proposal. I'm currently dealing, working with San Francisco, because quite frankly, what's being done isn't working. I know intimately the homeless environment here in Phoenix. I know the people who work with the homeless, and I'm on the street dealing with the people. So I know exactly what's going on. You're doing the exact same thing California's doing. There's nothing you're doing they haven't done, and you're going down the exact same road. You're just doing it on a smaller scale. If California was an independent state with its 39 million people, it would be the fifth largest economy on the planet. You're just doing it on a smaller scale. And not only that, the auditor gave even the numbers of the growth of the homeless, hence why Governor Newsom is pulling his hair out. And I recommend he doesn't, because when I was his age, I still had a full head of hair, so. But anyway, I just want to leave you with this. Nobody even wants to look at it. They want to avoid it. Unless you start looking at it and really look at it, nothing's going to change. Thank you. Miss Taggart will be our final speaker. Oh, hi. I wish I could be there in person with you guys, but I have a very busy week with doing the Wallace and Ladmo exhibit at the Sunnyslope Historical Society and planning a panel now, so. But I just want to thank you for all you're doing for the city of Phoenix, and thank you for coming to slope fest this past weekend. Deborah Stark and Mayor KG. It was a great event and it was so much fun for everybody and coming to see our booth and learning more about what we're doing in Sunnyslope. And I hope you guys can make it next year, and I'm sure it will be even bigger next year. So I just wanted to make that public comment. Thanking you guys. I know you're very busy, but you took the time to come out and support us, and that meant the world. So thank you so much. Well, thank you. We are adjourned. But there was also Mexicans crossing looking to make a living early phoenix was half the population was mexican, mexican American.

I just don't recall item number two, and I just wanted to understand it possible, and then I'm ready to go after that. Okay. Madam Chair. Jesus Sapien, public transit director, is coming to the table to answer questions on the intergovernmental agreement with Valley Metro on the ride Choice program. Good morning, Madam chair. Members of the subcommittee, thank you for the question. Yes. Approximately one year ago, we issued an RFP to renew our alternative transportation programs contract, and these are taxi subsidized rides for individuals such as seniors and individuals with a disability. And we didn't get any proposals. So at that time, in May of 2023, we came to city council for an approval for a one year extension on our existing contract. During that time, we anticipate transitioning folks to the Valley Metro Ride Choice program, which is a similar program, basically a taxi based subsidy program for those same individuals. Okay. And the reason why I'm asking and is the right choice, is that like dial a ride or is that separate? Because I know there's three different pieces in valley Metro that separate out. Yes. Councilman pastor, it is separate from Dalaride. This completely leaves dollarite alone. This is only for individuals who choose to take taxi based trips that they schedule on their own, completely independent of dollar ride. Dollar ride remains completely unchanged. Ok. And that's what I need. I want to understand it because I've been getting constituents calling regarding the service. And so I just want to make sure that in this IGA that when there are concerns about service, where will that go? Will that go to Valley Metro and then Valley Metro will let you know, or will it come to the city of Phoenix and the city of Phoenix will then let ride choice understand what we're facing, madam chair. Councilman Pastor, it could come to us either way. If they're a city of Phoenix resident, we have staff specifically assigned to the alternative transportation programs that can take those calls, but they can also go directly to Valley Metro as they are the contract holder. However, as part of this IGA, we participate in Valley Metro special transportation program meetings, which includes ride choice. Okay. So we have basically some contract oversight. That's what I like to know because that's where things concern me. Most constituents get things mixed up like it's Valley Metro, then it comes to city Phoenix and we say we run the bus systems, but then Valley Metro has a contract, and then what ends up happening is we have a contract, so we really can't step in. And I want to make sure that we have some authority, oversight in our contracts to be able to fix what we need to fix. Council and pastor, I agree with you 100%. All right, thank you.

Then let's move on to item twelve, which is text amendment work program. And I believe Josh is here and Alan is here. Madam chair. Here to discuss the text amendment work update program for planning and development is Alan Stevenson, Josh Bednarik and Tricia Gomez. Welcome. Thank you, madam chair, members of the subcommittee. We are going to give an overview of the existing text amendments that are out there for the planning development department, as well as an update on the discussions that Mister Benarek and his team have had with all of you guys about prioritizing those text amendments so that we can bring them forward over the next few years. With that, I'll turn it over to Trish Gomes. Thank you, Alan. Thank you, madam Chair, members of the subcommittee. So as Alan said, we'll be discussing the text amendment work program and just want to highlight those three main drivers for text amendments, of course, city council and community priorities, legal requirements and updates, and then those that are privately filed. As you may remember, we were here last year in November discussing the text amendment work program, and we brought forth over ten initiatives that for the timeline, took us out to 2030 and prior direction asked staff to look at ways that we could bring forth some of those initiatives to the council quicker and also obtain feedback from all the council offices. So we have done that and we're bringing forth those that we think that we can bring forth in the next three years. So since we last spoke, staff has been working on the downtown code update. So that is one that we are ready to move forward. Housing continues to be of concern, an issue to address. Another theme that we heard a lot is sustainable transportation, and we'll go into more detail of each of these and then modernization of commercial use standards. The first, as we said, staff has been working on the downtown code update for the past several years as a city, as a development community, and as the community at large. We've had over twelve years of utilizing the downtown code and understanding what works, what doesn't work, what needs cleanups, what needs changes, especially looking at enhancing and simplifying the public interface so our streetscapes, as well as clarifying and simplifying our appeal processes. As I said, housing continues to be of concern and came up as a theme to address. So we have, we're looking at potentially expanding our single family townhome development to allow it citywide. Currently, this is allowed more in the central parts of the city. This also addresses a housing type as we talk about missing middle housing. Also to address other housing types or different type of residential uses like our nursing homes and hospice by looking at either reducing the special permit requirements, which goes through the legislative process, and replacing that with a use permit process, as well as, as we went through the ADU process in looking at parking requirements for duplexes and triplexes. We needed to clarify that, since as we're implementing those codes, that is not clear. Another theme is the sustainable transportation system. So adding electric vehicle charging to the zoning orange, which includes definitions where they can be used, how they can be used, is there incentives to provide those? And then as well as codifying multifamily and non residential bicycle parking citywide. And the last theme, which is quite large, is the modernization of the commercial use standards. As we saw with the ADU ordinance, we took the opportunity to look at our residential districts and reorganize that entire chapter, and we looked to do something similar for our commercial districts that would simplify all those commercial uses in a table format. Look to improve our standards and clarity for mixed use developments that we've dealt with over the time. Look at increasing entitlements for multifamily in our commercial districts, potentially replace use permit requirements that we have in the code for, say, just as an example, tattoo or massage with some conditions that could be in the code. Could I just ask a quick question? Could you give us an example of something that's a use permit today that might just become permission with conditions? Absolutely. So just as an example, NRC one, our neighborhood commercial for restaurants that have liquor inside, you are required to get a use permit. That might be an option that you provide some conditions for indoor, not changing anything with regards to outdoor liquor, but also tattoo parlors require use permits.

We've seen a lot go through since 2009. There may be some conditions to those. Okay, thank you. That makes sense. And then also adding some modern uses. These are simply examples. Microbreweries, microdistilities, but uses that we're currently seeing but are not codified in our code, as well as things to address our food action plan, like vertical farming and other items in the food action plan. And then another item that addresses kind of vacant storefront is really looking at potentially some development standards that would help our existing nonconforming storefronts, that maybe there's challenges in the code that prohibit them from getting new tenants and bringing them in, maybe addressing parking, maneuvering, or screening that would make those spaces more viable for tenants. And with that, this is the timeline that we propose for those four Texas amendments or initiatives that we're bringing forward. So downtown code, as we said, we've been working on it. We're ready to bring that forward. We look to bring that to the mayor and council by the fall of this year. And with that housing, starting those discussions this summer to be able to bring a draft to bring language to the council by March of 2025. Sustainable transportation beginning that in the beginning of next year and be able to bring something forward by the end of next year. And then the modernization of the commercial use standards, as we said, is a fairly large text amendment. By starting that in the fall of 2025 and bringing that to you by the end of 2026. Of course, as I started the presentation, we brought you over ten initiatives taking us out to 2030. Obviously, that doesn't cover everything, but just want to assure you that those items that we're not bringing forth in the next three years we are still addressing as we go forward, such as the drought and new development. When we have rezoning cases. We do include stipulations to address water usage, lighting and sign standards. We have been given a draft, so we are evaluating the viability of that draft as we come to you later this afternoon. Are excited if the general plan is to be approved. We are excited to be working with our village planning committees in their work program and working on a planning exercise that really helps to provide the information going forward about where density land use things are going that would help us further changes to our code to address housing climate action. We also include stipulations on our rezoning cases to address green infrastructure, our sign standards. We continue are looking for consultants to provide us those technical expertise and then for the baseline area overlay and Woocode is working with our transit oriented community groups and moving that one forward with that. I'm happy to answer any questions. First off, I do want to commend you for working on text amendments in the past that dealt with affordable housing. I think we made some huge leaps in that direction. So I know you guys can be very flexible, so clearly one of these may need to move up the ladder. I think we would understand that. Are there any questions? I have questions. Woman thank you. Well, how did you get to these choices? How did you. There are more on this list. And so how were they then chosen? I think there was more. Madam chair, councilwoman, pastor, members of the subcommittee, we met with all the council offices to really get feedback from each council office to see what their priorities were. And obviously there was kind of a wide range. And so our approach was really to be able to touch upon many of the initiatives at one time and group them into these overarching themes. Okay. Because I know that there's a huge list, and I believe they're all priorities of us. I just wanted to figure out how you ended up with this list. And basically, I'm assuming that this list is very fluid. So what? At one moment, we may be looking on multifamily parking reductions, but as we move into discussions and other areas of crisis, then you may have to flip to drought and new development. So I'm assuming it's just fluid and you will go where we will finish what we need to finish, but also then start something that needs to be started. Not that all of these haven't been started, because it seems like they have. These are ones that we can hit our low hanging fruit, I would say. Madam chair, council one, pastor, members of me, you're absolutely right. These are the priorities that we're moving forward today. But as issues come up or priorities change, we will make adjustments. Okay, so what is, I have several questions. So on slide six, it says, allow certain residential uses, nursing home hospice by use permit rather than a special permit. What's the difference between a use permit and a special permit?

So I'm assuming it's just fluid and you will go where we will finish what we need to finish, but also then start something that needs to be started. Not that all of these haven't been started, because it seems like they have. These are ones that we can hit our low hanging fruit, I would say. Madam chair, council one, pastor, members of me, you're absolutely right. These are the priorities that we're moving forward today. But as issues come up or priorities change, we will make adjustments. Okay, so what is, I have several questions. So on slide six, it says, allow certain residential uses, nursing home hospice by use permit rather than a special permit. What's the difference between a use permit and a special permit? Madam chair, councilwoman, pastor, members of the subcommittee, a special permit goes essentially through the rezoning process and ultimately approved through the mayor and council. A use permit is a quasi judicial process which would go through our hearing officer, the board of adjustment, and ultimately to superior court. Okay, why? What's the reasoning behind changing it? Madam chair, members, council one, pastor, members of the subcommittee, as we go through that process and you're looking at the impacts of those land uses, a special permit, sorry, has a more wide range of impact. These uses are small and localized. So really trying to address the impacts to the adjacent properties. Okay. The reason why I'm asking this is because there's an incident going on in my neighborhood right now, and there's a huge back and forth going regarding these pieces. And I could see this property owner or other property owners come in and say, well, we're going to use this residential house as a nursing home and hide behind that. And then we have to get NSD in the middle of it. And then it becomes a whole other piece of really advocation or advocates within the neighborhood to sometimes we have bad characters within our neighborhoods. And so that's why I'm asking these questions. Questions because the special permit would notify or neighbors would be aware of a special permit coming in versus a quasi judicial, and they really have to then organize themselves in a way to show up at the hearing and be able then to say what their piece is. So I'm trying to figure out how this changes with community input, understanding that the legislature doesn't want community input, but I'm an advocate of it. Madam chair, council one, pastor, members of subcontinent, both processes do offer or do allow for public input and certainly is welcome at every. Your special permit does have maybe a larger range of notification. However, the use permit is still looking at impacts to the surrounding area and takes in consideration public input for those. Okay, thank you. I just, sometimes I want to put things on the record. My final one. Madam chair, councilman, pastor, if I could add to that, that particular one is about allowing those residential uses by a use permit in your commercial zoning district where you could have a multifamily apartment complex, for example. But in order to do a nursing home, you'd have to do the special permit. And so what that is really intended to do is say in serving that type of population for where you're already allowed to have multifamily zoning, it's not, not that different of a nursing home type of use versus a regular apartment complex. Okay, thank you for the clarification. And I, you know, I agree with what's happening. I'm just putting things on the record so that community understands and knows. My final one is as this has been one in district four and downtown area sign standards and lighting signs. When I entered office, this was one of my first cases that came about. And sometimes some of my active neighbors or constituents get heavily involved in this space and end up in court. So I want to make sure. And if it's the lighting, if it's the piece that I had started with Alan, because there is a, in the downtown code, I think it's a downtown code where there's certain calvins you can have and certain luminas or everything else in particular with the dark skies advocates. Is this what that is? Madam chair, councilwoman, pastor, members of the subcommittee, yes. That is one aspect of the sign code that we are looking for a consultant to provide that expertise. We did several years ago bringing, brought in a lighting expert to provide some of that education and background. And so as an interim measure, we have been addressing that through stipulations of our sign applications that deals with the color, temperature and lighting shut off dimming things of those natures, which hopefully we can further as codify as regulations in our code. We are trying to address those issues in an interim basis through our stipulations of those cases that move forward. So now will this be like finalizing it? Because I think I've been working on it ten years. Yes. This would give us the opportunity to put that into the zoning ordinance. Okay. That's what I wanted. That's what I want eventually to get it into so that it doesn't become a back and forth. It's very clear and it's been by case by case, I think. Absolutely. Thank you. You've done a great job. Are there any other questions? Councilwoman O'Brien, I'm just going to go back to the point councilwoman pastor is making real quickly. What is the difference in range between finding about a special use permit so that folks would know. Madam chair, councilwoman O'Brien, members of the subcommittee, a special permit notification requirement for property owners is 600ft and neighborhood associations is 1 mile. A use permit is property owners with 150ft and neighborhood associations within 600ft. Okay. Thank you for that clarification. I am excited to see on housing, the expansion for townhomes citywide.

I'd like to touch on the sustainable transportation area, and I commend you for the two notations you have there. What I'd like to see us add, too is the micro mobility parking to make sure that as we make more parts of our city more walkable and whatnot, that we have that micro mobility parking available. Make sure I got to all my notes. And lastly, I would love to know when we could look at an option so that like with DMV, right. If I have to go do something with my driver's license or car registration, I can go to DMV. And sometimes they're quick, but sometimes the lines are long. But I can pay a third party vendor, right to go register my car there. I pay a little bit more. But when might we look at potentially offering some of our folks the option to pay to go through our process and maybe get through a little bit quicker? Councilwoman O'Brien, madam chair, members of the subcommittee, as a department, we're coming to you. We're tentatively scheduled to come to you on the May 21 policy meeting today to talk about process improvements. While that's certainly not something that we're proposing at that time, I think we can certainly have a conversation about the innovative things that we're doing now. And whereas you as a council, as we present to you the things that we're committing to do where you'd like us to keep going with that, so I think that would be the most appropriate time for that conversation. Wonderful. Look forward to hearing that presentation and May. And again, thank you for all your hard work. I know you have a daunting task. This is a long list of things to complete, and we'd all like it done yesterday. So I appreciate your hard work and diligence and trying to check things off the box off the list. Thank you, chair. Thank you, Councilwoman Hods Washington. Thank you, chair. Just had a couple questions. I want to start off and say thank you for the presentation. I was specifically excited to see that housing is set for our March 2025, tentatively, as you recall, the last time you were here before subcommittee, one of the requests I did have was for us to prioritize housing. And you guys, I thought summer of 2025 was being ambitious, and I'm happy to see that you're actually planning to actually exceed that goal. I know that the ADU and the parkin text amendment shows us this is a process that's very intensive, but I'm thankful that you're taking the initiative to do that. I just wanted to ask two questions. I see on slide number ten as well as slide number I understand the difference between the housing that is slated to be the tax amendments for housing that is slated for July 2024 through March 2025 versus the outstanding tax amendments in slide number ten. Is there a distinction, Madam chair? Councilwoman Hodge Washington, members of the public committee yes. So the initial housing is to address the or expansion of the single family townhome. So looking at that provision and then looking at changing from special permit to use permit for some of those nursing home hospice type uses, what's on the later slide as part of our work program for the village planning committees and as a part of the general plan, is to look at the land use map as well as exercises to look at core centers and corridors so that we can have a community discussion about where density, increased density is appropriate. Where are those land use changes being made which will help inform us about those future changes for housing, future tax amendments for that. So we think that planning exercise can help inform those next changes. Thank you for that clarification. That is helpful. One of the things I wanted to add us to actually consider as we do this text amendment process, I wasn't sure which process, which part it would fall into, but I think we should also look into providing whether or not amendments are necessary for alternative living arrangements such as co live in spaces, those types of things, whether or not that should be added to the. I wasn't sure which segment I should ask for that to be looked into. I think we need to. I believe in a variety of housing options, and that is one option. We definitely need to consider whether or not our current zone and our code makes it difficult for that. So thank you for that clarification. And then my second question was partially added. Sorry. Answered. When you spoke to councilman, pastor, and Councilwoman O'Brien regarding lighting and signs and the signage standards. Is the vision that they will be kind of consolidated or. We think they needed to be separated. And Josh is smiling and nodding. So thank you, Councilwoman, madam chair, members of the subcommittee.

I know you've been short staff, and you've been really trying to get the most necessary text amendments completed. And I appreciate your presentation today. Thank you. Thank you. Next is item 13, Parks and Recreation aquatics update. Madam Chair. Here to introduce her team for the update on the aquatics program is Cynthia Aguilar, Parks and recreation director. Good morning, madam Chair. Members of the subcommittee with me today are members and our management team from our aquatics division, we have Assistant Director Tracy Hall, Deputy Director Scott Coughlin, and aquatic supervisor Becky Kirk to provide you with an update today on the upcoming aquatic season. Good morning, madam Chair. Members of the subcommittee. Thank you for having me here today to talk about the pool season. We're really excited to open 18 pools this summer, 16 which will be open all summer, and two that will be open for one month each. As you can see, Solito will be open in June, and David C. Rebay will be open in July. These pools were selected based on geographical location, as well as ensuring that our neighborhoods, each neighborhood, has a pool to swim in. Throughout the summer as well as attendance, and those popular pools that are highly attended are opened as well. This is the greatest number of pools that we have opened since the pandemic, so we're excited to be able to have the majority of these pools open this summer. Our swim season this year will begin on Memorial Day weekend. It will be open over the weekend, May 25 through the 27th, open noon to 06:00 p.m. and then our full season will start on June 1, ending July 28. Every day from twelve to six, except for Fridays when we are closed. In August, we will open eight pools, one in each council district, for the weekends from twelve to six, closing on Labor Day weekend. This year, our programs that we're going to be offering at the pools will include our Cool Kids program. That is the program where kids kids swim for free if they are 17 years and younger. Sponsorships are the ones that allow these kids to swim for free, and those sponsors are through the Milwaukee brewers and SRP that have given us donations to make that program successful. We're excited to reinstate six swim teams this year. Those have been geographically located throughout the city and we are going to extend and our aquafit program this summer also to include some evening classes as well. Our adult swimming and our youth swimming lessons will continue the summer as we expand those. We also have been able to secure funding to discount swimming lessons at the majority of the pools. Not all lessons, but select lessons will be $3. Thanks to the diamond backs. This year we changed registration a little bit. We have two registration dates. The first one will be on April 25. At that registration time, we will register all classes that begin in the month of June, and then on June 14, we will register for classes that begin in July. We made this change due to our wait lists and the demand for the classes and to hope that this will encourage people to show up to the classes when we hold them. We have a lot of registration and a lot of no shows, so we're hoping to get more people in the actual classes after they've registered. Our recruitment efforts this year for our lifeguards include our junior lifeguard program, Lifeguard Academy. It started last summer. This is a program that we will continue and we've continued to have to grow our lifeguard health bench. People that are interested in becoming lifeguards, we teach them the skills during the summer when they're 14 years old, 15 years old, before they can be a certified lifeguard. So they get a taste of what it is. They spend their days at the pool and then the following year, at the end of the program, they get certified and the following year they're able to apply and work for us. We continue to do our neighborhood outreach and our community outreach as well as special events. This year we did our second annual polar plunge in December. We had a great turnout where we invited our returning employees to bring a friend, get them registered into a lifeguard class, and jump in a cold pool. So that was a lot of fun. We also enjoyed the second parade, the AP's electric light parade.

We also enjoyed the second parade, the AP's electric light parade. We entered a float and had about 50 lifeguards walk with that float and hand out. Recruitment materials were seen in the month of December when lifeguards really typically are not seen. We continued our high school recruitment by not just going to the high school swim teams, we included the PE classes. We went to high schools during lunch hours to talk to kids. We had actual presentations in some of the classes at some of the high schools where we could have a question answer session with them. And we included other sports, including basketball and wrestling, and in the different sports where we were able to table outside those events. At the high schools, we continued our social media outreach. That is a huge piece of our outreach with the Phoenix Lifeguards Instagram page and our Facebook page. And then we continued our shallow water Lifeguard program, which we started last year, where we certify people that are interested in being lifeguards instead of at 12ft of water. We certify them at 4ft of water because they may struggle with being at the depth of 12ft to do those skills. And then we work with those lifeguards to promote them to get them to able to do those skills by the end of the summer or the middle of the summer. Since COVID we have really worked on our wages. The city has really looked at what the wages have been for lifeguards, and we've incrementally increased wages to really make it marketable and competitive with not only other aquatic sections within the state, but other retail competitors that these teens will go to that are year round. And so, as you can see, a lifeguard in 2019 was making $11. For today, they'll make $17.72. In addition, we do offer the incentive again this year it was a $3,000 incentive for our pool managers and a $2,000 incentive for assistant managers, our swim instructors, and our lifeguards. And with that, if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Thank you. Are there any questions or comments? Yes, councilwoman pesor, thank you. I like it is three. Maybe it's the swim season I actually would like to work towards and maybe a huge campaign to work towards to open all our parks and be able to extend the hours noon to six I find difficult because someone like me, who had my child take swim lessons, usually got off at 530. And I believe there is a swim lesson at six. Where then I could, I went to University park and where then I, as they were doing the swim lessons, I could do swim my laps at the pool. So are lessons going on from six to eight or how is that working? Madam chair? Councilwoman. Passed to our members of the subcommittee. Yes. Swimming lessons do start at 06:00 p.m. and they will go. Depending on the site, they could go as late as 08:00 at night. We also have the swimming lessons in the morning that start as early as 945 and go until noon. And so that kind of sandwiches. The open swim hours prior to that 945 swim lesson will be when we offer the aquafit and or the swim team programs. It could start as early as 730 in the morning. Okay, so then that's what we're maximizing the pool and it's being used during that time? Yes, absolutely. Okay. Are all pools being used at that time? Madam Chair, councilwoman, pastoral members of the subcommittee, not all pools are programmed the exact same. It will depend on the number of staff that are allocated to that pool as well as the demand for the programming that is occurring at that facility. And so we will look at what the demand is from previous years and that's how we continually add to those programs. Okay, so I'm going to use Encanto. Encanto pool, pretty much any of their programming gets sold out or maximized and has a wait list. If I'm one that in the Encanto area and say I want aquafit because that one is another programming that gets full. If we know that Encanto naturally just gets old booked, where would be my next, strategically? Where would I go next? And I would work on more the east and the west in order to activate more the east and the west and north and south. But how do you guys look at that? I guess, how do you schedule this? And I'm coming from not a city side, I'm coming from a community college side where we look at our space and we start to then maximizing and start scheduling to figure out how do we make people move and go see different facilities. Madam chair, councilwoman. Pass to our members of the subcommittee. Yes, Encanto is completely booked. We do offer, we will start programming as early as 830 in the morning, go till 08:30 p.m. we would recommend. We have other facilities. Coronado Pool is not far from Encanto Pool. Madison Pool is also opening up and will offer some of those same programming. Perry Pool to the east is also available. So there are facilities that are around Encanto pool as well that will be offering some of the similar programming to be able. It's not much of a drive. Thank you. I just want to thank you all.

I'm excited to have more pools open this year. As a child, I have fond memories of Cortez park, so thanks for all the work, and I know it will take a while to build back up. Covid really hit you all hard. So again, thanks. Councilwoman Hodge Washington. Thank you, chair. I agree with Councilman Pass. I'm sorry, Councilman O'Brien. I know last year, the pandemic, following the pandemic, we reopened. We had, I'm happy to see that we're over half of our pools will be opening. So that's great news. I just had a couple questions, because for those that are not open, for example, in my district, we don't see East Lake and Grant being opened during this time. And I just wanted to know if there was a plan or any consideration to possibly transporting some of the residents so that they can partake in the coolness of the pool during the hot summer months. Sure. Madam chair, Councilwoman Hodge Washington and members of the subcommittee. Yeah. So this year, our goal, we have 29 pools in the park system. This year, our goal was to open 23. So the reason being East Lake is getting ready to go under renovation, and we're excited to see what that will look like next summer. And then as part of the geo bond, there are five additional pools that are scheduled to be repurposed into neighborhood splash pads. Three around the Harman pool regional concept in the bond, and then two around the Maryvale regional pool concept. And so that's why, because we're going to start on the design plans to work towards repurposing them into splash pads. Those were not anticipated to open this summer. On top of the staffing challenge issues, we have tried to transport youth participants before, especially in that central city core where you have a few polls that are not reopening that are part of that Geoban Alkire Grant University as well. We had some success at university. We didn't have any that took us up on it from Grant and Alkyre, but that's something we're certainly that we can try again to see if there's interest to try to get kids to the closest pool nearby. I would definitely ask that we make that a priority to try and see if there's more kids that we can partake of. The, it may, I'm not making excuses for them, but it may have been simply, it was something they were not familiar with. And now that they know it's an opportunity or possibility, they would readily avail themselves of this opportunity. So I just wanted to make sure, and I was not trying to be negative. I know East Lake is under renovations and as well as Grant, but I was just, just trying to give examples of parks that, who normally would have the ability to be a cool space for individuals during the summer. I wanted to make sure that they still had an opportunity if transportation was a barrier. So thank you. Any other comments, councilor and Pesto, I have a question. I've heard this. I've heard about splash pads and repurpose. When that statement is made, where the splash pads going and how are you repurposing? Yes, madam chair, councilwoman, pastoral members of the subcommittee, when we're talking about the five pools, the splash pad would go in the same location that the existing pool is in. So that would be a good project there to turn the pools into the splash pad also. I'm sorry, your second question, councilwoman, you said location. Well, how did you determine and how are you repurposing, and have you spoken to those council members about this? Because I'm going to lead into something else. Sure. Councilwoman, pastor, madam chair, members of the subcommittee, those were conversations that were had with Marin counsel when we were going through the bond process and then through that process and ultimately the approval that the executive bond committee and city council gave. And so the idea was that in the cases of Harmon and Maryvale, that there were two or in one case, three pools, in some cases that were less than a mile away, less than a mile and a half away, that the infrastructure was aging. It's harder to staff these pools, and there was little to no shade or amenities that we would give the neighborhood a regional pool that could be open more on a year round basis with more amenities and repurpose those pools into splash pads that would be open for even greater than a typical summer pool season. So they would now have an option of a splash pad nearby or a regional pool. That was the concept. Right. And I just wanted to put that on the record for community to understand what's happening, because I don't believe the majority of the community within those neighborhoods have a concept or understanding of what is happening when we're repurposing the pool, because what we're doing is we're regionalizing the pools and those, that pools of those areas who are historically in black and brown neighborhoods are now being repurposed for a regional pool.

We can talk at a very high level and have people on committees making these high level decisions. I'm not saying it's a good or bad. What I'm just saying is we just have to own up or be very clear to those communities why their pool is being repurposed. And when I, what I'm looking at and envisioning in a repurposed, does that mean you're filling in the pool and then you're putting the splash pad on top of it? I'm trying to visualize what is happening. Sure. Council and pastor, madam chair, members of the subcommittee, I'll actually let Scott maybe Coughlin just talk in theory about what happens. Is it the filling of a pool and how maybe just high level that will happen? Scott Madam Chair, council and pastor, members of the subcommittee what would happen in this case is the pool itself would be completely demolished and everything would be brought back up to native soil. If you've seen the splash pads at Mariposa and Elloso parks that have been built recently, because we have existing equipment there and buildings. So some of that may be repurposed to utilize for the splash pads, but the buildings would remain. So the buildings could be used for either a park bathroom or another amenity. University's building actually is historic, so that could be another amenity that could be used in that park. It has restrooms in it, and so it would make some minor changes. But the at Grant alkire, same thing. The pool would be completely removed. A splash pad would be built in its place, and that's generally how that would happen. But we would repurpose some of the equipment if it's usable for the same items, or we would repurpose the buildings. Does that answer your question? Okay. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you for your presentation today. Next we turn to cot to the public, and I'll turn to the city attorney to explain public comment. Thank you, madam chair.

Our first speaker, Lindsey Ruck. Good morning, council members. My name is Lindsey Ruck. I work as a server for SSP America at Sky Harbor Airport. We have been raising our concerns about unfair treatment by our employer, SSP, including allegations of racial disparities in hiring and pay practices. Workers have filed several unfair labor practices practice charges against the city's subcontractor, SSP America, alleging that the company has violated labor laws. In recent months, nine vocal union activists have been fired, including Jasmine Glass, who spoke out and was a whistleblower in the complaints filed with the city council. City of Phoenix, sSP America is your contractor. They are your responsibility. Do you think that all our allegations of racial disparities mean nothing? We're not asking. We're asking for a fair and get this unfair investigation, not for you to just blindly believe us. We have asked you time and time again investigate SSP America and these allegations of racial disparity. It's time you get to the bottom of what is happening with SSP America and ask if they are a right fit for the job. Thank you. Next, speaker, Michelle Hornstein. Hope I didn't blotch your name up there. Hello, members of the committee. My name is Michelle Hornstein. I'm a server with SSP America and Sky Harbor Airport. So far, at least nine union activists have been fired from SSP since they first went on strike. SSP thinks they can scare us by picking out the loudest leaders, but they're in for a rude awakening. Workers will not be silenced. When will it be enough for this council to take what is happening at your airport seriously? Do you think that all these allegations of racial disparities mean nothing? We are asking you to investigate these issues time and again. We have asked you to investigate these allegations of racial disparity with your contractor, SSP America. The city of Phoenix needs to step up and take its responsibility seriously and determine if SSP America is truly the right fit. Thank you. Next. David Bonilla.

Next, Speaker Jerry Van Gas. Good morning. Jerry Van Gasser, you have a handout in front of you that I provided concerning 2024 is the centennial year for South Mountain park. Back in 2017, three PI money, to the tune of $23 million, was approved for a complete renovation of South Mountain park. It's a five year plan, so it would be ready for the centennial. The five years came and went in 2022. We're nowhere near being done out there. In fact, there's some major issues out there with the infrastructure that nobody is explaining to their own personnel and in talking to contractors. Been out there since before Christmas. There's been no activity, no construction, and no answers. We want to know what is going on out there because this is an embarrassment. Our centennial year in the park is nowhere near complete with all that money. And you can see $10 million is supposed to go into the activity complex. And now we hear they want to take money and gut and renovate smeak, the South Mountain Environmental Education center, which was just rededicated by our mayor 18 months ago after hundreds of thousands of dollars were put into it. Prior to that, the zoo put hundreds of thousands of dollars into it. So you're telling me we've got to renovate this facility, which is the most prostituted facility in the park system, again, just to cover the huge problem that exists out there. We want some answers because this is already, you know, we want to see the contract. Our attorneys have put in a record request for the contract for SMEQ, and the press is aware of it. It's only a matter of time before they're out there asking these questions. Thank you. Thank you. Next. Isabella Renfo. Hello, members of the committee. I am Isabella Renfo. I work at SSP as a line cooker at Sky harbor airport. We have been raising our concerns about unfair treatment by our employee, SSP America, including allegations of racial disparities in hiring and pay practices. Workers have filed several unfair labor practices charges against the city sub SSP America alleging that the company has violated labor laws in recent months. Nine vocal union activists have been fired, including Jasmine Glass, who spoke out in was a whistleblower in the complaints. Oh, I have to go. Next is Tim Sarakowski. Well, good morning. I'm Tim Sierkowski. How are you guys? I want to go back to what Jerry was talking about, but more importantly, I still want to ask the question, why did you allow dumping from a construction site in South Mountain? Why? That hasn't really been addressed in the dirt that was dumped in the river and stream areas over there, which was really against all laws, hasn't really been cleaned up. So how come it hasn't been cleaned up? If you go down there, you're going to see piles of dirt from a construction site that was from a private construction site still there, and nothing's been done with it. So I think we need to sit back and ask the pertinent question, why? Why? This has been over a couple years. Why isn't it cleaned up? Second question I'd like to address is they're having problems with their water system at South Mountain. They have a generator at the front entrance trying to pump the water throughout the park system. This has been going on for four months. Why isn't it fixed? Why do I have to come here and ask all these questions? Because I'm just a private citizen and this is their job. Why aren't they doing their job? I do construction. So when they're telling me, oh, we can't do this, if we were on a construction site, I would be fired. We need to address all these problems. Why did it take two years to open up dreamy draw. It was really three years. Why did it take three years to open up Echo Canyon? We need to start looking at this and asking ourselves the pertinent questions. Are these people really working for the people of Phoenix in this area? I understand that it takes time to do these things, but when you have a park system in the centennial at South Mountain that was supposed to be having all these renovations and it's not done years later, it begs the question, why isn't it done? So if they need help, I'm happy to come down there and explain how a job site and construction site should be done, and I'll give them all my connections for all these people that can come down here and do the job correctly and get this thing done correctly. But we need to start looking at maintenance on the parks and doing maintenance. They want to open up all these other parks all over and they want to do all this stuff. You have to have a maintenance plan before you have an expansive plan of park systems. Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker. And forgive me if I blocked your name, Jaska Coggleshall. Sorry.

I'm so sorry. You're fine. I make jokes about it all the time. It's Coggeshall. Hello, members of the committee. My name is Chaska Kogeshal. I work for SSP America as a barista at Sky Harbor Airport. Workers have filed unfair labor practice charges against the city subcontractor, SSP America for alleging the company has violated labor laws in the recent nine months of my. In recent months, nine of my fellow coworkers and union activists have been fired since we first went on strike. SSP America is your contractor. They're your responsibility. Do you think that after all the allegations of racial disparity. Do you think that all our allegations of racial disparities mean nothing? We're asking you to investigate these issues, not just blindly take our side. It's time that the city of Phoenix takes this responsibility seriously and for the city to investigate these allegations of racial disparities. It's time that SSP. It's time that the city takes themselves. If SSP America. I'm sorry. It's time that the city asks itself that if SSP is truly something that aligns with our morals and standards that we profess. Thank you. That's all called to public. Next is future tip agenda items. In May, we have book trash. We'll be talking about the West Phoenix high capacity transit. And I think in June we'll try to add the water annual financial plan as a discussion item. Are there any other? I would like to add the south mountain. And regarding the three PI, if we're to get ready for it. Okay. Anything else? Then we stand adjourn. Thank you. Make this a better experience for everybody, for our educators, for our children, for our community. This was my first time doing partner with a principal, so I was very excited to be at union elementary. We first started off by just having a conversation to meet each other and to share a little bit about our school. What makes our school unique, but then also which really felt special, is she really spent time getting to know our needs. One of the things that we talked about were teacher incentives and finding ways to just thank the teachers all year round for everything that they do. We frequently recognize them with a no or a thank you card or something like that. But sometimes it's nice to get a little extra something to go along with that when a need arises, knowing that Mister Welsh now has a friend over here at United Way that he can call for something small or something large, I can't promise that we'll always have, you know, what it is that he needs, but at least we can put it on our list. We can reach out to our corporate partners, our community partners, and see if we might be able to assist. Valley of the Sun.

I haven't read the contract, and I'd like to, before I even speak, read that contract. But I just want to say briefly, as you all well know, it's getting very hot. Transit people are out in the open. They're not in air conditioned single occupancy vehicles. Let's be mindful of that, as we have pedestrians passing to try to catch these buses. And in the future, the light rail. And this contractor needs to understand those elements. And I'd like to have you look at the way that you're doing the shade, because it's form over function. Anybody that gets on there, an old Ramada would give you more shade than these fancy fans. Thank you for your comments.

We want to get you really interested in this item, so we're teasing you. Patience. And we're on. Thank you for patiently waiting. We're here today to talk about our bulk trash program. Right now, we are currently providing service to over 422,000 single family residents across the city of Phoenix, which covers about 517 sq. Mi. Our team currently operates out of four service centers, and those service centers each service 13 volts trash areas. This program currently collects about 86,000 tons of material each week. I'm sorry, each year. And if you think about that, in terms of our residents, that's about 400 pounds per residence. So we travel 420,000 miles annually with our boat trash units.

And based on a 2019 study that we conducted, we found that about 25% of our residents are using the program. You're probably all familiar with our quarterly boat trash schedule. And if you look at the map that's on the presentation, that's currently what our residents are looking at to try and find what is their collection day, what zone am I in? When can I get service provided for my location? And it's a little bit hard to read. We've been doing this program for about 30 plus years where we work on a 52 week collection cycle and we're looking to really enhance and transition that program into an appointment based program. The appointment based program is really set up to align with our customer expectations and the demand of the program itself. It helps us with utilizing new technologies and we can also, we're in line with how the industry has evolved over the last 30 years and how to best provide that service. Each of these colors that you see represented on the new map that's under appointment based represents a day of the week. This is important for us to make sure that we're having our resources all condensed into areas that we can collect and get done. On each of those days of collection, we see the future of bolt. Trash really is about again aligning with customer needs and the program demand, enhancing the customer experience, letting them schedule when it makes the most sense for their schedule and not based off of the schedule that we put out, as well as reducing blight in their neighborhood and working really towards smarter, working smart rather than going out and looking for piles as they are just anywhere within the city. So when we talk about the schedule, this is really an opportunity for our customers to look at kind of their schedule, what works for them, what are the days that work for me, and if I'm going to be out of town, I won't put out that week. And if I'm going to be in having a family event, I'm not going to schedule an appointment so that my family can come over and have a place to park. So with that and the availability of the technologies that we currently have, where we can take those appointments in, we also have the ability to confirm service. So confirmation that the appointment has been received as well as we have collected that pile. When the piles are collected on the day that you have had set for your appointment, we will be able to get that material off the ground faster than ever before. Right now, the industry trend is going towards an appointment based program. Sister city, Peoria recently went to this type of program last year and they're having great success with it. We're also in company with Houston, Dallas and Austin, which are other major cities that are looking to move to this appointment based type program. Looking at our current program and what the program will be in the future, currently we offer four collections per year and that's set at our discretion based on that 52 week calendar. In the future, we're going to have the availability for our customers to place an appointment that works for their needs and their schedules at their discretionary date based on availability. So they'll be the ones setting that date for their own schedule. We're going to take those orders via my Phoenix 311. If people are more comfortable talking to a live person, they can call into our customer contact center, where we're happy to put that order in for them. Also, for our placements right now, we allow up to 15 days prior to a potential collection that people can put material out. So it's nine days prior to the collection week starting, which leaves a lot of room for material to be out for a very long, extended period of time. With the program, the appointment based program, we're allowing seven days in the future, and really, that's to help control, again, that blight in the neighborhood. And we will be there on the collection day so they know that the material will be picked up on on that day. Holiday weeks have been a concern for our particular operation. Again, we're based on a 52 week calendar. We have 13 zones. In order to get everybody four collections each year, we have to stay on a 52 week collection cycle. And we've found, and through the feedback that we've received from our residents, that's not something that works for everybody. And so we get calls in particular on the holidays of New Year's, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, saying that they would prefer material not being out in their communities during that time. With the new program, we're able to block the days leading up and after those particular holidays to ensure that material is not out, and we're able to, again, keep those areas free and clear for their families. Can I just put a plug in? I think this is a wonderful idea. I actually went to. To a block watch event on Halloween, and the trash barrels were out, and I saw all these kiddos trying to do trick and treating, and these barrels were in the way, and it kind of made me nervous seeing all those children out. And also at Christmas, I know a lot of folks do light shows in their ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Phoenix Bulk Trash Program", "insights": [{"observation": "We're looking to really enhance and transition the program into an appointment-based program, which helps us with utilizing new technologies and aligning with customer expectations.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Transitioning to an appointment-based program will reduce blight in neighborhoods and get material off the ground faster than ever before.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Currently, we allow up to 15 days prior to a potential collection for people to put material out, which leaves a lot of room for material to be out for a very long, extended period of time.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "With the appointment-based program, we're allowing seven days in the future to help control that blight in the neighborhood and ensure material will be picked up on the scheduled day.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Each week 86,000 tons of material is collected, which translates to about 400 pounds per residence annually.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "We ensure material is not out during holidays leading up to and after New Year's, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, keeping areas free and clear for families.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City of Peoria", "insights": [{"observation": "Sister city Peoria recently went to an appointment-based program last year and they're having great success with it.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City of Houston, Dallas, and Austin", "insights": [{"observation": "Houston, Dallas, and Austin are other major cities that are looking to move to this appointment-based type program.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Phoenix Bulk Trash Program", "insights": [{"observation": "We're looking to really enhance and transition the program into an appointment-based program, which helps us with utilizing new technologies and aligning with customer expectations.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Transitioning to an appointment-based program will reduce blight in neighborhoods and get material off the ground faster than ever before.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Currently, we allow up to 15 days prior to a potential collection for people to put material out, which leaves a lot of room for material to be out for a very long, extended period of time.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "With the appointment-based program, we're allowing seven days in the future to help control that blight in the neighborhood and ensure material will be picked up on the scheduled day.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Each week 86,000 tons of material is collected, which translates to about 400 pounds per residence annually.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "We ensure material is not out during holidays leading up to and after New Year's, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, keeping areas free and clear for families.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City of Peoria", "insights": [{"observation": "Sister city Peoria recently went to an appointment-based program last year and they're having great success with it.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City of Houston, Dallas, and Austin", "insights": [{"observation": "Houston, Dallas, and Austin are other major cities that are looking to move to this appointment-based type program.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 355514, "chunk_end_time": 848340, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDIdQi8sSBU", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDIdQi8sSBU&t=355s"}, {"start": 9000, "end": 15000, "text": "t everybody four collections each year, we have to stay on a 52 week collection cycle.

And also at Christmas, I know a lot of folks do light shows in their neighborhood, so kudos for this idea. You know, the residents have spoken and we've listened, so we like to hear that feedback. And I think that we're very happy to be able to provide that service moving forward, because we do have the technology now to move forward and provide that also, looking at our service points currently, our program allows customers to place both the curbside and alley, which does allow for kind of anonymity of piles. Sometimes piles find their way into that are not part of a residence. Material that's put out moving to the appointment based program, we're going to have that curbside. That way we can contact the resident if we have any concerns with their pile. If we have any questions, help educate them on material that can go into the bulk trash program. Maybe our HHW program, but it allows us to basically be front and center with that customer that's putting in the order and then our size requirement. So right now, our program does allow for 20 cubic yards. In the 2019 study that we conducted, we did find that that pile size was not utilized by all of our customers across the city. The average size was less than ten cubic yards, which is what we have moved the program to. Moving to that ten cubic yards really allows us to serve as many customers as possible during the day. So those appointments were able to get to the next pile because they were not having overloaded or oversized piles. To give you an idea of what ten cubic yards looks like, it is a four foot high by 17 foot long by four foot deep pile. It's plenty enough room for multiple pieces of large furniture. Also bags, as you see here. So we don't see that anyone's going to have any problems with getting the material that they need collected with the size pile that we're recommending. This is also more in line with where other cities in the nation and within the local area are. They're between four to eight cubic yards. So we're still offering even just a little bit more than what is typically offered for this type of program. We do see this as being an opportunity for us to really kind of look at our operation and focus our attention on this particular operation. So right now, the way that what we're looking to do and how we feel like it's going, going to impact the operation is through our route optimization, resource planning, and being able to support citywide initiatives. With our current program, we literally drive every single street within the city four times a year looking for piles that may or may not be out, which requires us to have a certain number of crews out looking for those piles and providing service. Knowing up front where those piles are and where the appointments are allows us to identify how many crews we need for the day and really shift those resources where we have or need the focus. So if we have the appointments, we'll put them into our boat trash program. If we don't have the same number of appointments that day, we can move people to our contained collections. So if you think about your refuse and your recycled containers, those also those swios, when we have open routes, we can move them over to help with that operation, but it also helps with proactive activities such as illegal dumping, cleanup, and as well as so being able to shift resources to different parts of the operation. And then as far as how we can support citywide initiatives. While we don't see this as being something that's going to be immediate, we do feel like this will help support our Phoenix climate action plan by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions through the first couple of years. We're going to be working on change management with our residents. So there's going to be a lot of rework going back to communities, making sure we're collecting piles as well. We go along, but once we get everybody converted over to this, we'll be able to go direct to the pile and then go directly to the next pile without having to search for those piles, which will reduce our overall miles. We're also starting today and moving onward, we're going to be doing a lot of community outreach. So some of the areas that we're going to be focused on, one is providing everything that we do in both English and Spanish to get to all of the residents possibly can.

Those physical addresses are really what's gonna help us because that gets to the person that's doing or providing or putting out the bolt trash for service. This isn't going to go to an owner that lives in California. It's going to go to the renter that actually is in the property. And then lastly, we're updating our Phoenix website as well as our call center notifications. And really, the point of this community outreach is again, education, education, education. So it's really going to be focused. Even though we have May through September on this slide, it will be ongoing this is not going to end in September when we go live with the program, it will continue throughout the next couple of years, working with the community to get the message out. So launching the program, we are going to go live with our bolt trash scheduler in late August. So about August 30, August 31, you'll see that come live onto the website. We are then going live where we start our appointment based program starting September 30 of 2024, right before the holiday season to try and get those on an appointment based program. And then lastly, ongoing outreach. And we just mentioned this. This is really about community engagement and getting out there, getting the message out there, having them understand the new program, help them with where they can go for resources regarding the program. And it's a time for us between now and the launch and then into the launch of working with customers and working with communities as they need for any maybe special circumstances. They have. You mentioned the luminaria. We know that that's one of the programs that we want to reach out to them and make sure that we have that community engaged. And they know when they're having their event. We don't go into that neighborhood and we keep it free of blight during that time period. So there's many opportunities across the city to engage in that type of work. So we're excited about the new program. I thank you for letting us come here today. And with that, we're ready to answer any questions you may have. Thank you. We actually have one speaker. Should we take the speaker first? Okay. That would be James Wyatt Emark neutral. Thank you. Just a couple of questions. So you mentioned alleys are going to go to streets. Have you engaged in those folks yet that, hey, you're not. You're going to have to put this stuff in the, in the front. That would be number one. The other one of concern is currently we get street sweeping four times a year. How do you continue, how do you plan on continuing that piece? If, and how do you, and let me follow that up with if there's five of us on the block, we could technically have piles out for five different weeks. You guys could be in the same block five times in the same month. So how do you plan to reduce that? If you can answer those questions, maybe when we chatted about it, you talked a little bit about how it really will be more cost effective. Madam chair, members of the subcommittee, thank you for that question. In terms of managing the driving around, as you know, we drive every street every week with full crews looking for piles. We still will be in a zone based area. So if you live in a Tuesday part of town, we have resources for Tuesday. And we'll be driving with purpose rather than just driving looking. And so there's still the ability to go point to point and route for those efficient appointments versus just driving an area of the street. And over time, we feel like that's going to reduce miles. And we see reduction in tonnage because of the lack of, again, 25% of the customers are using the program, but 100% of our resources are out there driving everywhere. And so that's one of the things. The other is we do need to work and coordinate with streets department on the street sweeping component. That's a good point. Just to ensure that we can continue to keep things clean, clean and tidy. And then the last point with alleys. And this is part of, as we go live, really working on that education with residents, with our community to understand the shift of how we need to put the bulk trash to the curb when they make that appointment. My hat's off to you. Over the alleys. However, I hope you have your Kevlar jacket on for those of us that have seen that. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Wyatt. Appreciate. Are there any questions, Councilwoman O'Brien? So I don't have a whole lot of questions. Actually, I want to just say thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Because in 22, the bulk trash schedule changed, which put all of district one on a schedule that hit all of those major holidays. And so for the first time in.

My hat's off to you. Over the alleys. However, I hope you have your Kevlar jacket on for those of us that have seen that. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Wyatt. Appreciate. Are there any questions, Councilwoman O'Brien? So I don't have a whole lot of questions. Actually, I want to just say thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Because in 22, the bulk trash schedule changed, which put all of district one on a schedule that hit all of those major holidays. And so for the first time in. In years, maybe decades, so the complaints came flooding into my office about having bulk trash Christmas and New Year's Eve week. So in January of 23, I came to you all and said, help, what can you do? And so I am so appreciative of this new program for a multitude of reasons. One, it will make my constituents happier, but to doing this with a purpose and also allowing our constituents to have it when it is best for them. Our schedule doesn't always align with when is the proper time to trim all your trees and landscaping. So I really am so thankful for this, and I'm excited about having resources to be more efficiently and effectively disperse through our city, as well as having opportunities to do other things. So thank you to you, Felipe and Justine, for putting this program together. I know that change is difficult. Not everybody will love it, but I think as we get through this, and I'm like said, however we can help communicate it for you, please let us know. Thank you. Councilwoman Hodge, Washington. Thank you, chair. I had a couple questions one of which was asked by our speakers. So that's already taken care of. The other question I wanted to say, first of all, I appreciate the transition to a more customer demand based system, so that oftentimes, as mentioned, the pre printing schedule doesn't always work at the right time. So this is, is definitely helping us move towards addressing the needs of the citizens of Phoenix. I just want to talk a little bit about, it's a question I raised when we were briefed on this, and I just want you to explain, for those that live in an HOA, and how does a neighbor know or find out whether or not that pile has been called in and what level of coordination or communication we intend to do with the, you know, those neighborhood associations to ensure that this information gets out to the right people. Because we do not want this to become more of a blight situation, but more of a learning and educational process. So thank you, Madam Chair. Councilman Hodgewatch. That's a great question. Thank you for asking. That is something that we, even under the current program, we work a lot with hoas, and even the current rules don't always align with certain HOA rules and their CC and ours. And so one of the things we're going to be working hot and heavy on from now to the launch is to actually get a list of those hoas, start reaching out proactively with their leaders, talking about the change, and then a better understanding. How can we support. Okay, would you like to schedule this on behalf of your community, or are you okay with allowing them to schedule their own appointments with the understanding that it is a schedule based. And so you may see a pile here and there, and not just all in one week. We also have a lot of communities that have special circumstances, like private drives where a heavy truck doesn't fit or shouldn't be on there because there are certain safety considerations or damage that we might cause. So we've always worked carefully with those communities to figure out a solution, a creative solution, and we'll work case by case. So it's not a cookie cutter approach, and we're not very black and white with our rules, because we do understand all communities are not created equal. They all have unique setups, and we want to honor that as we work to provide the risks that works for them. And so we are going to proactively reach out, especially with HoA leaders, to better understand how we can best service that community on the front end. Thank you so much for that. I will just add, as someone who has served in one of those esteemed roles. I would also recommend that in addition, talking to the actual leadership at the HOA, that we also possibly consider speaking to the property management companies, because sometimes you will see transition of leadership in that role and we just make sure your message is actually relayed. And then the other thing I would like to ask us to consider is some level of I believe in metrics. I believe in capturing the efficiency of the effectiveness of this. So if we can keep track of whether or not this is, how much time it is saving and those types of metrics to show that it is working the way we intended, I believe that if you don't track something, you can't firmly say that it has made this net effect. So I just want to encourage us to do that. 100% metrics. If it's not measured, it's not done. And so we will be making sure we track data to understand how we are, how this program is performing. We'd like to come back in a year and actually present this again and talk about what we've learned, what we saved. But we do understand there is going to be a lot of change management on the front end. It might not look pretty and we might see all those savings right out the gate because we do want to work and help the residents transition to a program that's been in existence forever. But we will be measuring every data point. Thank you so much. We all know change is sometimes difficult to accept, but that doesn't mean it's not a good thing.

So thank you for all that you do, and I look forward to seeing the results. Yes, and I want to thank you as well. When we were talking about it yesterday, the other added bonus is usually during the summer, our bulk trash percentage goes down and we have our staff out there driving in an open air vehicle and it gets pretty hot. So maybe we can help out our staff a little bit during the hot parts of the year. Vice mayor, that's a great point because we see that tonnage drop in the summer, but yet we're staffed up for the full day. It will allow us to, to better allocate our resources to get them out of the sun at the hottest point of the day and get them in on time, and then we can put them in other areas of the operation that are less heat intensive. And so we are looking forward to that in support of our heat mitigation plan as well. Yeah, I think that's great. And I'm sure you'll get a list from all the districts with regards to people that we want you to reach out to. I just want to note that chair, councilwoman pastor has joined us by phone. We're talking about, well, trash. Did you have any questions, councilwoman? No, I'm just. I'm just. No, thank you, chairwoman. I'm just thankful for the changes. Felipe and I and staff went round and round and I discussed different scenarios with them and how it was, and they had an answer, a great answer for everybody constituent that I would know would be calling me. So I just want to thank staff for the changes. Thank you. Thank you. Are there any other questions? All right, I don't think we have a motion on this one. You're just going to do it, but with our help. Thank you. Next is item seven, which is the water services department financial plan. Here to update you on the water services financial plan is deputy city manager Ginger Spencer, along with water services director Troy Hayes. Thank you. Deputy city manager, Paniagua. Vice mayor, members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to give an update on the water services department's financial plan. I want to say we're still having technical difficulties, so we're going to go without the presentation today. What we are here to present, though, is the five year financial plan. We are coming back every year as we promised to mayor and council that we would do to give you our annual update. And so mayor and council, in June of 2023, approved the latest round of rate increases for the water services department. And those rate increases basically take us throughout 2025, the five year plan that we're presenting today. It does show an increase, a projected increase. Again, it's just a forecast at this time in year four. And so on the water side, it's from 5% to 7%. And then we're also projecting numbers for year five as well. On the wastewater side, we are projecting, again, it change, everything stays the same, same. But in year four, we are projecting from 9% to 12%. And then we also have the projections for year five. I would like to say we are not asking for a rate increase at this time. We're here just to provide the annual update and to also say that it's still early. We will continue to track our expenditures, our revenues. We'll continue to be a lean operation and also look for grant opportunities. And so with that, I'll turn it over to our water services director, Mister Troy Hayes. Thanks, Ginger. It's almost like a mic drop right of. That's exactly what we're here to do. So, vice mayor, members of the subcommittee, thank you for having us today. As pointed out, we are here this morning to discuss the latest update that we have to our water and wastewater utilities financial plans. Working with our partners with the finance department, we've developed an updated financial plan based on our operating and capital needs. The plan is a result of our annual review of these expenses and we're not currently asking for additional approvals of our revenues. With this update, the financial plans are constructed to ensure that we are meeting the needs of the public, as water is the cornerstone of public health, economic development and the quality of life in our large city, it is with these principles that we develop the capital and operating plans that are annually reviewed and coordinated with the finance department. The overall mission of the water services department is to provide high quality, reliable, cost effective service that meets the needs of the public and the public needs and builds and maintains on their support. We have all seen the stories of the other utilities across the US where that support and that trust has been broken. The goals of the financial plan are to ensure that the utilities have adequate resources to maintain that established trust through safe, reliable systems, exceeding regulatory requirements and responsibly rehabilitating and maintaining our critical infrastructure. And all of this is done while balancing and maintaining our high bond ratings and our affordability.

And all of this is done while balancing and maintaining our high bond ratings and our affordability. This slide shows the current bond ratings for both the water and wastewater systems and it essentially that we maintain our bond ratings to minimize our financing costs. This is accomplished by ensuring that we have adequate reserves to make debt service payments and strong fiscal management of the utilities. Next, we'll move on and look at the financial plan for the water utility. As I previously stated, annually the department goes through a comprehensive review of the capital and operating programs. The department then with our partners in the finance department, to develop this five year outlook of our revenues. What we are showing here is the historic revenue adjustment. Since 1997 for the water utility. On average, the water revenue adjustment has been around five or 6%. As we discussed in the past, the utilities experienced no increases. It places pressure in a few areas, either in the available fund balance or how much we have in reserve, future revenue increases or in the size of the capital programs that we're trying to implement. This is an overview of our operating expenses for this fiscal year. Our largest expense for the water utility is the cost of our people that has followed up with what we call our big three expenses or raw water, electricity and chemicals. The budget has increased by approximately 12% over the last year due to people and chemical costs, and most of these costs were anticipated in last year's plan and accounted for this graph shows by category how our capital improvement program is spread out. As in all recent capital programs, most of the program is focused on water pipe rehabilitation and replacement, followed closely by the work done at the water treatment plants. In June of last year, as Ginger pointed out, the city council approved the revenue changes for 2024 and 2025. Our current financial plan shows that we are tracking with the previous plan with only a slight change in 2028. With that said, the forecast is uncertain and somewhat presumptive in the out years due to potential uncertain economic impacts. Next, we'll cover the wastewater utilities financial plan with a similar methodology to the water utility. This is the historic wastewater revenue adjustments with an average annual increase of a little over a three 3%. Again, the 0% increases add pressure to the fund, balances the capital programs or future rate increases. This is an overview of our wastewater operating expenses for this fiscal year. Our largest expense for the wastewater utility is the cost of our pit bull, similar to the water utility, and that's followed up by the expenses paid to the water utility. Our wastewater side has seen an increase of approximately 15%, again in personnel and chemicals and accounted for in our previous plans. This graph shows by category the capital program spread out for the wastewater capital. As in all recent capital programs, the wastewater program, most of the wastewater CIP is focused on sewer pipe rehabilitation and replacement, followed by work at the wastewater treatment plan. Those two programs make up almost 90% of the capital improvement program for the wastewater utility, similar to the water side. In June of last year, the city council approved our revenue changes for 2024 and 2025. Our current financial plan shows that we are tracking the previous plan with a slight change in 2028, again noting that the forecasts out in those out years are a little uncertain due to potential economic impacts that we may see. This was provided for information only as we are not requesting for approvals or changes to our revenues at this time. And with that, we are open to any questions that you may have. Thank you. Thank you. And I want to thank councilwoman O'Brien for calling to my attention. This probably should be a discussion item because it's something we need to think about in the future, and talking about rates is really important, important and critical to the taxpayers of Phoenix. So I'm glad you did this. I appreciate it. It's such a great idea. We're going to do it for public works next because they too rely on rates and so they'll be here next month. But again, this is just in the future. We're not setting any rates today but it's important people know about it. With that, are there any questions? I do have a couple, yes. Councilwoman O'Brien, thank you so much. Troy. On the history of both the water revenue adjustments as well as the wastewater revenue adjustments, there you talk about, you mentioned briefly about the zero rate increase, and could you talk a little bit more about that and what that does to the system? Yeah. So if we go back and we can bring the slide up, that shows the water rate increase. So essentially what you have on an average basis on the water side is there is usually somewhere between a five and 6% annual increase of the revenues.

On the history of both the water revenue adjustments as well as the wastewater revenue adjustments, there you talk about, you mentioned briefly about the zero rate increase, and could you talk a little bit more about that and what that does to the system? Yeah. So if we go back and we can bring the slide up, that shows the water rate increase. So essentially what you have on an average basis on the water side is there is usually somewhere between a five and 6% annual increase of the revenues. And so essentially what happens in those years where we have 0%, what you're really putting pressure on is in a couple areas, is either we're intentionally or unintentionally drawing down the fund balance. So the amount that we have in reserve to pay, you know, for bond, our bond or other things, basically how much we have in our savings account to, to able to overcome changes that we have in chemical costs that happen throughout the year and things like that. Or it's putting pressure on the capital program that would be, we would have to artificially deflate or reduce the amount of work that we're doing in an annual, in any given year in order to make sure that the money all works out. Or it potentially could put impacts on future rate increases, making those larger to compensate for the ones that we had, the zero. And on the water slide, what you saw is during the great Recession there, there was a few years that the water services department on the water utility had 0% rate increases. What you see coming out of that in 2019 and 2020 is, is rates that were slightly larger than that 5% average that we saw. And so what you saw is the capital program being shifted to those later years and then those expenses then having to be picked up. One of the things to note is our infrastructure is in the ground and normally lasts somewhere between 50 to 75 years or so. And so the infrastructure doesn't necessarily go away. That rehabilitation of that. Do you want to pay now or do you want to pay later? And we know looking at all of expenses is when you pay later, it does cost more. And on page twelve, which has the wastewater revenue adjustments, there is a significant decrease of 7.5% and looks like 2012. Can you tell me a little bit about that? We can. And so what you see in the early two thousands, a couple of things, you see rather larger rate increases associated with the wastewater utility. Those were mainly due to a couple of things one was we were doing installation of new wastewater treatment plant at 91st Avenue, which we call UPO one and UPO five, which would be the 2001 and 2005 expansions of that facility. And also during that time, the wastewater utility had rates associated with sewer flow mitigation. Basically, we were having a lot of pressure based on development and all that on the sewer impact. Some of the things that happened with the recession is essentially development slowed down and kind of cooled off, which then didn't necessarily materialize. And so there were rates that were accumulated and happened that didn't necessarily materialize in actual projects. And so that's why the department then at that time, decided to put a rate decrease, because the programs in which we were going to implement or we thought we were going to implement didn't actually materialize and thus were then adjusted in the rates. Wonderful. I appreciate that. And then we talk about, or you just mentioned that this infrastructure is in the ground and it does get to last, hopefully 50 to 75 years. And generally speaking, right as our city is developed, those who are developing it are required to pay for that infrastructure and install it. My question is, how do you and your department calculate the maintenance and operation of that additional infrastructure for long term planning? Right in district one, we're getting a whole lot of new infrastructure, and hopefully we'll continue to get it. My concern is, how do we do those calculations to ensure that your budget is appropriate 10, 15, 20 years down the road? Yeah. So essentially, ten or 15 or 20 years down the road is a little difficult. As I said, it's a little challenging for us even to go out five years or so. But what we have is a very robust asset management program that we've implemented where all of our assets are put into a computerized asset management program that's tracking the lifecycle of them. And when we anticipate the rehabilitation or replacement of them, it's also helping us analyze of whether we rehabilitate or replace that infrastructure. But the right period of time to do that, you can do it too early, and that way you're shutting off additional years that you could have gotten out of that infrastructure or do it too late, and then you're exposing yourself to risk of a failure in the meantime. And so essentially, how we do that is through a big, complicated computer program that kind of manages all of our tens of thousands of assets and kind of puts those in conjunction. One of the things, as you brought that up, it may be interesting to come back as a future subcommittee presentation, is a little background on our potentially our pipes and kind of showing how Phoenix kind of grew as a community and what the age of our pipes are and what's coming. A little bit of our concern is you see a lot of our growth on the pipe infrastructure happening in the 1970s and the 1980s. Right. You start to see infrastructure kind of pick up in the fifties and sixties, but really start going in the 1970s and eighties.

And vice mayor, thank you so much for allowing them to come give this presentation. It is so important to me that our constituents understand where we are on an annual basis with this, especially since this involves rates to them directly, and I want them to be able to know what is going on in these departments. So thank you. Thank you, Troy. Thank you, Ginger. Absolutely. And I hope part of that presentation you'll talk about polybutylene. We can. So any other questions? I do advise. Councilwoman. Thank you. Chair. I just wanted to just clarify for us here the financial plan. A five year financial plan on both projections are just that. They're just projections based largely on our current conditions with some adjustments or estimates for growth and depreciation of our assets. And I just wanted to clarify, maybe when this comes back, it may be a better time for this conversation, but I was wondering if there is an ongoing evaluation or if we could evaluate one of the larger expenses on both sides is our contractual services. And I'm wondering if there's any consideration given to possibly bring in those services in house. Maybe that would be a more cost effective way of getting them done. And as well as our big three, specifically our electricity and chemical usage, I'm wondering if there's any way we can at least reassess, is there any way to do this in a more cost effective manner as well? So I know we're based primarily based on current conditions, but I would just encourage as we look forward, as we plan to see if those are areas where we're, we could maybe possibly find some cost savings. If not, I understand as well, but I just wanted to at least flag that for us. All right. Any other questions? Well, thank you again for this presentation. And we'll anxiously await what public works has to share with us next time. Thank you. Our next item is for discussion and a possible action. It's the West Phoenix high capacity Transit Alternatives analysis study. That's a mouthful. Madam chair, Marcus Coleman, our light rail administrator, is here to present, along with Marty Ziek from Valley Metro. Turn it over to you, Marcus. Marty is making his way around the long way. Madam Chair, members of the subcommittee, thank you for having us here today, and we're really excited to be here to present our recommendation. As a result of our West Phoenix alternative analysis study, we're really. This was a year and a half exercise that city of Phoenix partnered with Valley Metro to conduct. And so we have Marty Z. Zeke here, who is with us from Valley Metro project manager, and he will lead the presentation and then give back to me at a later date. At a later point in the presentation. Sorry, not later date. Thank you, Marcus. As Marcus has said, I'm Marty Ziek, the capital planning manager for Valley Metro. Next slide, please. So the map you see in front of you is the regionally approved high capacity transit map in the momentum plan. The West Phoenix high capacity transit alternatives analysis is focusing on a new area, which you see in that red square on the western edge of the map. So that is what we are focusing on mainly in the western portions of Phoenix and Maryvale in particular. As Marcus has said, this project has been going on for about a year and a half. It first received approval to take place through the CTC in August of 2021. It went through this committee in October of that year, and then formal council approved it in November. We received a federal route planning restoration grant in mid 2022, and then had the real project start up in November of that year. As we look to the purpose of the project and what really guided us through this entire effort, the first main thing was that we were looking to enhance local and regional access to major activity centers, both within our study area and into metro Phoenix as a whole. We are seeking to improve transit frequency as well as the quality of what's provided in the West Phoenix area and particularly in Maryvale. We're looking to increase the network capacity, and that's by improving mobility and then providing new modes of transportation to a region that right now is mainly served by local bus service. And then finally, we wanted to ensure that our study was focusing on enhancing the mobility of folks who rely on the public transportation network as their main means of getting around, which in the industry we call transit, reliant populations start out with the public outreach that we did as a part of the effort. I won't read through everything on this slide, but we did a significant amount of outreach, really trying", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "A little bit of our concern is you see a lot of our growth on the pipe infrastructure happening in the 1970s and the 1980s.

And then finally, we wanted to ensure that our study was focusing on enhancing the mobility of folks who rely on the public transportation network as their main means of getting around, which in the industry we call transit, reliant populations start out with the public outreach that we did as a part of the effort. I won't read through everything on this slide, but we did a significant amount of outreach, really trying to target all of the different areas within the study area that we were studying that we were looking into. This process took place over the course of the entire project. So about a year and a half over that time, we held 15 public meetings starting in March of 2023, and the last ones wrapped up in March of this year. Ten of those meetings were in person, five were virtual. Over the course of those 15 meetings, we had 426 attendees and received over 900 comments back from the public. Our first series of outreach introduced the study. We then went through what we call the tier one evaluation, which I'll present in a few slides. In September and October of last year, we went to the public with our recommended transit type as well as our route. And then finally in early 2024, we went out with all of the rest of the high capacity transit extensions that are proposed and planned in the western portions of Phoenix for what we call the future Phoenix high capacity transit outreach. And then we followed that up with the presentation of what we're bringing to the subcommittee today, our locally preferred alternative in February and march of this year. The main themes that we received from the public during this outreach is that, based on the transit type, they wanted something that was fast and reliable. They wanted service that was accessible, could get them to where they needed to go. There was the desire to have something that could really carry a high volume of folks just based on the existing transit ridership that we see in the western portions of Phoenix. The public was also very interested in the impacts of construction for doing high capacity transit project, as well as ensuring that the project provided a service that focused on safety as well as security. In terms of the route, the main focuses were ensuring that we had strong access to activity centers, as well as providing access to that core of the Maryvale village, ensuring that we were solving for time and cost savings for folks that are looking to go to downtown Phoenix for both work as well as special events, providing what we call a straighter route for more efficiency. And that's essentially looking at how can we get people quickly from the western portions of the city to that central Avenue corridor. And then finally the last couple pieces, there was a desire from the public for us to look at ways to reduce traffic congestion on indian school through providing an additional mode and then providing greater access to businesses along the corridor and in the western portion of the city in general, to go through the project and essentially the different stages that were presented to the public. We started out by identifying a study area. The eastern end of the study area was Central Avenue, the northern end of the study area, Camelback Road, the western end of the study area, 99th Avenue. So right west of of the Loop 101, and then the southern boundary of the study area was McDowell Road. A couple things I'll point out quick before moving on. All of our recommendations and everything that we advanced through this process, we wanted to ensure that they connected into three key transit investments, the first being the existing light rail system providing a good transfer point, and that's shown on the map in the purple line with the station locations in white circles. We also wanted to ensure that every option we examined had a connection to the Phoenix bus rapid transit project, which is shown in Blue along 35th Avenue. And then finally, that all of the options also provided a transfer point to the I ten west light rail extension, which is shown on the lower portion of the map in the red hatched line. Initially, we identified ten route options that were brought to the public. As you can see on this map, the main key of doing this exercise was ensuring that we identified activity centers and large concentrations of population throughout the study area and ensuring that we were identifying all of the different potentials as to where folks could potentially be using the service, and then going from there to see what maybe made the most sense in terms of the criteria that we used in this two tier evaluation process. Community input has been paramount throughout the process from beginning to end. We also looked into community characteristics. Essentially, is an area with its land use something that would make sense for high capacity transit, or are we looking at areas that maybe are less dense and have land uses that might not necessarily bring people towards transit.

Community input has been paramount throughout the process from beginning to end. We also looked into community characteristics. Essentially, is an area with its land use something that would make sense for high capacity transit, or are we looking at areas that maybe are less dense and have land uses that might not necessarily bring people towards transit. We looked into physical and engineering constraints to ensure that even at this early stage in the project, we were not identifying and advancing corridors that, just based on whatever constraints may exist, could not get built and furthered along. We did do very preliminary cost estimates to ensure that the project was making sense financially. We looked at ridership potential, because, of course, when you're looking at high capacity transit, providing that biggest benefit to the most number of potential riders is always a strong component. And then finally the last two pieces, we looked at the existing land use as well as the economic development potential along all of these corridors to ensure that where we're researching high capacity transit is in an area that people will be continuing to flock to into the future, and then finally, ensuring that this project would be compatible with the existing transportation network. Both public transit and roads, as well as any planned investments to ensure that we're connecting into all of the different investments that are going to be taking place in the western portion of Phoenix, and also not duplicating or building redundancy into any of those efforts. What that brought us to is what we call our tier two evaluation, where we looked very, very deeply at two alternatives and then also identified the mode of transit that we will. That we are recommending the subcommittee move ahead with today both of these options on the eastern end of the corridor. So that's where you see that purple Line on Central Avenue connected with the existing light rail system at Central Avenue and Indian School, headed west from there to provide a transfer point to the 35th Avenue bus rapid transit line at 35th Avenue, an indian school, and then continued into kind of that core of the Merivale village at 51st Avenue and Indian School. Two lines diverged at that point, with the Green Line continuing west along Indian School Road to serve some high density residential corridors west of 67th Avenue, and then the red Line continued south on 51st Avenue to Thomas and west along Thomas to serve a lot of those commercial corridors that are in that section of Maryvale on Thomas. Both of these options then end at 79th Avenue in Thomas, the Desert Sky Transit center, to provide that connection to the I ten west corridor. And we did identify a potential option to continue the project further west a mile and a half to 91st Avenue in Thomas, where it would have the potential to serve a growing medical district that's anchored by a banner hospital. At this point, we also identified between bus rapid transit and light rail as the transit type. And based on the ridership projections, as well as a number of different factors, light rail rose to the top as what we recommend for this project. So, that being the case, our recommendation that we brought to the public was a light rail transit option from Central Avenue west on Indian School Road to 75th Avenue, south on 75th, and then from there west along Thomas Road. At this point, we brought this recommendation out to the public and received some comments saying that there was the interest for us to review these tier two results, to essentially analyze that eastern end of the corridor where we had shown it initially, starting out at Central Avenue in Indian School, the public had floated an additional option to start the project out at the light rail transit station at 19th Avenue in Camelback, continuing south along 19th Avenue to Indian School, and then continuing. What was that green alternative? West. From there, we did this analysis. We saw merit in both options, and we brought it back to the public and got essentially some interest in both of those two options. So, that being the case, and given the preliminary nature of this project, we bring forward for potential consideration the map that you see here on the screen where we're identifying both options on that eastern end of the alignment, either Central Avenue and Indian School or 19th Avenue in Camelback, when those two would get to 19th Avenue and Indian School. Our recommendation then continues west, as discussed before. At this point, I will turn the presentation over to Marcus. Thank you, Marty. So I would like to take a moment to talk about the funding needs from a historical standpoint of providing light rail service into the West Valley. Back in March of 2019, council at that time took action to delay the then camelback 43rd avenue alignment to the end of the t 2050 program. Those were future funds that would have come to that project, as that project was slated to start seeing expenditures in FY of 2024. And can I just kind of interrupt in there? I think part of the reason that the city council kind of did a shift was there were a lot of factors going on along Camelback Road. I hope my memory is correct on this. First, Grand Canyon University was going through some massive changes on their campus, and they had some concerns with the route, but also Glendale pulled out of the route. They actually, there was a discussion back in the day about it going all the way out to the Cardinals stadium, and that kind of went by the wayside.

So I think from a council perspective, because I was on the council at the time, I think we felt like we needed to redirect, reshift some of our priorities. So just kind of a background, am I right? And I think those were the two main factors. Madam chair, members of the subcommittee. Yes, you are correct that during that time, there are some outside factors that the council had to take into consideration, as well, as it was a citizens petition that actually initiated that conversation for the council to take action on. Thank you. No problem. And so as part of that action to delay the project to the end of the program, council also directed that those future funds for the project be redirected to the street transportation department for street maintenance. Those funds, however, because they were future funds, have not been moved out of the transit side of the T 2050 program to the street transportation side of the program. However, we know that that is still a council action, and so we'll discuss that as part of this recommendation as well. So the restoration of those funds to the T 2050 plan for the transit side of it is part of our recommendation today, as we are looking to bring this recommendation to bring light rail service back to the West Phoenix area, specifically serving the Maryville corridor. Bringing that line back into our program would essentially be annoying transit service to the West Phoenix community that would have potentially been serviced by the Camelback 43rd Avenue alignment that was initially delayed. And also, another factor of our program is the removal of the rental sales tax has had an impact on our T 2050 program. We have to continue to monitor our program. Knowing that we have approximately 26 years left in our program, it's going to be very critical that we continue to keep an eye on our program as we look to things such as the capital cost for projects, operation, operational costs for our system as well, and then things that we don't necessarily have direct control over, the performance of the sales tax and how those sales tax will perform over the next years, and then also federal participation, their level of funding for these projects. We've seen with different administrations that we've seen that fluctuate in between anywhere from seven to 10% in fluctuation. And so we have to make sure that we monitor that over the course of the remainder of the 26 years of this program. The next steps after today for this recommendation will go to our formal council for consideration. If approved there, it will go to Valley Metro Rail Board for approval consideration, and then finally to our MAG, through a Mag process, through Maricopa association of Governments, to modify the regional transportation plan. As we look to the timing of this project, we have right now planned, if approved through full council, that we would see initial expenditures in the year of 2026. This would be very 2036. Sorry. This would be to handle things such as preliminary engineering and really starting to reengage with the community as this project would be closer to implementation with construction starting in around that 2039 2040 year timeframe. I just. Vice mayor. So this project would start in the 2039 2040 timeframe, construction. Construction? Yes. That would be when we first moved dirt. Yes, you are correct. And so that brings us to the recommendation. The recommendation from staff is that staff recommends that the city council approve approval of the proposed route for light rail as the transit mode for the West Phoenix high capacity transit, locally preferred alternatives. In addition, the restoration of t 2050 funds previously redirected out of the transit program. Do we have any questions? I do. I just have one clarifying question. You indicated that the preliminary engineering would start around 2037. For. If this is. If we proceed as planned as recommended. I'm sorry. And would it be around that same timeframe? We would make a determination as to which one of the alternatives would. And I say alternative, I'm talking about indian school and 19. Sorry, camelback and 19 Ave. Or indian school at Central. Is that around the timeframe the decision would be made, or would it be taken out to the community earlier than the 2036 timeframe? Madam chair, members of the subcommittee, you are correct. That is when that decision would be made. There would be an extensive engagement process with the community not only to make that determination, but other facets of the project as well, station locations, operational procedures, and things of that nature. And is it safe to say, you presume, that this delayed decision point won't further delay the implementation of the light rail in this area? Madam chair, members of the subcommittee. Yes. We feel that by having both options, not only does it allow for the community to be able to react to this as we get closer to the implementation, but it also helps us to guide development that is looking to propose on either one of those corridors.

And so the development can be geared towards a transit orientated development, as well as we'll have the opportunity to connect with the community to make sure that the final decision is a decision that they can stand behind without having any impact to the delay of the project itself. Thank you. Thank you, chair. Are there any other questions? Yes, Councilwoman O'Brien, I would like to talk about the $153 million restoration back to this. And so you said those are future dollars. So are they so future like the 2039 timeframe that you're talking about? I'm trying to understand how this will impact streets. So, Madam chair, members of the subcommittee, unfortunate for us when council took that action a year and a half ago for us to start looking back into and conducting the public engagement process for this analysis study, that funding that when we say future funding, that funding wouldn't have been available for this project until this FY, because we got that action from council to look into this study, that funding was not programmed into streets and it was not programmed to be utilized, and so that we would need to have council action take place to restore those funds back into the transit system, but from a street transportation standpoint, they are left whole because they did not program those funds into any of their programming for the FY. Okay. That is helpful. And then you talked about on slide, I think, 18, that the removal of the residential sales tax. And can you quantify the loss there? Madam Chair, members of the subcommittee for the removal of the rental sales tax. Right now, we're looking at approximately $26 million impact to the actual transit t 2050 program per year. And then we extrapolate that out over to the end of the program, we're looking at approximately 836 million. I think it was roughly 836 million, $836 million loss to the t 2050 due to the loss of residential rental sales tax because of actions by the state legislature. Thank you. I appreciate that clarification. Those are all my questions. Madam Chair. Thank you. Any other questions? And just also going back to 2019, this is all coming back to me. I also believe we had car dealerships that also had concerns with that that had come down and voiced opposition as well. And then at the same time, we were getting pounded about the condition of our roads. And so I think the council felt like we really had to redirect. So. But I am supportive of this motion. So do we have a motion? I move to approve as recommended by city staff. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any nays? It passes unanimously. Thank you. Thank you. We have called to public. The first is Eric Nielsen. Hello. My name's Eric. I came today because I've spoken to you before about my friend who experienced a mental health emergency and died in a heat related incident on the side of the road. And I think a lot about him, especially this time of year. And I've been thinking all winter, ever since it happened two years ago, I've been thinking about how to possibly remedy this situation. The city can't really afford to put a drinking fountain in every corner. That's not realistic. But what the city could afford to do is on the buses where they have the trash cans. Little trash cans right by the far reader. I don't see why we couldn't also install a little, like, top opening mini fridge and put cold water in there, because I've seen several fentanyl addicts oding on the side of the road, and the bus driver is not an ambulance. He can't do anything about it. He can't even let them on the bus to cool off. So why not be able to toss them a bottle of water? And also for the people who get on the bus after waiting, sometimes up to half an hour to an hour, if the bus happens to break down or something, I just think it'd be a great idea for our heat mitigation efforts to put little mini fridges connected to the bus power and just give out some cold water. Kind of like the heat relief centers for riders and people like that. And there was one more thing I wanted to add, but it's slipping my mind. All right, well, thank you for your time.

And yet, you know, none of this $700,000, and we're sure it's coming out of three PI funds, has not been broached at any of these committees. None of the rangers or personnel down there know what is going on. And they're not. They haven't addressed the water lines, and they've been failing for a decade. And they're, you know, they go back 60 years, and if they, you know, if they put in all these new electrical systems, pumps, and they don't address the water lines, I don't want to see another dime spent down there on this renovation. It's a complete waste of money. And we want some accountability here. You know, if they're not broaching this to the public, you know, we have other recourses and we'll go to them and we'll get some answers. But, I mean, this is ridiculous. The centennial project should be new infrastructure. Quit worrying about this other stuff, you know, fluff. Take care of the infrastructure. That's what we did at PI Estua Peak, put it in a whole new water line so there'd be no issues down the line. And that's what we expect from. And, you know, I have to tell you, after your last meeting last month, within 24 hours, the parks board canceled their meeting on their own whim. It's a public meeting. It's not for them to arbitrarily cancel because they don't want to hear the truth. Thank you. Thank you. And our last speaker is Diane Barker. Thank you. Chairwoman Stark and subcommittee got it right. Diane Barker in District seven. And I just want to remind the city is that I think that it's really good to have people such as Jerry and, you know, others that have been around that have institutional memory, you know, and yay for our seniors. Vice mayor, you've pointed that before. I got to meet with my councilman. What a fine gentleman, and he's happy about our water program. Some successes. And the one at Burton bar, they actually had some people that did come for the respite. I was over there, I got some water and it's just the start. I think that's going to be a successful program for that. The other thing is that if I was told by a man in real estate one time, he says, if we don't watch out where we're going going, we could end up there. And in regards to what Jerry brings up and what I'm talking about is this flyer and has to do with high capacity rail transit, reinventing Phoenix. And in 2013, they're talking about all these quarters. Well, let me just remind you that one reason why we have the light rail we have, which has gone from 70 million mile to 245. And most of the monies that are coming in, as mag shows for the rail are going for the rehabilitation and operations. We've gotten to that point. So what I'm wanting you to do is really to look at. Phoenix is a long time in transit. I favor transit. You're talking about the benefits on this transit orientated community. It's the same thing in regards to flexible bus. The passengers that used transit every quarter of a mile had a bus stop. We started with this transit oriented because guess what? Valtrans didn't pass in 1988. So the engineers scurried around a longtime engineer, James Moore's from California here. BRW started with the federal government earmarked into the city for transit orientated development. They were called mis major investment. Jack Tevlin was here and I was here in 2000. They say Phoenix airport is fully funded by itself. It got 27,000 from the federal highway in through there. 10,000 went to RPTA. And we keep going on with this transitory. I ask you to look at the accidents. We have accidents. We had woman killed from the light rail. We hear about it, then nothing. This is expensive. The cars don't have the insurance money to carry for this accident. And it's left hand turns. The cars were there before the transitory. I'm going to see what the public is going to say about this. Thank you. We have no other speakers. I think we have a fairly full agenda for June and so with that, I adjourn people experiencing homelessness in a more healthy, sustainable way. Essentially, we're trying to dissuade people from giving and feeding on the street and encourage them to partner with a nonprofit organization to maximize their good hearted efforts.", "esg_v1": [{"name": "South Mountain Park", "insights": [{"observation": "The infrastructure at South Mountain Park is collapsing, including water infrastructure, despite $700,000 being spent on new electrical systems and pumps.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "None of the park\u2019s personnel or rangers know what is going on with the infrastructure renovation plans.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Water lines have been failing for decades and are 60 years old but are not being addressed.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Calls for accountability and transparency in the renovation project.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Burton Bar", "insights": [{"observation": "Successful implementation of water programs and respite services.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Phoenix Rail Transit", "insights": [{"observation": "Phoenix rail projects have increased significantly in cost, from $70 million per mile to $245 million per mile.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Most of the funds are for rehabilitation and operations of the rail system.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Concerns about accidents involving the light rail, including fatalities and insufficient insurance to cover accidents.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "Encouraging people to partner with nonprofit organizations to help the homeless in a more healthy and sustainable way.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "South Mountain Park", "insights": [{"observation": "The infrastructure at South Mountain Park is collapsing, including water infrastructure, despite $700,000 being spent on new electrical systems and pumps.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "None of the park\u2019s personnel or rangers know what is going on with the infrastructure renovation plans.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Water lines have been failing for decades and are 60 years old but are not being addressed.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Calls for accountability and transparency in the renovation project.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Burton Bar", "insights": [{"observation": "Successful implementation of water programs and respite services.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Phoenix Rail Transit", "insights": [{"observation": "Phoenix rail projects have increased significantly in cost, from $70 million per mile to $245 million per mile.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Most of the funds are for rehabilitation and operations of the rail system.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Concerns about accidents involving the light rail, including fatalities and insufficient insurance to cover accidents.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "City of Phoenix", "insights": [{"observation": "Encouraging people to partner with nonprofit organizations to help the homeless in a more healthy and sustainable way.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 4390328, "chunk_end_time": 4841344, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDIdQi8sSBU", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDIdQi8sSBU&t=4390s"}], "date": "15/05/2024", "meeting_name": "Transportation Infrastructure and Planning Subcommittee Meeting"}]}
