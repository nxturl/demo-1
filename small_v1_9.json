Jack, I had a quick question I should have asked in the study session. Would it benefit when we place this hope? Hopefully when we place this order, would it benefit those other businesses or those businesses to maybe piggyback off this order if they did want something else? Do you see what I'm saying? Because I know you said you could make it modifications or additions or something to this. So, yes, we're buying the standard base, but if Theo's Java hut wanted to do something extra, would you suggest that they piggyback on this? Would it save some costs rather than. You see where I'm going with that? Yes. Test? Test, yes. Sorry, I should have asked that earlier. No, great question. And that will be part of the strategy. So if it is approved, we will essentially take a menu of additional features or add ons to those business owners that will be receiving the seasonal patio fencing, with the option of them investing some additional funds to further customize, like loonies was not included on this. So go to Mister Rusk and say, hey, would you like to piggyback with that? Okay. Yes. Awesome. Thank you. And also, kind of the idea with that one specifically was in a location in front of both of those areas where they could service both of the restaurants. Thank you. Thank you. Roll call, please.

I noticed conspicuously that an intergovernmental agreement for a strategic housing plan is not included in this list. I know we had talked about potentially group buying with our neighboring communities for a strategic housing plan in addition to the housing needs assessment and analysis of impediments to fair housing. Where does that conversation stand with respect to our neighbors doing a strategic housing plan and us doing one? I guess. Sure. Good question. So there's two parts to the answer. One is time and one is money time. First, these need to be done further along where the data has actually been collected before. We need to start that strategic housing plan. The idea being that CDBG funds will pay for the data collection and then we can come back with ARPA funds to pay for the actual strategic housing development plan. That brings us to the money part.

Second, move to second. Any discussion? Yes. Is there a way that we can get, or we can have included into the plan the alleys? Either. I know we're doing maintenance on them now, but a way to eventually remove the gravel and go with the asphalt or something? Yeah, we can. If the council would like to include that. The first initial five year plan obviously focuses on the residential streets. There's a. There's a, you know, important need to get to those streets first. But again, we can. We can add anything that the council so chooses. So that's really up to the council at this point. I just know what the verbiage is. Not in there. It's going to get lost in this office. Well, it is in the. In the plan, and I believe it's mentioned in the ordinance as far as Allie's goes, so it can be included in the work. Okay. And, yes, I just, I mean, I will vote for this, but I just have a concern and would like us to look at those properties that have ravines that are considered very large, that they're getting assessed a large amount of money. And I guess I just, I would like us to look at, is there a way that we can, I don't know, provide an exemption and remove the square footage of the ravines? I've just had calls from people who have lots with ravines and trees that are going to be assessed a larger amount of money than other people, and they're just kind of being penalized because they have a living that rents do their lives. So I would just like to. I would go, sorry. Does that help? Yeah, yeah. Thank you. I would concur with her thoughts, because if you're not using the property, mean, you, you certainly, you knew it was there, but I would venture guess that you probably didn't realize that it was going to affect you in this manner, but affect you in property tax because your value is higher, you know, because you got a larger piece of land. And so you get, property taxes are assessed based on that. And they knew that, you know, they get to enjoy the wilderness or whatever in some cases. And so, you know, it's a slippery slope. You go down because all of a sudden someone else says, well, I'm not using this parking lot anymore.

You go down because all of a sudden someone else says, well, I'm not using this parking lot anymore. So, you know, when you talk about not using it, that's a slippery slope. You go down. What is used and what isn't used and can define the. What's used. Used for beauty, used for recreational used. You know, so businesses, you know what? So I get a little concerned about that. I'd have to defer to the city attorney. But since this is a first reading and having to make or look at those revisions, we wouldn't have that assessment done before this second reading would come back. So I don't know what would be the proper order. Right. What would happen is a council member would have to make a motion to amend the ordinance and provide the language that they would like to amend the ordinance. And so that would be a part of the approval at the next hearing. They can always amend it when it comes for passage, but then it would have to rewrite the language. One clarification. So you meant ravines. Right. But that's very wide ranging. You know, you could throw in the mix of even an empty lot. I know you didn't mention that, but the same really is for an empty lot, too. They have the same concern. So how we would. There's a lot of analysis that we would have to look at into excluding those properties. Right. We did. I mean, that was talked about in our discussions and consideration. But at the end of the day, they are. They do have a parcel of the city, and they are utilizing the streets to get to that empty lot. I'll say. So that was the reason that we included them. And procedurally, what we could do is, if you wanted to make the motion to amend the ordinance at the next reading, with the stipulation that we would redraft the language and bring it back forward to council, we are able to do that procedurally. We would just want to make sure that we work with city staff so that it passes and it's constitutional and all that. Of course, you start losing revenue, too. Yeah. And that'd be part of the analysis. We're not sure, and, I mean, I look over to Luke and see, but we haven't run the numbers on what that impact would be. We're obviously have base this around a model that will support what's the funding that's needed for the improvements, which is around $2 million. But again, that would certainly have an impact on the revenue. Go ahead. One of the. There you go. Okay, everybody. One of the challenges with the ravine scenario is if that ravine is on the same parcel logistically. So, like, say, like, I have my. My lawn, and then it. It goes to the ravine. Logistically, how would you calculate what type of reduction that would. That would be? So really, if you. If you move away from. If you start making certain parcels exempt or unexempt or you start modifying that, you're really just looking at a property tax at that point would probably be a more efficient model. So that was one of the incentives of going with the parcels is one it gets. Even though I have. I'm just gonna not use that. Can everybody hear me? Yes. That was one of our. As Mike kind of said, one of our incentives. We're going with the parcels is it allows for a billing structure. And one of the other benefits is those spaces that are being underutilized are actively contributing to this fund. And so that's kind of a silver lining as well, is that you are, in fact, generating revenue off of unproductive land. So, obviously, it's all the council's prerogative. But to kind of Mike's point, if you one, you'd lose a significant amount of revenue. And then two, you'd really have to. You'd be upending your entire model. If that makes sense. Because that ravine may not necessarily be a separate parcel. If that makes sense, it'd be difficult to administer. How would you define a ravine? How would you verify whether the people had ravines or not? It'd be. Make it much more challenging. Yeah, well. Well said. That's why Todd gets paid the big bucks.

I believe we did. We have a motion and a second on for. We have to take a roll call. Okay, we already have that. I'd also like to ask a question. Yes, Miles. First off, greatly appreciate the executive summary. At the beginning of this caper. That is a big improvement and way easier to digest. This report. Specifically, I had a question about the admission that we failed to generate. I believe it was four jobs. The economic development goals of this past year. Can you speak on that? Why were we unsuccessful? So that is directly related to the status of the Kerliff program. Having not issued any loans. So that number is derived from jobs that would be created by an employer receiving a Curliff loan. We recently had a bit of an all hands meeting with Mister Flaherty here, as well as Miss Sager over there. Talking about how our curliffe program perhaps could be improved. Or perhaps how we need to consider different CDBG economic development tools. I know that you have brought that up multiple times. Alderman Parker. Is something that you would like for us to explore further? Actually, myself, the community development manager, as well as Tara Sipes, the economic development manager. Will be up in Dubuque the next three days at a CDBG underwriting training. To hopefully, of course, become just better skilled at CDBG matters. But also talk to some of our peers about some of the things they might be doing in the near future. We'll also be meeting with some of our peers here at home. So Davenport specifically, and kind of picking their brains about maybe some additional things we could be doing. We finally reached a place, especially with Tom here on board, where we think that we can move forward with enacting some change. And we're at a place where we can really begin to consider some alternatives or better practices. So that really is the core of what that number you identify is all about. Thank you very much. Looking forward to the changes. And we do have some applications in the pipeline, correct, for the fund. We do. So, hopefully, we will be issuing some loans here soon. The curliff committee has also made some recommendations about changes which will eventually here move before council. So there's a number of different things in the mix here we're trying to do. If there's a way to make Curlif work, we want to, of course, do that. If there's something different than Curlif or in addition to Kerliff, we should be doing. We also want to fully explore that, too. Okay? Rafer, roll call.

They're not doing rentals at the, at this time. So they have worked that out of how they're going to authorize that. We just felt it would be safer for kids doing an Easter headcan to have that street portion of the street blocked off. Great deal. Are you gonna be dressed as east? I am not.

Okay, item 17, other business. I just want to give a shout out to the dynamic status gyms, their major Ed team here in Rock island. They traveled down to Memphis, Tennessee for dance competition. They actually took second overall. If you are familiar with the dance world, they came second under the dancing dolls, which is a worldwide named group. The group is outstanding. So for our girls to get second behind them, they did an excellent job. They came back with six trophies from six different categories. Great. That's wonderful. I'm going to do a little shout out, a couple shout outs. But one shout out is some of you may have noticed, of course, the presence of Rock island police officers patrolling downtown Rock island. But once again, I'd like to thank Rock island downtown Alliance for their partnership. Jack, I guess, is gone, but for the partnership, as we work together to increase the safety and safety and the sense of community, especially as we prepare the construction project down there. Thank you for the police department cooperation with the alliance. Also, big shout out to one of the, our council members, Jenny Swanson. I'd like to congratulate Alderwoman Jenny Swanson on her selection. A woman of influence by the Quad City Regional Business Journal, Alderman Swanson was only one of ten women chosen in the Quad City regional area from more than 40 nominees for her impact on the community. The Women of Influence award will take place on Thursday, May 23 at the Quad City Waterfront Convention center in Bettendorf. From 530 to eight. So congratulations very much. Well deserved. Anybody? Yes. I think we did a lot of good for the city tonight. There's a lot of meat and this agenda and thank you guys all for this to move the city forward. The downtown, the streets and city hall all in one. It's a lot of money spent, but a lot of hope for the city of Rock island. So. Yep. Thank you, guys. Very well said. It is very well said. And that's what the ARpA money was for. A lot of it's ArpA money. So that was to do things that we normally wouldn't be able to do in an average year for the city of Rock island.

Do you all want to stand up real quick? I know you don't like me doing that to you, but you're all here, so thank you. And then I want to introduce or let recognize board members who are here. You guys go ahead, have a seat. Come on, stand on up, board members. And then we do have representation from our work groups. Mister Van Langen, Tara Miles, all have worked diligently for quite some time over the last year to create this plan for West End revitalization. I do want to introduce very quickly members of the backbone team for this work, and that's myself, Miss Rebecca Arnold, and brand new to our team who was on the steering committee is Mister Avery Pearl. Joining our team. Mister Thurgood Brooks couldn't join us today, he had a previous engagement. But right now we are four strong with our backbone team for the Martin Luther King center. So why don't we go ahead and get started. But before we get too far into talking about the three year general overview of the three year plan, there are some things that are truly vital to know about western revitalization. Some of them you know already. I mean, one great example is that you know that this was truly a participatory process. It was inclusive and included quite a bit of vetting and planning to make sure the work that's going to be done fits our community. It's been over a year in the making, but even more so than that, we've had so many folks involved, including our working groups, including our steering committee. But before that task force to create our steering committee, community conveners to create and implement our assessment within the community has been truly a community involved process which I know this council truly appreciates and has true value for considering the work that you put in to determining how the ARPA dollars are being spent. So we're really aligned in that regard. As far as process, as far as philosophy of being inclusive in our community, the plan, besides having true and authentic community engagement, as I just mentioned, is built on a solid foundation of data as well. We were able to engage enterprise. Community Partners was able to provide us quite a bit of data to power our assessment and to create our recommendations or at least inform our recommendations. There's evidence and there's best practices to show that this type of work using the collective impact model is truly effective. For issues that want to engage the community on broad, challenging issues within the community, it is vital to know that this work is supportive again of collaboration transparency. And really what's important for us is trust. Because as you remember in that survey or in that assessment of the issues that we're seeing within the west end, one of the biggest issues that this community expressed was trust. We have said this over and over and over again, and nothing, that nothing's happened, at least nothing that we can feel and understand. And that's how trust can be interpreted. So what's going to be embedded, as you see moving forward, is that trust is a huge value for this work. This work is going to be long term and it's holistic. We have a three year plan, yes, with a five year vision, but that's just the beginning. This is a process that should be embedded and part of the community work moving forward. It addresses symptoms as well as the root causes, the what and the why it's happening. It's equity and inclusion in action, as you all can see. And most importantly for this context, it's going to strengthen the well being of Rock island. The work is moving towards a vision of the west end being a preferred place to live and. And to thrive. The goal towards that vision is to build the west end's wealth, its power, its livability and the values that are embedded in the work. The how we do this is based in justice, equity, collaboration, empowerment, respect, inclusion, communication. And again, as I emphasize, trust. So let's get into the plan just a little bit. A reminder that this plan is going to focus on five key areas. And while we have separated them out, it's very important to know that none of these are by themselves in a silo. These are intertwined, interwoven. It is a holistic point of view. And the simple reason is this, none of our citizens live in a silo. One aspect always touches the other. And so while we'll talk about these separately, understand that some of the strategies are going to be have a Venn diagram to intersect with the other impact areas. So the plan will be addressing economic vitality, our ability to see support and growth and attract businesses and entrepreneurs within the west end. Assets and income. It's vital increase to wealth and reduced poverty rates in the west end. Infrastructure and visual appeal. A beautiful community in which to live in and to have pride in that is both functional as well.

It's vital increase to wealth and reduced poverty rates in the west end. Infrastructure and visual appeal. A beautiful community in which to live in and to have pride in that is both functional as well. Community engagement, you might hear me refer to it as civic capital. We're enhancing the relationships, the networks, the skills that the communities come together to make decisions, to influence decisions, and then housing and land, safe, stable housing and neighborhoods that are supportive of upward mobility. And not surprising to you, this concretely aligns with some of the work that this council once done within the city of Rock island. So jumping into the plan, any area strengthening civic capital or community engagement in the west end and beyond. Two points, two large overview points. We want to establish platforms and metrics to effectively elevate west end community voices. When in communications, you're going to start hearing terms like accessibility, because these are wonderful words, but what do they really mean? What it really means is there is a community, as you well know, that wants to be engaged in some of the processes that have real impact on their lives. It happens here, it happens in school, it happens in other areas. We're going to create platforms, accessibility ways for community members to be involved in those processes and others as well. Another great example, but a major point with this is creating participatory budgeting processes to reflect the community priorities. We all well know that if we want to best reflect, if we want to know what best reflects our priorities, it's the budget. And so providing opportunities for our citizens, for the West End citizens in particular, to be involved in these processes as they stand, not necessarily to change or revolutionize, but to make sure it's accessible as well as other processes as well, is going to be some of the work in civic capital for the West End building, West End residents assets and income. How are we going to go about that in the plan? Well, three bullet points supporting a service core model as part of a broader workforce development. Things like, let's oversimplify. What if there was a service corps of youth that were able to mow lawns within a West end for free to those residents, but also are gaining a certain skill set that might give them an internship at park and rec or at public works, which in turn provides them with different skill sets that makes them employable in other industries? A true oversimplification, but you understand the example and how you can extrapolate that to scale in other areas. Provide financial services and banking products as an entry point for financial stability, to create wealth and maintain wealth generation for generation? Really? Simply said, we do recognize that in the west end, there are few financial institutions within the west end and thus few financial opportunities, or at least to interact with these institutions. And that's a vital aspect of being financially stable and healthy. And then last, for this plan, looking at funding and incentivizing education savings accounts for our children so that they have a path after they graduate from high school, be it trades, be it college, be it whatever, but making sure that we're incentivizing that funding so that there is upward mobility for the youth that are coming out, increasing housing stability and quality along with community control of land and housing. Four points to take up on this going to support the expansion of proactive rental inspection programs. Well, protecting tenant rights within this area instead of just waiting for things to happen. What if there was a cadre of citizens or other employees or other people involved in making sure that we have strong in compliance housing opportunities for rental for rental people who want to rent property, creating a and or supporting a tenants association, expanding housing supply for potential west end homeowners and then establishing a West End housing rehab support program. Now, I recognize that these are broad areas and I could go into detail if I had the plan in front of me, but we posted this over 100 page plan that has detail by detail, even a timeline on the website to really get into and to really dig into. And we do have some of the folks here to help create that plan to give you some of the ideas or some of the concepts that are going to be involved in these steps. Again, this is an overview of what they're seeking to accomplish within the next three years. How do we increase economic vitality within the West End? Three points. Adopt a community navigator model to support the west end businesses and entrepreneurs. A person, a place, a contact point that can help bring a business, a business plan and idea to life within the West End. Also to prepare businesses to earn contracting opportunities. There's a lot of work in making sure you're eligible for some of the business contracts that are out there. And having another access point to be ready for that would be vital for this area of Rock island. And then one thing that really hits home for many of us, and certainly within the West End, to explore t", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Rock Island", "insights": [{"observation": "We want to establish platforms and metrics to effectively elevate west end community voices.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Creating participatory budgeting processes to reflect the community priorities.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Supporting a service core model as part of a broader workforce development.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Provide financial services and banking products as an entry point for financial stability.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Funding and incentivizing education savings accounts for our children for upward mobility.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Supporting the expansion of proactive rental inspection programs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Protecting tenant rights within this area.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Creating a and/or supporting a tenants association.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Expanding housing supply for potential west end homeowners.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Establishing a West End housing rehab support program.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Adopt a community navigator model to support the West End businesses and entrepreneurs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Prepare businesses to earn contracting opportunities.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City of Rock Island", "insights": [{"observation": "We want to establish platforms and metrics to effectively elevate west end community voices.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Creating participatory budgeting processes to reflect the community priorities.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Supporting a service core model as part of a broader workforce development.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Provide financial services and banking products as an entry point for financial stability.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Funding and incentivizing education savings accounts for our children for upward mobility.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Supporting the expansion of proactive rental inspection programs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Protecting tenant rights within this area.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Creating a and/or supporting a tenants association.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Expanding housing supply for potential west end homeowners.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Establishing a West End housing rehab support program.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Adopt a community navigator model to support the West End businesses and entrepreneurs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Prepare businesses to earn contracting opportunities.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 261354, "chunk_end_time": 655190, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDv2Nkdb6WQ", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDv2Nkdb6WQ&t=261s"}, {"start": 9000, "end": 15000, "text": "tail by detail, even a timeline on the website to really get into and to really dig into.

There's a lot of work in making sure you're eligible for some of the business contracts that are out there. And having another access point to be ready for that would be vital for this area of Rock island. And then one thing that really hits home for many of us, and certainly within the West End, to explore the creation of a community grocery store in the west End. It is without question that this council and our mayor has worked diligently to create a grocery store within this area of Rock island. Citizens within the west End are going to be aligned with this work, to help with this work, to make sure they have a grocery store that we can get true food and nutrition within the area. Improving the West End's infrastructure and visual design. So exploring and supporting partnerships to redevelop Franklin Field, an issue that has long been a concern for the west end of Rock island. And so it's not necessarily that this plan is going to take over that redevelopment, but it will facilitate that. We have already reached out to school partners to see if there's any sort of motivation, excitement around this. There is a lot of work to be done before this gets completed. Strengthen affordable broadband access for all within the west end. Again, another issue I know this council is very, very concerned about. And perhaps with citizen assistance we could see some real progress in the area. Enhanced streetscape to increase mobility and beautification and then amplify local character through place making initiatives, helping to make the west end of Rock Island a place where people want to go, attractive places that people want to see. Enhancing that pride in the west end. That is a lot, and it's a lot of work to get done and how do we go about getting that work done? And this is a key point for this work moving forward, creating a West End community development corporation, a CDC to do this work, to staff this work, to drive this work, and to facilitate all of the resources that are within the west end and beyond. Towards this plan, this CDC will explore the creation of a West End special service area in SSA, which you all are well aware of and what it is. And then the King center will continue to be the backbone for this work. Again, the King center and being a backbone is not necessarily the influencer. We're not the influencer. We are the facilitator. We will be helping with community ownership through communications and community relations. We'll work with partners to get them engaged in the work. We will mobilize resources and we will be assisting in measurement and evaluation to see what sort of progress is being made, what missteps are being taken and how do we correct it so we can continue to move forward, as you all well know. I want to let you all know this, that, yes, you all were the first stakeholders where we wanted to see this plan, but that couldn't be. And so there have been others who have seen this plan. Great media coverage for the March 22 reveal and celebration. And since then, we've seen quite a bit of interest, in fact, even from private donors outside of Rock island. And I'm hoping within this month we're going to make another special announcement about the level of support we're going to see for this work moving forward. And what that will be able to allow us to do is to ramp up our efforts to continue looking at those resources that can help this work. There are a variety of grants, regional states and federal that wants to support this type of work. We do not have the internal capacity as of yet to really and truly actualize that and activate it for the work in the west end. In other words, bring in outside investment from outside of Rock island into Rock island for this work. And so the seed money that we are anticipating, we'll be using that to amp up our. Bolster our internal capacity, to make sure we can access those resources. How can our city council help with this work? Well, of course, we want you all to continue to be ambassadors and champions. You have been investors of this work. We have already seen a $300,000 grant come back to this work. We anticipate other opportunities to come and invest in this work, plus the results from the work itself, to continue to be open to policy change and remove and minimize barriers and streamline processes. I have the great honor of being here every two weeks with you all, and I get to see you all do that quite a bit. So this is right, aligned with the work that you're already doing, and then identifying and leverage other resources and opportunities that many of you all done for me. But now you have a broader opportunity to bring some of those resources into west end. And, of course, as you've asked, stay involved. We have been able to provide you quarterly updates for this work. And we appreciate you holding us not necessarily accountable, but showing true interest in this work. And with that, I'd love to open it up for your questions for me and or some of the experts that are in the audience with me today. I've got a question for you. I guess I'll start. So, on this $300,000 grant, where are those funds being. What are those funds being. Going towards? To people that may be listening in and not familiar with what's happening here today. Thanks.

So, on this $300,000 grant, where are those funds being. What are those funds being. Going towards? To people that may be listening in and not familiar with what's happening here today. Thanks. And that was one of the great questions we had at the reveal, and we're utilizing that for staff and internal capacity. There's a lot of work to be done with this sort of work, and most models for. For this work required, at minimum, five full time staff. Right now, with the addition of Mister Avery Pearl to our team, we have two full time staff for this work, and we need more capacity for that. So the majority of those dollars will be going towards that. As we continue to move forward, we will look for opportunities to show the community tangible ways that things are moving forward. And those dollars can go towards that as well. But the focus will be making sure we have that capacity to make this plan come to life. Another question while I'm at it here, so I know you've looked, maybe this was listed somewhere in here, but have you talked about doing pre, like the trades, like we've done several events on at the MLK center. Right, for pre apprenticeship programs? Have you. Is that something you're looking to do those are. And I guess it made me think about it when you were looking at the education savings accounts, because frankly, not everybody's a college person, but we do have a need for trades, and I didn't know if that's something that you've considered doing. Yes, steering working groups have considered that significantly, and it's in the details of the plan. And you're right, the incentivizing education funds is speaking to that. That is a viable and quite accessible opportunity for our community to be stable, to reinvest in our community. So the short answer to your question is yes. Okay, one last question for me. So you talked about the exploring the creation of an SSA. What kind of feedback are you getting from the residents in this proposed area? And I know that obviously raising taxes is an issue. And so I'm kind of wondering, have you done any kind of a survey on this to see what kind of support you have for that down there? Survey hasn't been done yet, but that work will have to occur. When this issue was brought up in work groups and student communities, and I wasn't there for each and every one of them, I was surprised by the level of support from those who live in that area, in this community that wanted to see this at least explored. Like you said, the concept of raising someone's taxes is not incredibly popular. But as you can see recently, if you can show people what will come of your investment and making sure that it's a participatory budgeting process, people are willing to invest in themselves, and that's the hope of this work moving forward. There is much work to be done to assess the feasibility of this work. That's all I have. I do. I have one, and it's just a curiosity thing. When you talk about creating a West End community development corporation, are you envisioning that as being, like, a nonprofit that will be started or staffed by volunteers? I was just curious. The vision at this point is it is a nonprofit organization spun off to its own self own governance, own staff. The King center will continue to be involved as a backbone until it can lift its own weight in that regard. But the King center and other organization will continue to be partners within the CDC as well. Okay. So it'd be structured like a 501 C so they could receive donations and stuff. Okay. Absolutely. Did you have something, Moses? No question. Just want to make a comment. Of course. Sure. I love the work that's being done. I thought it was on. I didn't do it. Yeah. Trying to cut me off. Just want to make a comment about I love how the work is being done, the process is being done, how it's inclusive to everyone, how informative it is, and the fact that we actually are taking our time and doing the data and letting the data drive the project. Typically what happens in these type of projects, it's being controlled from above and then pushed down. This is being done the opposite way. From the damp, from, from, from the ground up. It's being kind of constructed. I know with the SSA, we have done some initial conversations with people, but there's some, a lot of data that still needs to be done. As far as the SSA, kind of the background for that is to provide the necessary resource to ensure that this is successful. We know it's going to take a huge financial component to ensure that this goes on longer than two or three years outside of what we are receiving with the, with the donations. So we're looking for the longevity of it to ensure that it's successful. So again, to the staff, to the steering committee, thank you for a job well done. I know you have taken a lot of hours to get to this point right here, but this is just the beginning. So again, thank you.

It's being kind of constructed. I know with the SSA, we have done some initial conversations with people, but there's some, a lot of data that still needs to be done. As far as the SSA, kind of the background for that is to provide the necessary resource to ensure that this is successful. We know it's going to take a huge financial component to ensure that this goes on longer than two or three years outside of what we are receiving with the, with the donations. So we're looking for the longevity of it to ensure that it's successful. So again, to the staff, to the steering committee, thank you for a job well done. I know you have taken a lot of hours to get to this point right here, but this is just the beginning. So again, thank you. And just to add to that, I can't state enough how gratifying it was to work with working groups and citizens. People that live here have investment in this. When we first started out, we went to meet once a month. Working group said to us, nope, not enough. We want to be here more often trying to get this plan we have till February. So they agreed to twice a month meetings, much to Thurgood chagrin because he was there all the time. But nonetheless, it created a great plan and a plan, I think, that the community can get behind. So kudos to our great Rock island community. I guess I would like first is, I guess, a comment. Thank you for everybody volunteering their time and their efforts and knowledge, and it's very much appreciated. It really is. It is heartwarming to see that type of involvement. And like Mister Robinson said, bringing this from the ground up versus down, I think it makes a big difference. And so who knows better than what issues need to be addressed than those that live it, work with it day in and day out. And so that's very commemorative. My question is, or thoughts are, do we know? I'll say, get into the deep details. Do we need to? Is it a facility that's eventually going to be needing? And when you talk about staffing, what type of staffing do you know what type of staffing you need? Is there a specialty in fields or is it, you know, like trade training or those type of things? Your first question, a facility where there'll be a need for that. I anticipate that, but it's going to be closer to the third year that we'll be exploring that more deeply. Certainly the King center is, I'm having to create office space for all the folks that we have currently, so certainly wouldn't fit at our facility. And more importantly, for stronger community engagement, there needs to be a different building for people to latch onto and understand the work that's being done there. In regards to staffing, I think it's better to talk about the fact that in the next six months we're going to recruit a CDC visioning committee to help with the creation of the community Development Corporation. And so those questions can begin to be answered at that point in time, at least the foundational staff, and I'm not sure what will be needed at that point in time, but that will create the foundation for other staff we brought upon as the plan continues and as things evolve. Thoughts, comments? Anybody thought? Thank you very, very much. A lot of work. Well, thank you to the city council. If you all don't remember, let me remind you, you put $140,000 into this work about was it three years ago and was supportive of it when it first came to us. In regards to impossible investment into this work, things are coming to fruition. Although we're at the end of this process, we're at the beginning of another, and it's exciting to see what's going to happen for our city of Rock island. So thank you. Thank you, city council.

We've lived in Rock island now for ten years. We live on 15th block of 19th Avenue, like, right behind Longview apartments. I have some photos. I don't know if you guys want to pass these around. We've been fighting with the apartments off and on for ten years. Snow is a big one. We have a two car garage. We're at the end of the alley. So we share that alley. They plow us in every year. I mean, just bury us. I've called mayor's office. I've called. They put me to somebody else. Nobody knows anything. Like, I have city ordinances. Is there one? Some say there is, some say there isn't. I've contacted the apartment building. They have put me in touch with the plow guy. I called him. Yep. I'm gonna bring the skitter. We're gonna dig you out. Nope. I gotta hire a guy to come plow myself out. Now. Garbage is an issue. I did reach out to millennial today. They're finally. The supervisor is going to kick in, he's going to come out. But it is ridiculous, the amount of stuff that we're putting up with right there at the end of the alley. We've hit the garbage cans like the. When you back out of your driveway in the middle of the night. I work at 02:00 a.m. so you back out, you hit them. You don't see them there. Now there's light out there. There wasn't before. It's just been an ongoing problem. I don't know what else to do. I didn't have an alderman. Now there is an alderman. You know what I mean? I'm trying to keep up with it, but I don't know who to contact, who to solve the problem. I. Some say get the cops involved. The city did come out and put a. Two years ago, put a sign up. Don't put the snow next to the fence. You can see in the pictures that they've bent the fence and they bury the signal. So. And then after I talk to the gentleman, still comes out, plows us in right after I talk to him. So I'm asking for help. I don't know what to do. We don't do too much feedback here, but I can put you in contact with Luke, and he's the one that controls that, in charge of that, if you want to talk to him now or afterwards or whatever, but the two of you. And you can work on resolution to it. Yeah, that'd be great. I know we can't have download, but just one question. Is that his fence? Is that your fence or the property? That is my neighbor's fence. So when you come out of my garage, that'd be the to the left of it. So the elderly lady next to me, I just kind of keep an eye out on her, you know what I mean? But that is her fence. We bend it back a couple times a year, but now it's to the point where the bottom is a problem, you know? Appreciate it. Luke can work with you. All right, thanks. Thank you.

The cpace program, I became aware of it late last year, someone that I have been acquainted with in government for a number of years. Chris Meister is the director of the Illinois Finance Authority, and he was telling me about the program. I thought this was something really good for our area and our community, so I asked them to come and give a presentation on it. It fell on a date that was in conflict with a meeting with IML.

Those bonds are done by them, so it doesn't require any securities or anything to be done by the city. So you're not securing the loan, you're not financing the loan, you're not on it. What you do is you review the project simply by a discussion with the people that are involved in the development. This could be a commercial business. It could be a nonprofit. So if they wanted to do an expansion onto their business or if they wanted to construct a new brick and mortar facility for their business, they just talk to you about it. You would refer them to the Illinois Finance Authority, to the Cpace program with the simple movement of an email. Then they would go to them and talk to them. The term assessment scares a lot of people. It shouldn't, it isn't a tax. This is simply a way that they term use. It's a term within the financial instrument about what they're doing and how they're financing the loan, how they're going to pay for it. The Illinois Finance Authority itself is an economic tool that is a favorite of state government, the governor's office, and then routinely use the Illinois Finance Authority and various programs under it to put together complicated or larger projects. It's very good for us to establish ourselves as a local community that has a relationship with the Illinois Finance Authority. There are other programs under it that are very beneficial to you, as well as this one is to local business or nonprofits, local institutions, financial institutions, and people that would buy the bonds or loan the money like this structure. And so they offer these loans at lower interest rates, and that's what the benefit is, and that's where the economic development comes. We're providing a benefit to local businesses at a lower interest rate type of a loan. The Illinois Finance Authority is doing somewhat. If you go to their homepage, you'll see that they're somewhat branding themselves as the Illinois climate Bank. They've developed six programs there where they're collecting federal dollars for various clean energy programs that are coming into fruition and are funded so that we can take advantage of local communities and the state can take advantage of those funding opportunities for our state to expand clean energy, whether that's the charging stations that we've been talking about, solar, those types of programs, those federal. So these are like six financial baskets that they can collect money with. So just another reason why we want to have a relationship with the Illinois Finance Authority. So this program can assure you is of no risk to the city, financial or otherwise. It's an opportunity for us to help local businesses. Is there any questions or anything about it? Great.

Couple signatures. Good evening. Yeah. Okay. Public comment. We have two people that have signed up. Is it Robert Murphy? If you wish you had five minutes and explain what you wish. Well, I'm here on the subject of vacating 20th Avenue in Rock island off 46th street, going to the moline border. And I own the immediate house south of the gentleman's request to do this. And I own a couple other houses on that block. It's a public thoroughfare. It's an avenue. You vacate alleys and you vacate portions of easements. But I've never seen anybody vacate a street or an avenue. And this is a place where people have crossed over into Moline and into the businesses of Moline for over 50 years. And it's just like a water leak. You stick your finger in there and block it, going to have the people cutting through everybody's yard on that block to go the same, same way they've been going. It also. It also is going to eliminate parking for the person requesting this and his family on that avenue. If he chooses to get ownership of it, he can do anything he wants to with it. So he could fence it if he wants to. He could make the avenue dirt, plant, grass, whatever. But you cut the parking off for my house. You cut the garage off, it becomes a shed. And any parking for my house or his home goes onto the street. And the street below 20th Avenue and above 20th Avenue has one sided parking only. I've gathered 16 signatures within a 250 foot radius of the avenue that are against this. And I explained it based on the city's. One of. One of the gentlemen's letter he got and the city's picture of the avenue he wants to vacate. Now, he spoke to my daughter the other day and said that the city has it all wrong. He doesn't want them to vacate the avenue. He wants just a small portion for a garage. Well, it doesn't sound like there's somebody's story isn't straight. I think you guys just got the picture pretty well, covered with the entire avenue. So that being said, if this doesn't fly and he requests another vacation, I'd like to know the exact square footage. That way we get it right. But if you'd like the five copies I've made of the 16 signatures that oppose this within a 250 foot radius, you're welcome to. Yes, please, if you don't mind. We'll take them and that's fine. Thank you. You bet. Thank you. Okay. Travis Morris. How y'all doing? I'm the gentleman he talking about. Okay. Anyway, what I'm trying to do is secure my house because right there where the problem is at is right behind Village Inn. Okay? When I got cars broke in, you know, when people even today, you know, we seen dude on camera walking up our sidewalk, you know what I mean? They ride motorbikes through there and everything. You know what I mean? Twelve and 01:00 in the morning. He don't live there. He lives somewhere else. That's rental property. I'm just trying to get enough area to secure my house so I won't have that. You know what I mean? I had car broke in. My wife car broke in three times, you know, saying, they come, poor stolen cars down in there. The dead inside is covered by his property for his trees because he won't cut them back. He won't take care of his yard. So what I supposed to do? No, you're, you're going down the right avenue and the council will be discussing it tonight. Yeah. You know, and that's what I'm talking about. You know. Hey, I don't have no problem with him on his side. He only uses garage. He got a junk in there. Okay, thank you. Be at the podium, please, so we can hear you. I don't live there. Someone lives there. That's more important to me. To me. And that's my daughter. My daughter lives there. Okay. So. And there's a lady goes through there with a little motorbike and she's got a legal plate on it. And I don't, I don't. Didn't begrudge her a bit for not wanting to go on 18th Avenue just to go to jewel with all that traffic. And there is activity there sometimes of a night. And I get taxed for a garage and I get taxed for two front yards. That would be eliminated if you guys accepted this. Thank you. Thank you. All right. That's all that's signed up? Yes. Well, we dip.

If we could start with eight a, please. All right, I'm up. Right. Okay. Whereas amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, known by many as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive, fatal, neurodegenerative disease in which a person's brain loses connection with the muscles, slowly taking away their ability to walk, talk, eat, and eventually breathe. And whereas, every 90 minutes, someone is diagnosed with ALS and someone passes away from ALs and whereas, on average, patients diagnosed with ALS only survive two to five years from the time of diagnosis, and whereas, ALS has no cure and whereas, people who have served in the military are more likely to develop ALS and die from the disease than those with no history of military service, and whereas, securing access to new therapies, durable medical equipment, and communication technologies is of vital importance to people living with ALS, and whereas, clinical trials play a pivotal role in evaluating new treatments, enhancing quality of life, and fostering assistive technologies for those living with ALS. And whereas, we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the ice bucket challenge through a renewed commitment to galvanize public awareness and support funding leading to significant investments in ALS research. And whereas, the ALS association, as the largest philanthropic funder of ALS research globally, has committed over $154 million to support more than 550 projects across the United States and 18 other countries, and whereas, our commitment to accelerating the pace of discovery remains unwavering, fueled by the hope that one day ALS will be a livable disease for everyone, everywhere, until we can cure it. And whereas, ALS awareness month increases the public's awareness of people with ALS's dire circumstances and acknowledges the terrible impact of this disease has not only on the person, but on his or her family and the community, and recognizes the research being done to eradicate this disease. Now, therefore, I'm Mike Tomes, mayor of the city of Rock island. Do hereby proclaim May 2024 as ALS awareness month in the city of Rock island and call upon all its citizens to join in supporting ALS research, advocating for increased funding and standing in solidarity with those affected by the relentless disease. Is there anybody here with this? There was somebody that requested this and weren't sure if they were gonna be here. Nobody here? Okay. Thank you very much. B. Proclamation declaring May as mental Health Awareness Month. Angela and Annette, you can both go up. Okay? Whereas mental health is an essential part of overall well being, impacting individuals, families and communities across the city of Rock island. Whereas one in five american adults experiences a mental health condition each year and everyone faces challenges in life that can impact your mental health. Whereas, despite its prevalence, mental health remains shrouded in stigma, preventing many from seeking help. Whereas early intervention and access to quality care are crucial for managing mental health conditions and improving quality of life. Whereas May is recognized nationally as mental Health Awareness Month, providing an opportunity to raise awareness, combat stigma and promote mental health resources. Now, therefore, I, Mike Tomes, mayor of the City of Rock island, do hereby proclaim May 2024 as Mental Health Month in the city of Rock island and encourage all its residents of Rock island to educate themselves and others about mental health conditions, treatment options and available resources. Challenge stigma by speaking respectfully and inclusively about mental health seek help if they are struggling with their mental health and encourage others to do the same. Support organizations that provide mental health services and advocacy create safe and supportive environments for open conversations about mental health. Together, we can create a community where everyone feels empowered to prioritize their mental well being and seek help when needed. All right, there you go. Thank you. So, while everyone knows the great work the library does, I would like to give the podium up for just a couple minutes. Annette Clevenger, whose narratives is her organization and a lot of people are not quite familiar with them, but I would like to have her say a few words. Good evening.

So, while everyone knows the great work the library does, I would like to give the podium up for just a couple minutes. Annette Clevenger, whose narratives is her organization and a lot of people are not quite familiar with them, but I would like to have her say a few words. Good evening. As Alderman Hurt said, I am Doctor Annette Clevinger, and I am executor, director and founder of Narratives Community. See? And if you're not familiar with who we are, I'm here to tell you about it today so that you leave knowing about the work that we're doing and the fabulous young adults that I get to serve each day. Narratives is, I used to say, a new organization. But we, this is our fourth year, and so we are no longer new, and we are rapidly growing. We provide life skills coaching to young adults 17 to 25. I have been a native of the quat cities or here in Rock island for almost 50 years now and was in private practice as a clinician in the mental health field for over 20. And what I saw was there are wonderful resources and agencies in our community that help folks birth through 12th grade. But when you age out or magically turn 18, you're supposed to have figured it out. And the reality is so many of us, even with the greatest of supports in schooling, do not. And so narratives was created to help provide an extra level of support and connection for young adults in that age group. We work to provide them and empower them to find their path to success in the areas of housing, employment, education, which includes finishing and getting their geds, going on to college or finding trades employment in finding secure and sustainable employment. We work with them on life skills, if it's covered under the skills of adulting, cooking, finances, you name it. If you struggle with it, they do too. And we work to help them develop the necessary skills with life coaching, mental health support groups, individual one on one sessions. And everything that we do is undergirded with mental health because the reality is our mental health affects our ability to do any of those things well, to work, to live, to be in community. And so we work with them. I am here to tell you that the young adults of our community, those that you might consider vulnerable or at risk, are doing great and wonderful things. They are hardworking members of the community who want to become productive contributors, and they are, with a little help and a little guidance, they are finding their path to success. And it's a wonderful thing. And so, thank you. Thank you for the proclamation. Thank you for your willingness to consider financially supporting narratives in mental health. And I'm going to ask you for one more thing. Narratives is founded under the belief that our social capital is really what helps us all succeed. We all are here today because of who we know and how we know the network of relationships. And so the best way that you can help the young adults of the city of Rock island is to share narratives and to share their stories and to share that this resource is out there and available to them. It is 100% free for them to get the support that they need. So I implore you to use your networks. They are vast within the community to help them expand their networks and together we can do a better job. I also just want to thank you guys for investing in preventative and supportive care. So often when we think of mental health, we think of crisis things, and that's where we tend to invest our resources. But I'm a firm believer in this already text mental health system that when you invest in supportive resources, we will alleviate the mental health burden on our already tech system. So thank you. Thank you very much, Angela. Do you want to come up and talk about these products that are up here? The information? She did a great job. Part of our ARPA funding for our mental health initiative at the library. One portion of that is for promotion. Exactly the reason what she stated. It is to raise awareness and to get the word out that it is stigmatized. We need to stop that stigma as some of these bracelets stay so up there on the table are some pins. There's a card or sticker, both if you want, with a QR code that goes to our website and shares all of the different mental health resources we have in Rock island. Narratives is definitely on the list. The library partners with narratives as an example. We also, part of our ARp of funding is going towards programming that everyone can attend, that brings about these topics and has community conversations. It's just a comfortable place to be at the library, judgment free zone, et cetera. So we're really looking forward to that, doing those programs coming up this fall. And then we'll also have comfort carts that people who maybe don't know where to go or what to do, they can visit our comfort carts and get even more information and items that can help them if they are maybe struggling. Mental health is definitely on some continuum. One five reportedly have been diagnosed with a mental health disorder, which how many haven't? I personally have too.

Aye. Swanson? Aye. And Parker? Aye. Item twelve D. Report from the Community and Economic Development Department regarding a special ordinance establishing updating policies and procedures for the sale of residentially zoned, city owned vacant lots. First reading, motion to approve the updated policies and procedures and consider the ordinance. Second, move to second. Any discussion? Miles, are all these properties online? I'm glad you asked. They are all available online in both an excel form and interactive map. So anyone who's interested in seeing what's available for sale can go onto the city website, go to the search bar, put in available city properties, and they should be able to pull that up pretty easy. If this passes, we'll of course, update some of the information on the respective page to reflect the new pricing model. But it'll still be an interactive thing. So if someone's curious, is this vacant lot next to my house, a city owned lot I could buy? You can go on there and see it visually. I would say if this passes, this would be something our communications could get out and, you know, pump this out there to maybe sell some properties. Sure thing. We can coordinate on that, is there? No. I guess I have some hesitation in approving this update prior to our strategic housing plan. It's my expectation, perhaps, that part of the strategic housing plan would include how to better, more effectively pursue infill housing development. And now we're potentially opening up the floodgates to anybody who wants to own some land. Can do so. I mean, not, you know, it's anecdotal, but for example, a number of years ago, we sold that orchard in the first ward, I believe, and now it hasn't been maintained as well as we would have liked. Perhaps it just. I'm worried. I understand the desire to not have the city continue owning these, but are we perhaps a little premature and just sort of saying we don't want to have. Are we potentially creating more problems than we're solving by doing this? So can you speak on that? Sure. If you look at the language in the ordinance, staff have included a kind of disclaimer that any sites which are perceived to have serious development potential can be retained by the city. When we look at the potential for infill development, what we're most likely looking at is small scale development, but not individual houses on scattered sites. As an example, in the first ward, Alderman Robinson will be familiar with the former metro youth site, which the city nearly owns an entire block worth of property. That would be a good site for either set of houses done as a single development or. Or some sort of mid density development similar to what you might see a couple of blocks to the east on 9th street. Getting a developer to come in and do individual houses on these sorts of scattered sites, the sites that this ordinance is really intending to address is really a tall order. One of the things that staff would expect out of a strategic housing development plan is a recommendation in that plan that we focus our resources on sites where we can have that kind of clustered development and really facilitate some forward momentum and not spend as much time looking at these sites which are often too narrow to build on feasibly in locations where they can't maximize their profit margin, or which are just more generally unattractive for other reasons. The majority of the sites that are going to be affected by this are really sites where the neighbor should own it because they've been mowing it for years and they just want a little more room for their kids to play. As always, with all property sales, they will come before the city council for consideration. And if there is some concern in given case that a site should be retained for some reason because it might be an attractive development site, we can of course have that dialogue at that time. I suppose I'm troubled by the suggestion that we should abandon trying to pursue individual infill housing. There's a ton of neighborhoods in Rock island that have that one lot. I mean, my block is a good example. There's two empty lots, a few houses from my home where there once was houses that burnt to the ground. And so I don't find that satisfactory. And I think that we should be identifying ways to put houses back on these properties.

And if there is some concern in given case that a site should be retained for some reason because it might be an attractive development site, we can of course have that dialogue at that time. I suppose I'm troubled by the suggestion that we should abandon trying to pursue individual infill housing. There's a ton of neighborhoods in Rock island that have that one lot. I mean, my block is a good example. There's two empty lots, a few houses from my home where there once was houses that burnt to the ground. And so I don't find that satisfactory. And I think that we should be identifying ways to put houses back on these properties. Other communities have done it through TIF, through other resources. I'm hoping that the strategic housing plan does pursue that versus, as you're suggesting, says we shouldn't prioritize that. I think that this is premature, and I plan on voting now. Okay. Any further discussion? I like the idea of infill, too. Habitat for Humanity. It may be difficult, but pretty much everything that the city of Rock island has on its plate is difficult to do, and that's not a satisfactory reason to not do it. Right. All right, roll call. Alderperson? Healy. Aye. Robinson, did I hear. Aye. I'm sorry. Aye. Hurt. Maynard? Nay. Swanson? Aye. Parker? No. Motion carries. Item twelve e, report from the Community and Economic Development Department regarding a special ordinance establishing an updated new housing construction property tax rebate program. First reading, move to approve the updated new housing property tax rebate program and consider suspend the rules and pass the ordinance. Second, move to second. Any discussion was this. Is this land bank idea? Is that where this came from? No, it actually came up because I asked whether or not we could find the original enabling ordinance for a program that we've had for decades, and no one could find it. So we rewrote it. It doesn't change, really, anything about the fundamentals of a program we've had for ages, except for one thing, which is that it includes, for the first time, the addition of gut rehab houses. So if someone buys a property, strips it down to the studs and rebuilds it all to current code, they've effectively, under this ordinance, created a new unit of housing that can be incentivized through the rebate. So it's basically what we've always had, what we've always budgeted for. It doesn't cost us anything because we get. We just turn the money back around to the person. But that is the one change. That addition rocket on. My own school district has one that mirrors this, correct? So ours can stand alone as long as the school district continues to approve theirs. You can double up on it. We don't have that many tools to encourage, you know, say, infill development on those vacant lots. This is really the one we have. And it has a good track record of success. Yep. Okay, roll call.

And we're going to start this out with a sad note to a certain degree. Happy for him, sad for us. But Chief Landy is retiring. This Friday will be his last day. And so we, you know, he's going to be missed. He's been here for quite a long time. I personally got to know him over the last, well, actually for the last couple years as chief, but then even before that, I worked with him, and I can't say enough. I've gotten to, we got to understand each other's personalities a little bit. We've had some differences on some issues, but at the end, we work together and we're, and it's been a very great, wonderful pleasure to work with you, chief. And we've spent some time in DC and started some new programs. And, you know, I've talked to other people in Moline and Davenport and everything else in the law enforcement, and he is highly respected throughout the industry and the, I want to say the relationships that he's built have been wonderful and a strong point, a strong help to the city of Rock island, even the state's attorney, once again, we've had some meetings together there also, and working with the state's attorney on different issues and the respect that he pulls there on that part of it carries a lot of weight, and so he will be missed. And I know your wife was right behind you, is not only physically behind you, but in retirement, surely behind you at this point. So we'll have another one. But sorry to see this happen, but it's well deserved, that's for sure. I'd like to come down here before you speak. I'd like to come down for a second. Todd, you're going to come down, too, I try to get smart, save this walk a few times, and use this portable mic. Yes, exactly. Yeah, come on down. No, what I'd like to do is the chief was asked for a few minutes to speak, and we'll allow him to do that. I'll cut him off if he gets too long, but we want to present him with a little plaque that needs to have a little fix on it, but wanted to once again continue to say thank you very much for your service. It's. Well, you've done a great job. It's hard to say these first responders over the years, especially in the pandemic and everything else, some tough moments that you had to work through. And so I just cannot say enough for what all you've done. And so thank you very, very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Really appreciate it. There's that. Okay, real quick, before you. Is any council members wish to say anything? They're more than welcome to anybody a council member. We know better than that. He's got a few days left on the duty. If you really say how you feel, you might get picked up. We still have to drive home. Yeah, I gotta drive home. Chief, this floor is yours. Thank you very much, council. Thank you for giving me this moment to address all of you. I wanted to take this time to personally thank the city council, the city administration, and most of all, the citizens of Rock island for giving me the opportunity to serve the community as a member of the Rock island police department for the past 30 years. In the two and a half years since I took leadership of the Rock Island Police Department, I'm proud to say we've achieved many significant accomplishments over that time. The police department's enacted numerous operational policies and procedures and changes related to the Safety act, the most significant being the transition to no cash bond pretrial release system, which was largely unprecedented in scope. We completed the police department's third reaccreditation as part of the ILEEP program and tier two status, we partnered with family resources to provide crime victim support and assistance with a violent crime specialist assigned the police department. We successfully completed the transition to the new p 25 radio network for police, fire and emergency services in Rock Island, Scott county. We implemented a new records management and CAD 911 dispatch system. We added automated license plate recognition systems that ring the city and have proven their value in helping the police department ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Rock Island Police Department", "insights": [{"observation": "The police department enacted numerous operational policies and procedures and changes related to the Safety Act, the most significant being the transition to a no cash bond pretrial release system.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We partnered with family resources to provide crime victim support and assistance with a violent crime specialist assigned to the police department.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We successfully completed the transition to the new P25 radio network for police, fire, and emergency services in Rock Island, Scott County.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We implemented a new records management and CAD 911 dispatch system.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We added automated license plate recognition systems that ring the city and have proven their value in helping the police department.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "First responders had to work through some tough moments, especially during the pandemic.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Rock Island Police Department", "insights": [{"observation": "The police department enacted numerous operational policies and procedures and changes related to the Safety Act, the most significant being the transition to a no cash bond pretrial release system.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We partnered with family resources to provide crime victim support and assistance with a violent crime specialist assigned to the police department.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We successfully completed the transition to the new P25 radio network for police, fire, and emergency services in Rock Island, Scott County.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We implemented a new records management and CAD 911 dispatch system.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We added automated license plate recognition systems that ring the city and have proven their value in helping the police department.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "First responders had to work through some tough moments, especially during the pandemic.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 3160, "chunk_end_time": 389884, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BGEEZFwrAM", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BGEEZFwrAM&t=3s"}, {"start": 4000, "end": 10000, "text": " and a half years since I took leadership of the Rock Island Police Department, I'm proud to say we've achieved many significant accomplishments over that time.

We added automated license plate recognition systems that ring the city and have proven their value in helping the police department safeguard the city. On April 26, we joined with six other Illinois law enforcement agencies and the Rock Island County NAACP to adopt the ten shared principles of trust. Shortly afterwards, the Rock Island Police Department, along with the other agencies. For this commitment, the Rock Island County NAAC awarded us the Rock Island Police Department with a 2023 law enforcement image award. Working with the city's it and public works departments, we expanded the city's camera network to four more intersections of the city, and I'm hoping to see those expansions continue further. We've doubled the number of community service officers and expanded the role to handle more enforcement and reporting. To help free up police officers for more patrolling and available to handle more serious calls, we conducted our first full audit of our evidence inventory, which was something I've always wanted to accomplish when we got it done. This consisted of over 27,000 pieces of evidence. It was a monumental effort that the team completed on time and on budget. Working with the Rock Island Milan School District reintroduced a school resource officer to the high school. We strengthened our partnerships with the Rock Island Arsenal by entering into another intercovermental support agreement to manage the Rock island, excuse me, the arsenal's police and fire radio service maintenance. And in 2022, we began working with the Davenport Police Department to expand group violence intervention GBI to Rock island. And in 2023, we started working with Moline police Department for a shared automatic, or, excuse me, automated biometric fingerprint identification system, aid in our criminal investigations division, solving cases. And again, those are coming here tonight for the council's approval. Had it not been for the support of the city's administration, my fellow department directors and their staff, and that of the city council, many of these achievements would not have happened. So I'd like to personally thank all of you for your unwavering support of the police department and for the service to the citizen. Your service to the citizens of Rock island. It's been a pleasure working with all of you. And then finally, in closing, it's been an honor to have spent these final years of my career serving as police chief. I am so proud of the men and women of the Rock Island Police Department for their dedication to duty and professionalism. I'd like to single out one member of the police department in particular, my wife, debris. Lord knows I'm no box of candy at times, and she's. But she's always been there, and we've stuck through this together. And so I thank her also to the citizens of Rock island. The citizens of Rock island can take comfort in knowing that they have one of the finest police departments serving the community. Thank you very much. Okay, we're going to stick working on the move here. I guess we got seven a now we got to do an oath. Oath of office for Jessica Sager, city treasurer. Finance director. Your voice does carry.

You want to come on up? You know, I was at a seminar. I can't remember where I was at the other day, but there's a shortage of internal audits. There is a big shortage. There's a lot of small communities, municipalities that have not been able to get audits and or share it with other ones because of the shortage. And so we do need to recognize it and encourage people to get involved and do this. So come on up for a photo. We lost Sarah Hayden, but come on up here. She's back. Julie, do you want to get in the photo? Yeah. Julie, the president of the chapter. Oh, that's important to be up here then. But who would have thought there was an internal audit day or week? Not a lot of money. Yeah, my wife likes a birthday all month long, but, you know, but this, please, if you want to say something, we'd be more than welcome to here to take this with you. Thank you and thank you. Sure. I'll say a few words. Roberto Leone. I'm the academic relations chapter chair. Julie Applegate is our president. We have other members here. The IA chapter represents eastern Iowa and the Quad Cities corridor. We have private and public sector representation. I just want to thank the council and the mayor for acknowledging the month of internal audit awareness.

Anything new people want to bring up? Well, I just want to recognize Courtney Lindsey, Rock island graduate, graduate of Texas Tech University. He is currently representing the United States. Well, he will be representing United States track and field in Paris. He was currently, I think right now, he has the fastest 200 meters time in the world. So I just want to give that out. Sarah, if we can probably do something for him. I know we put a billboard up before what the community has. So just to recognize his accomplishments, as I know we have tons of different youth or alumni from. From Rock island doing positive things. So just want to put that out there. Anybody else? Anything? I got a couple items. Very positive. Everybody else. The Labor Day parade, as everybody knows, is quite a popular parade here in Rock island. Bands are popular with that parade. But due to help with the Rock island high school band director, we were able to secure the Illini band to come and play and walk in the parade. And then, actually, I think we're going to do a presentation at the high school stadium afterwards. So that's quite an accomplishment. They're in high demand. They've won a lot of state and national competitions. There's 300 and some odd 360, I think, band members. It's quite a, quite a scene. So it's going to add for the 40th anniversary, a great feather in our cap and fun to have so that we've locked that in. So that's a wonderful thing. The other one is, if you remember the city council, you ladies and gentlemen, had voted and gave us some land, basically gave some land to community home partners by, on 11th street and 31st Avenue, basically behind the McDonald's and that sort of thing for them to build these smaller homes for vets. They just got word that that got funded. So they hope to be. And actually, I got a part of a news release here, but that will be $7.8 million project to hopefully start this fall and be completed mid next year. So we will hear more and see more about that in the near future. Future. We did save, if you remember right, there's still an acre or so in front, right along 31st Avenue for hopefully some commercial or some type of development there. So this would be set back behind that, back into the wooded area a little bit. Four and a half acres, give or take. So that'll be a great, great project for veterans to have a place to live. There'll be a community center there for them with a lot of services that they need very handy. And so it's a very positive project for Rock island. And a piece of land that we own now can be more productive. So that's positive situation happening. So I guess those are two things that you want to bring forth. One more thing, Mister mayor. Yes. Just to remind folks that on April 27, the Rock Island Police Department will be having their police benevolent association, not the police department. They'll be having their annual taco dinner and silent auction. And that'll be held at. I can't even pronounce this memorial hall, Sacred Heart, I guess I said 1400 16th Avenue in Moline. The $7 per plate down there. And they use that to fund some of the unpaid medical bills for the officers, like glasses and hearing. No longer hearing aids, but glasses. Great way to drive up the price on the, on the items for me, Mark. Thanks. Thank you. It's a great event, though. But to continue to, I guess, positive things, you know, of course, the new WCA had their kind of opening. They move in, I think, May 1 or something. Part of May, they officially move over to that new, beautiful facility and expand some of the services that they've been offering. Positive thing for Rock island community as a whole.

We talked, I think we had Jack while back talked about Arts Alley and the artists, and we had over 400 artists make proposals to work down there in Arts Alley. They got it narrowed down to ten, I believe, and at least that's last I heard. So those are all positive things. Still continue. The federal, I keep calling the federal courthouse, which it is, but it's also about six other agencies going to be in that building that continues to move forward, and they're working hard on the interior of that, unfortunately, still have a number of months left for that. But continuing with those type of things, resurfacing part of 31st Avenue down there is going well. Interesting. I had one of the business owners down there at first, and normally this business owner complains about a lot of things. He called and started it that way, said, boy, it's a cluster down here, he says, but it's a necessary cluster. And the contractor is doing a great job, very efficient, and working with the businesses. So he had compliments to say about that project, which is positive to hear. Sometimes you don't always hear that, but. So it was a necessary evil. But like the businesses downtown, we'll find also. But so there's, it continues in other parts of the city, these positive things happening throughout. And thank you for everybody up at this table. And then, of course, the staff that implemented once again to continue to do these wonderful things, MLK facilitating the revitalization down in that area, continue to work that forward as a positive issue to help the west end continue to be productive and beautiful, as it should be.

There you go. I can turn it on, too. So march, as we know, is historic Preservation month, and I'm pleased to represent the preservation community in Rock island. First off, I think a lot of times when we come before you to talk about preservation, we really fail to acknowledge the role that the city plays in preservation in Rock Island. I know a lot of people get all confused because we have a Rock Island Preservation commission and a Rock island preservation society, and we have a whole bunch of different things that say Rock island something, something. So I did want to point out that the Rock Island Preservation Commission is a city commission, and we do, or I do anyway, for sure. But thank the city for having such a commission, for deciding to.

I know a lot of people get all confused because we have a Rock Island Preservation commission and a Rock island preservation society, and we have a whole bunch of different things that say Rock island something, something. So I did want to point out that the Rock Island Preservation Commission is a city commission, and we do, or I do anyway, for sure. But thank the city for having such a commission, for deciding to. To support one, and to give us a mechanism to actually nominate and protect specific structures in Rock island that are deemed historically significant in our town. I was surprised to find out how many we actually have. We actually have 40 designated landmarks, 42, I believe, after our last commission meeting. And we have one local historic district, which is Highland park. We also have national Register historic districts like the downtown and Broadway, and those are all always well known. They do not come with the restrictions that come with somebody that has an actual Rock island preservation listing. We have more National Register sites in Rock island than any of the other communities on this side of the river. Will never probably catch up with Davenport because they had a full time employee 2030 years ago that spent all of her time putting things in Davenport on the National Register. So we would have a lot of work to do to get that far. But anyway, tonight, before I really get really started, I do want to thank the city staff for all your help. So give them a round of applause tonight, too. Sure. That's okay. So the first project we would like to recognize tonight is the construction of an appropriate garage for a landmarked home, the Leonard Drac house at 836 22nd street. Owners Robin and Mark McVeigh constructed a garage, except for its auto doors. Looks like it could have been built decades ago. The owners constructed the garage with a steeply pitched roof and clapboard siding that is made from cement wood fiber material rather than less expensive vinyl. The gables have been trimmed with wood shingles, replicating existing trim on the house, and the windows are vintage salvaged double hung. Architect Leonard Drac local architect Leonard Drac designed and built this home for his family in 1904. He was a partner in the firm of Dracon Currents, which designed many prominent buildings, including the Rock Island Downtown Public Library, the London Building, now Quad City Arts and Studio 483, the Sala apartment building and Emmanuel Lutheran Church, now Grace City Cathedral. The home has been in the current family for over three decades, and the owners taking care of the home today are descendants of Rob from Robin's family. Because the home is an official Rock island landmark as of 1994, the owners are required to get approval from the preservation commission before they can construct a garage on their property, and they gladly did. So. Now we'd like to recognize Robin and Mark McVeigh for a job well done. She'll take your photo here and we'll one of the reasons why when I moved here from Chicagoland, I chose to live in Rock island and was because of the preservation effort, and it's a good resource to draw people into this community. And I've been here for over 30 years, and I just wanted to put a plug in for that. Thank you. Our next award goes to the Rock Island Bible Church purchased and their membership. The membership purchased the former Broadway Presbyterian Church in November of 2022 under the leadership of Pastor Doug Roland and with the help of congregational members, volunteers and local contractors, repairmen and restoration projects project managers, restoration of the building began. Tuck pointing of an exterior stonework of the exterior stonework and chimneys was done by Bi State Masonry, a company located here in Rock island. This included tuck pointing around existing stones and replacements for the few that were missing or broken. They used original stone found on the grounds to make these replacements. To replicate the historic tuck pointing, custom convex trowels had to be created. Notable attention to detail. The church also repaired and replaced missing gutters and downspouts on the building. Some of the original downspouts had been stolen. Some of the gutters were deteriorated. Sections that needed to be replaced were done so with color matched patina to not take away from the originals. In other areas, existing gutters, too deteriorated to hold water, were saved by lining them with aluminum. Gutter work was done by Mike Schwartz of Schwartz roofing and gutters from Davenport. Mike also repaired and repainted the building's exterior trim and wood windows and sills. The tall steeple at the north side of the building was painted in off white and topped with an inlaid cross accented in blue. Further exterior work involved repairing and replacing exterior lighting. Although our awards are not based on interior work, the Bible church has not neglected perfect their interior. Here, work was focused on needed maintenance and repairs, including the boiler, plumbing, and plaster repair. The plaster repair is reportedly being done by a skilled member of their congregation. Pastor Roland is not here tonight. He is serving on a mission in Guatemala, and somehow that does not surprise us. But here tonight to receive the award is church elder DJ Bradley.

Proclamation declaring June as Pride month whereas LGPTQ plus communities of Rock island are an integral part of the vibrant culture and climate of Rock island, and whereas, the diverse LGBTQ community continues to contribute to the widespread academic, economic, artistic, and social spheres within and around our greater community, and whereas, this month of June was designated prime month to commemorate the Stonewall riots, which occurred in June of 1969 and are generally recognized as the catalyst of the LGBTQ rights movement, and whereas, the city of Rock island remains committed to protecting the civil rights of LGBTQ communities, as the power and purpose of this iconic event proved vital in all our unified efforts to forge a more open and just society, and whereas Rock Island's active and involved LGBTQ communities make an indelible impact upon the quality of life in Rock island, in Pride Month serves as a call to our collective consciousness to persist the fight to eradicate prejudice and discrimination everywhere.

That's unfortunate. Not as exciting, I guess. Let me see. I wonder if that was planned. Oh, they don't want to hear about the financial numbers or the police playing kickball or the cheap. Well, good evening, mayor, members of city council. Before you tonight are the first quarter financials for 2024. I'm not going to read the memo before you. That was in the packet. The first quarter benchmark for revenues and expenditures is 25%. The general fund, which, you know, is used to account for most departments and some of the smaller funds, reported revenue at 16% and expenditures at 24%. As I mentioned in the memo, some of the tax revenue that was received in January and February was accrued back to 2023, which is typically how we proceed. So I'll touch on that a little bit more as we get to the charts that are towards the back of the packet. Special revenue funds, such as public library fund, reported revenue at 2% and expenditures at 20%. The TIF districts, which are all combined together, reported revenue at 2%, while expenditures were reported at 8%. The largest source of revenue for both the library and the TIF funds is property tax revenue, and we anticipate the first distribution at the end of this month, so you'll see those numbers increase with the second quarter quarter financials. The riverboat gaming fund revenue was at 14% and expenditures were at 0%. We just received the invoices for the debt that we have to transfer, so we'll be transferring those payments from the debt service fund at the middle, towards the middle of June and then again in December. So you'll see those numbers increase with those the second quarter financials and then again with the fourth quarter financials. ARPA expenditures were budgeted at approximately $16 million for 2024, and actual expenditures for the quarter totaled 13% of the budget the Martin Luther King Community center operations Fund reported revenue at 23% and expenditures at 25%, while the Community and economic Development fund reported revenue at 19% and expenditures at 11%. At the end of March, enterprise funds such as water, wastewater, stormwater and solid waste funds reported revenue above the 25% benchmark and expenses for water, wastewater and stormwater were below the benchmark, while expenses for solid waste were above the benchmark at 27%. The Parks and Recreation fund revenue was at 11%, again because of the property tax revenue, distribution and expenses were reported at 17%. Closing journal entries for the sunset marina need to be performed once the city's annual audit is completed. Once those entries are done, first quarter will be reconciled and will more accurately reflect revenue and expenditures for 2024. If you noticed in the report, it looked a little off, and that's why we just haven't done some of the closing journal entries that need to be done. That we'll do once the audit is done. The MLK Community center fund reported revenue at 29% and expenses at 24%. At about 50% of the general fund revenue is received from state and local taxes. As I mentioned before, the majority of the tax revenue that was received in January and February was accrued back to 2023. So you'll notice some of the categories only note two months of distributions when you're looking at the charts that had all of the state tax revenues, this is our typical process because the state receives the revenue and disseminates the payments two to three months behind. At the end of the first quarter, income tax revenue was at 25% of the budgeted amount. Replacement tax revenue was at 20.7 of the budgeted amount at the end of March. In reviewing distributions this morning that we received in May, it's on track to meet the budgeted amount of 6.5 million. Again, in reviewing those distributions that we received in May, sales tax is on track to exceed the budgeted amount of $3.1 million, while local option sales tax is slightly below the targeted benchmark at 23.2%. Telecommunication tax and used tax are also below the targeted benchmark of 25%. They are at 22.1 and 22.5%, respectively. Municipal utility tax, local food and beverage tax and gaming tax revenue are all slightly below the benchmark as well. They are all at 22.523.8 and 22.9% overall. These percentages are fairly consistent with where we were with first quarter of 2023, so we are not concerned. We ended 2023 pretty strong where revenue was and were right where we were at 2023. Finally, the monthly investment interest report indicates the average interest rates that were paid out during the first quarter months varied. Some of the investment rates rose consistently, while some increased and then had a slight decrease. The city received a combined total of just over $650,000 in interest in the first quarter. So with that, I am happy to answer any questions you might have at this time. We got any questions done. Thank you. Wonderful. Good numbers. All right. Item eleven a through f. Consent agenda.

First reading. Motion to deny the request. Second move to second. Any discussion. I would like to state that that is an ambulance route. It's a wide. Sure would not that 24th street south of 18th Avenue is an ambulance route. Coming in from moline and putting a speed bump there would be disadvantageous to the patients. Really disadvantageous. So I know I fielded calls today as well even though it wasn't my ward, but got some people that were not happy. So do we have access to. And I mean interrupt, but access to, like. I know we have like some emergency routes. Do we have those, like, declared within the city so when this comes up we can have that kind of identified. I'm looking at the fire chief. All we have is snow routes for public works. Okay. Yeah. The two main entrances of the hospital will be 17th street and 24th street. And it's not just our community, it will be half of Moline Davenport. There's multiple agencies that are going to be coming into Rock island. And I think my biggest struggle with it, you're going to put a speed hump across four lanes of traffic. And to me, that's not advantageous to anybody. Could we kind of define that? Right when we put this together, that was supposed to be residential, not kind of more of our. More main thoroughfare thoroughfares. Yeah, I think that was the intent was more residential areas. The ordinance or the policy says 300 traffic count up to a maximum of 5000. And most of our north south corridors, 18 or 1724 30th are pushing that 5000 number or above the 5000. So, yeah, this would, this would exceed the traffic count numbers that we would be looking to install these at. We'd also want to take into consideration with Rock Island High School also. So we'll avoid that area to respond to the hospital during peak times. So 24th street becomes more advantageous for us to use. I mean, I have no. No issues with. I'm just. I'm just asking questions right now. Is it in writing? Or not specific, just so because we won't have this again with another street. And I have spoke with Pinta, who's, who made the request last week. We had a great conversation. She understands the reasoning for the denial. She just wished that was approved. So they just have some concerns with speed then? With speed? Yeah, they. And they live right on 24th street, so they. Oh, yeah. Roll call, please. Would you have something? I'm sorry, Dylan. Yeah, sure. I was just going to add speeding. I mean, speed humps or speed humps, not bumps, are one solution. But in addition, are those devices that show you how fast you're driving. Right. We have one, two mobile ones. We have three. And we actually have two that are going to be set up. We've. I've kind of set up. They're going to be at school zones primarily. We're looking at 9th street between Edison and Pearl Hansen. Think about that. And then the other one was the Eugene field over on 31st Avenue. So. So I know that it's just a matter. From what I understand, it has them. They've got them set. These are not the same ones that the other three that are mobile we use whenever we get a request for speeding is a problem. So we put these in place where they actually send that information. We can log into them and see it live and everything else, and it records it. These just display the information like you see in other school areas and the other quad cities. So we're trying to move that way also. So we bought two of those, but I guess they're a little bit larger, need a little bit more robust setup. So I think it's working with public works on a pole to put those in place. And we hope to have them up soon. Very good. That was going to be my question. If we could look into permanent devices in some of our problem areas, I think that's a great way to go. Again, it's just cost every year we budget for them. So we bought two last year. I believe we have money for it this year also. So we'll buy two more. I wanted to focus on the schools primarily first, and then from there we can move out. But we still have the ones that are mobile, that we move around as needed. Thank you, chief. Can I ask how much are the. What's the cost for the. For those devices? I believe the two we just bought were five little over 5000. Okay, thank you. Hey, roll call, please.

Good. Yes, thank you. I'll step in from my colleague here. We do have one positive thing to report. Working together, Mister Flaherty and I teamed up with bi state to submit a grant application. The grant would fund a plan for the port. So this would lay out how the port authority should function, what sorts of initiatives it should have, how we should prioritize different infrastructure investments and other things. We're going to kind of cross our fingers and hope that we get that grant with bi state's help, and then can kind of move on to some of the next phases of planning for the future of this important economic development tool. So, anyway, we'll keep the council up to date, and when we hear back about that, we will let everyone know. What's the potential dollar amount? Say again? Potential dollar amount. So the grant application amount is just shy of a half million. There's a 20% match that we will need to throw in there, and we've discussed with the city manager the feasibility of doing that. Keep in mind that laying out a planning document like this is really essential to pursuing other funding sources down the road. So if we need to do significant streetscaping, improvements down there for mobility of trucks in and out of the port area, predominantly in the sunset business park area, or if we want to partner with the private sector, to do, like, an intermodal facility near one of the barge terminals. We need to be able to have a plan ready. To submit. With that grant application to the DC or whatever. So the plan really is worth the cost. So just quick question. With this grant, is it possible to use that for dredging. And other things at the marina? No, not at this time. So this grant is purely for the creation of a plan. The primary costs associated with this planning process. Are doing collection of different assessments of the area. Where different technical specialists. Would be brought in. To do kind of an in depth, data driven analysis. Of both the barge terminals. The infrastructure connecting to the barge terminals. This could extend throughout the whole of the city, mind you.

To do kind of an in depth, data driven analysis. Of both the barge terminals. The infrastructure connecting to the barge terminals. This could extend throughout the whole of the city, mind you. Because, of course, the port district and the city are coterminous geographies. So grants later on, that plan having been created and laid out. What priorities we have. Could be for things of that sort. Of course, there's some interest in seeing if dredging at the marina, but also around the barge terminal terminals themselves. Is something we could secure funding for down the road. So it could have wide ranging effects. We've been told that at this point, in most cases, the dredging is not an acceptable one to apply for. You cannot. You can use it for transit docks, you can use it for maybe electrical wiring upgrades. You can use it for equipment to buy roads. But dredging is exempt, unfortunately, with the port district. Because there's also some dredging needed. Believe it or not, right outside where alter is leasing, the city owns there on the seawall. Dredging needs to be done there. And unfortunately, that's not one you can apply for. But something important to note about that, mayor, and we've talked about this quite extensively. Is partnership with the private sector. So there might be things that the public sector. Can leverage. Through the port district. To make improvements. And then a private sector partner or collection of partners. Could come in and do things. Things just as an example, like dredging when the port itself cannot. So there's a lot of opportunity here. And again, part of the planning process. Is to decide. Exactly what the nature of the port should be organizationally. And how to engage some of those private sector partners. To leverage as much as possible. All of the different resources, public and private, that can be brought to bear. Correct. And I can't remember if you mentioned. But once again, even those private investments or whatever private request terminals come through the city. Those would be requested. So grant applications for a new crane at altar company. For them to use strictly. That grant request would still be the city's request in on behalf of that private business. And so that still comes through the city. But that's what Miles had talked about. And then in exchange, they didn't have to make that investment. So could they make the investment in dredging instead? And that's where the partnership becomes viable. So the good news here is, though, it seems like not too much is going on now with the port, we're starting to kind of get the ball rolling. And hopefully in the months to come, we can start to get a better handle on exactly what it'll look like. And I do want to compliment my colleague beside me here for his work in kind of corralling some of these issues. The port feels at times like a bit of a nebulous thing. What does it mean that we are one or have one? And Tom has been doing an excellent job of kind of pulling all of these threads together and pulling us into the future with the board. Does this grant. Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Tom. Well, I just wanted to add that the work that's gone into developing this grant request is really more of a planning opportunity than economic development. And that's why this tandem has worked so well. This was right in Miles Wheelhouse, and I think we've put together a very good grant application. The same time we've been doing this, I have been down in the industrial park all over sunset. I've visited with well over half of the businesses down there. We know who has expansion plans. We know who's having a little bit of trouble right now. And so when this plan comes into fruition, those are the kind of relationships we'll be utilizing. Mister Parker, you have something. Is this grant from the Illinois dot who's funding the grant that we're applying for? This is a federal grant to state? Yeah. It's administered through the state. State. And is it the DNR or the DNR? Yeah. We've been talking about a lot of different grant opportunities, to be honest with you. It's okay. I just hope that we know to whom we are asking for money. That seems to be an important detail that we should have figured out. Yes. Are we enlisting our lobbyists in this endeavor? Yes. Okay. Fortunately, this specific one is not what they call competitive grant. Now, it's not just a slam dunk. You got it. But it's not a competitive. And they're, at this point, currently, is enough funds in there to be able to do this. I just want to clarify. I just looked it up. It is the Illinois Department of Transportation. Okay, another discussion. Can we have a motion to exit the Rock Island Regional Port Authority? Is there a motion to exit the Rock Island Regional Port Authority meeting. Second. Move to second.

I've seen some of these warning signs near some of the schools that let people know that you have traffic coming out. And what I was thinking about was, is it possible for us to do the same thing for. We have our fire station on 30th street. You know, people are just coming around that corner there. And if we could look into something like that, at least to have a warning for the. I know some of the other cities do it. They have the warning signs that, you know, brts are exiting. 30 street does have some signs that they're approaching a fire station. It just seems at that specific location, we have had a consistent problem with traffic. We have worked with traffic engineering. There are some limitations due to the location being near 18th Avenue and 30th street. So we're trying to develop some different solutions to that problem, and it's specific to that fire station. Thank you. Anything else? People would like to bring up stress. If possible, I'd like to discuss what we chatted about earlier this afternoon on the phone with miles and yourself. Miles, could we have a recap? Is this is the annual action plan that we are putting forth? Is that my understanding? Correct. So, just for clarity, the council members, I was intending to send out an email probably tomorrow morning summarizing all of these matters. I also need to contact other parties about this as we have discussed it, and I want to make sure that they have ample notice of it as well. We have not had that opportunity to let them know kind of the status of things and where they stand now. All right, that is unfortunate timing. I wish that we could speak a little more openly about it, but if you haven't had those conversations yet, then we ought not. With the indulgence of the council, I would like to show the courtesy to those other parties about kind of where things stand and make sure they have the full information before a public discussion is had. Okay, we will this. It won't be discussed until the last week in May for a vote. So there'll be two other meetings between now and then that can be discussed, that that will be informed. Correct. I. I would just prefer to show them the courtesy of not discussing it tonight until they receive that email with the same information. Okay. I'm happy to. Happy to answer any. Any questions individually with council members if you feel a need to follow up with that, though. So I think it needs to be discussed publicly as a group, not just individual phone calls and emails. That was my point of trying to bring it up this evening. But I understand your point, and we should be respectful to our partners, so that's fine. We can talk about it at the next council meeting. Okay. Item number 20 has been pulled from the agenda. I forgot to mention that item 20, closed session, has been pulled from the agenda and not happening. So then I'd like to have a motion to adjourn. Motion to adjourn. Second. We'll be second. Any discussion? All those in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? Thank you.

Sorry for the pause there. I had a recent job change. Still getting used to it. I am here to talk about this evening, our at risk youth program, the place to be. The place to be has been up and running in various forms for over ten years now. Currently, we do have 84 youth on our roster. We average between 18 and 27 a night, with Fridays being our most attended evening, which shocks me. When I was that age, I had other things to do. But these youth are choosing to come to the place to be. They're coming because they're able to interact with adult mentors. They receive a hot meal. They have basketball and crafts and various other activities that they do with mentors. They've been swimming. They've gone ice skating. In February, they took place in a crafts evening in Moline. Wise, staff picks the youth up. They bring them to the center and they also take them home. In addition to the activities, the youth also receive intake and assessment where they meet with either Edwin, the director, myself, or one of the other mentors who talks to them about their life goals and what they're looking to accomplish so that we can help them do that. We perform life skills assessments with each youth and help direct them in that manner. Currently, we also have youth in our transitional housing program, one who is just turned 20. I keep saying she's 19. She'd kill me if she was here. Just turned 20. She is working full time now for Aramark at the John Deere site. She has a 14 month old in the YWCA daycare and is getting some supplemental help from us while she gets on her feet. So we're really proud to provide those services for the youth here in the Quad Cities, specifically in Rock island. You look like you had a question. Sorry. No. Okay. I don't know. Like I said, I just wanted to make you aware and see if there were any questions that I could answer about the activities that we are currently providing to provide any more information for you. Appreciate it very much. Typically, it's just people are explaining their story, telling the story, but thank you very much. It's a great program. No problem. Thank you. Thank you. Okay.

You want us up there now, chief? 1 second, I might kind of give a little overview what we did here first. Thank you for having us up here again. Looking forward to the big reveal here. Last year, we lost unexpectedly lost our k nine, Sparky Jackson. So after that happened, there was, of course, a lot of outpouring from the community. We were contacted by an individual who wishes to remain anonymous, but made a very generous donation of $10,000 to replace our dog. Which that went a long way. So we did. We went recently and selected that dog out at our location in Monmouth, Illinois. What's the name of creek? Cedar Creek. Cedar Creek kennels. So when we got this dog, one of the things we wanted to do was involve the community in the naming of this dog. So the idea was thought about. And I got to give credit to the deputy chief, Tim McLeod, and my executive assistant, Rhonda Schumacher, who came up with this idea, proposed it. I thought it was great. So we moved forward. So we worked with our community engagement officer, Sarah Hayden person, and we put out a press release. So starting from February 29 until March 6, we put out on the city's Facebook and the police department's Facebook. We asked for suggestions from the public for names for our canine. So over that period of time, we ended up collecting. There was 826 comments on the police department's Facebook. There was 296 comments on the city's Facebook, for a total of 1122 total comments. Likes between both were a total of 373 and 45 shares. But of all the names suggested, and some people would suggest multiple names in one post. So we had a total of 1313 names submitted. Now, several of those names were duplicates. When you eliminated the duplicates, we had 720 names. So from those 720 names, we reduced it down to ten. We submitted those ten names to all the department personnel. They voted and narrowed it down to three. And those three names are going to be. Finally, a single name was selected by officer Alex Bowman and his one lovely wife, Ashley, their daughters. They selected that name. So tonight we're going to reveal that name. So with that, if I. Merrick, if I could have you up. And actually, council members, if we could have you come up also. Alex, Ashley, come on up. They'll cover all us up, right? I know. I was hoping the dog was here. I thought I was coming. Was my hand shaking? I'm like, I was doing this. I was like, Leslie, you'll see that. I was like, oh, God, Kevin. Oh, good. Okay. Okay. And then I'm going to step right over here. Okay. Okay. And then, Officer Bowman, great picture up of our new dog, blue. Oh, I love it. Thank you very much. Have fun. Randy, will you grab my water? Coffee? Thank you. All right, next up, update. Rock island. Got a couple items. Show your irish spirit this Saturday. The 38th annual St. Patrick Society grand Parade is Saturday, March 16.

All those in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? All right, we're now back in the regular council meeting, and we got item 16 here. Anything new? Anybody like to talk about? Floor is yours. Floor's mine. Gee, thanks. I guess one item to bring up is that, as I mentioned, the last meeting, Tom Flaherty and I were out in Washington, DC with the contingency of business leaders and other elected officials advocating for legislative agenda that the quad cities had as a whole, along with what the city of Rock island had. I think we had some real good meetings, a lot of participation from the community leaders, great reception from the legislators on a number of issues. And so that was received quite well, actually. Wright is getting ready to convene and come home. I got a call from Congressman Eric Sorensen's office, and with one of the congressional. I call it earmarks. They don't call them earmarks anymore, but discretionary funding. I'll get the name right one of these times. But they granted the city of Rock Island a million and a half dollars for a road construction project in southwest Rock island. On 35th Avenue Southwest. Correct. 35th Street West. 35th street southwest for looking at maybe putting a roundabout out that direction or lifting and street or intersection reconstruction. Really bad out there. It's totally a $3 million project. We asked, requested for 3 million, got a million and a half. So public works and the city manager will work on the either more grant requests someplace or some funding to complete that, to get that project moving and help that out. But so we did get a million and a half out at that time. Since then, the Senate passed their bills last Friday, and we made a request of Senator Durbin a little while ago for some money to dredge the opening of the marina. The entrance to the marina asked for a million dollars for that Friday. That was granted. So we just received a million dollars from Senator Duckworth through Senator Durbin's office to be able to do that. So that'll be going through the Corps of Engineers. Not sure exact timing that that'll happen, but we've got a few things to tie up on our end and permitting, et cetera. But see if hopefully it happens early in the boating season here. But we'll have to wait and see where funding comes through with the corps and the permits. But some great news that will cover the cost of just that portion of it just covers the cost, just the portion of the, through the entrance to the marina. Where exactly they start outside the marina is yet they would determine that. We have some drawings someplace. It doesn't go all the way up to the channel, I don't believe, and it goes in a little ways into the marina, not far too close to the first part set of docks there. That covers the cost of getting the dredge. They put it on. We have a dredge pit in the back of the marina that they'll fill up and take it to. If we need more than that, then we'll ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Rock Island", "insights": [{"observation": "Resolution declaring opposition to the elimination of the 1% sales tax on grocery items.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Budget adjustment to the Parks and Recreation fund in the amount of $901,800.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Budget carryover from CY 23 and the TIF number six, the locks fund in the amount of $16,907 for CY 2024.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Request to install a handicap parking space in front of 23 one four 6th street.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Grant of $1.5 million for a road construction project in southwest Rock Island.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Grant of $1 million to dredge the entrance to the marina.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City of Rock Island", "insights": [{"observation": "Resolution declaring opposition to the elimination of the 1% sales tax on grocery items.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Budget adjustment to the Parks and Recreation fund in the amount of $901,800.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Budget carryover from CY 23 and the TIF number six, the locks fund in the amount of $16,907 for CY 2024.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Request to install a handicap parking space in front of 23 one four 6th street.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Grant of $1.5 million for a road construction project in southwest Rock Island.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Grant of $1 million to dredge the entrance to the marina.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1190956, "chunk_end_time": 1627216, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUsA_4hQbM", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUsA_4hQbM&t=1190s"}, {"start": 19000, "end": 25000, "text": "worth through Senator Durbin's office to be able to do that.

So those type of details yet to be determined, but, yes, it does pay for that part of it, which is probably the most key part. After that, we do have a request in for more money to be able to do the rest of the marina. Yet to be determined, and who knows if we get that or when it happens. But that'll make the boaters happy, correct? Correct. So we've had some great success in securing some federal funding for those type of projects that we normally may not have seen. I did have one thing. Residents are loving the tree removal. I know we signed, we passed that contract a couple of months ago. They've been, whoever the company is, is doing an excellent job coming out, and they're very efficient removing the trees and then removing the stumps. So it looks really good throughout the war.

Sorry to interrupt the conversation, but we all get waltz. So while they're doing all day, all day, and it's a beautiful day, we should have this outside. That'll be Monday for groundbreaking. We do it outside. So thank you, everyone, for being here. My name's Mike Tomes, mayor of Rock island. And I have the honor and privilege to open this up. But I know enough to be dangerous, as they say. So we have people here, city engineers, public works, boundary construction, that can help answer questions of devils of the detail, so to speak. But I just want to welcome everybody. Thank you for being here. We're so excited for this project to happen. There's no doubt about that. You know, it's going to be one of these stories. If you've ever remodeled your home or done some projects, there's a step. Sometimes you might think backwards to go too forward. And that's what I guess I view this as being during the construction. And they can answer how long that's going to be in wearing wheels. It's going to be a bit of a pain, but the end result is going to be outstanding. If people have seen some of the renderings, that things that are happening, it may not exactly be that way, but it's going to be close to it. We're going to have some fun, exciting things. We're going to have some boring parts, water and sewer. The public works love to talk about those things, but it's boring and it's ugly. But there's some exciting things above ground that are going to happen. A lot of new sidewalks and trees and plants and welcome signs and lighting, more pedestrian friendly lighting. Once again, I could go through a lot of different things, but it's going to be exciting and fun to see it come together by the end of this year, hopefully, if not first part of next year. And so we're really excited. It's a major investment by the city and the taxpayers investing in this. The money is coming from a lot of different areas. And maybe you've heard this, whether it be the tif money that we've had, federal ARpa monies that we have, citi, other fund, general funds. So it took to get this together. It took a lot of creative thinking, but also creative people to put together the ideas. And a lot of those ideas came back, believe it or not, back in 2015, when there was a plan done in the public here. And we just took that, polished it up a little bit, and came up with these ideas. And so we're really excited to have this kind of partnership and involvement with this. And this, I got to say, is the beginning. It's really the beginning. This is going to be, obviously, we only got so much to do and so many blocks that we can work on because of the money. But in the future years, the plan is to be able to take, whether it be a block at a time or an issue at a time, to be able to take care of a good majority of what people might now know as the SSA or special service area, the Rock Island alliance space that Jack is leading with the chamber for place making. But we want to continue to expand that. So everybody's place, a business and building gets touched, and that's the long term goal. Short term is we can only do so much, but we're just the city. I saw you say the council is enthused about this. I talked to a number of business owners and they also, it's exciting. It's the biggest investment that's happened in many, many years in this area. It's time that we reinvented ourselves a little bit and the city's making this step forth with the taxpayers money rose. But we also got to remember that the business owners and the building owners that we need to make sure that we get involvement from them in their properties. Also, public private partnerships are so important, and it's going to take everybody's involvement to continue this forward in the future and to be able to make this happen and to start filling those empty buildings. And so a lot of exciting things can happen and will happen in the near future if we all work together. So hopefully this sets a little bit of the pace. We'll get somebody up here that knows a little more of the details and can answer questions Jack followed. Thank you. Mayor Tomes set the tone, said a lot of great things.

So I want to give high level overview of the improvements we'll dig into more of the nitty gritty details that everybody is looking forward to getting before they leave today. So our three goals since day one for this project was to enhance public spaces, encourage private investment and improve overall quality life in the downtown for business owners, workers, residents, visitors, all of our stakeholders that we consider to be stakeholders in the downtown.

The northern part of this map is the first Avenue reconstruction project that will begin in 2025, reducing the traffic lanes on Great River Road or Illinois 92 to one lane in each direction with the left hand turn lane, making it more accessible between the riverfront park and the trail system in our downtown. So while it's not a part of this $8.7 million infrastructure investment, it is, as mayor said, this is the start and that is another exciting project on the horizon that will follow this one. This is an overview again of some of the project components. So we will see complete reconstruction of streets and sidewalks from building face to building face, replacement of utilities including water main, storm and sanitary sewer and streetscape improvements including streetlights, trees, benches, trash receptacles and the part I'm most excited about, the place making elements public art, lighting, gateway signage and an outdoor patio district supporting our established restaurants in the downtown that have been here prior to the pandemic, survived the pandemic and are continuing the in our downtown. This is the gateway arch that will be at the intersection of First Avenue and 18th street. So this view is looking as if you were at Shriver park looking into the downtown business district, welcoming welcoming visitors into the downtown. This is from the other side looking north. Here's an aerial overview of the really the core of the project area. Intersection of Second Avenue and 18th street. This is looking east at the intersection of Second Avenue and 18th street. You see the mini roundabout that we will believe enhance pedestrian and vehicle vehicle safety in the downtown as well as service. Kind of this central focal point symbolizing the true center, historical center of our downtown. This is a green lawn proposed, a mixed use space proposed at the intersection of Second Avenue and 18th street. It's currently a parking lot, and the public, our downtown alliance board and city council is excited about converting this into a flexible, mixed use space that could be used by the community. It's sort of the parking lot that exists today. One point that wasn't here, just to highlight it briefly, is Arts Alley, which is the 1700 block of Second Avenue that will be, as I said, completely renovated, including having one of the largest public art projects in the history of Rock island, too. And so that is something that we're working closely with Quad City arts and downtown stakeholders on. We've narrowed down to ten finalists who will be getting actual proposed designs for those murals in that space. There will be opportunities for the public to engage with those proposals here in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for that. And before I hand it off to Jason McKenzie with the instrument, Ken, on behalf of the downtown alliance, I will say one of our priorities during this project is to ensure, as the sign says and as the sign you saw coming into the, into the stern side, that businesses will remain open during construction. And I'm promising here we will work our hardest in partnership with the city to support businesses affected by this project. As the mayor said, there could be some time that are disruptive and challenging, but we will do our part to make sure that our community is helping by supporting you all and your businesses during this project, and that access will be maintained to your businesses, and in the end, we'll be better off for it. So thank you in advance for your patience, your collaboration, teamwork. That's what all these public private partnerships are about. Honored and privileged to be at the helm of that with all of our partners here. So thank you again. At this point, I'll pass it over to projects here. And Kim, senior project manager Jason McKenzie, thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Jack. As Jack said, we're here to communicate, communicate, communicate throughout the project. So there's going to be multi avenues of communication just kind of on site.

And Kim, senior project manager Jason McKenzie, thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Jack. As Jack said, we're here to communicate, communicate, communicate throughout the project. So there's going to be multi avenues of communication just kind of on site. Every once in a while, the contractor and my on site person will put out door hangers, like giving you some information, but then there will be on site personnel there that you can. That will be your first line of communication. And then there will also be a bi weekly newsletter that will be going out. And just a moment, we'll flip through that and show you like an example of that. On your one page that you have there, there's a QR code that you can scan and then sign up for that newsletter. Also, Jack has an email blast for everybody in the downtown, so he can, if there's something that needs communicated right away. He can blast that out to everybody. And then also on the city website and then also Facebook page will be updates. And then one last thing that was not on here, but we're gonna have a once a month business meeting that will get you all together and invite you all. And then it'll be the city and the consultant and the contractor, and we'll just get together and kind of go over where we're at in the progress and kind of an updated schedule once a month. So I was talking about on site personnel. Sorry about that. On site personnel. Here be your primary point of contact. Right here it'll be Luke town. Luke, why don't you stand up there? He's with. Beats your kid. He'll be on sign every day. And then Aaron Loveitz with Valley construction, they'll be outside every day. So they'll be your two main points of contact. If you have any issues right away, please get a hold of them. If you can't get ahold of them, call them or email them. And then if you can't get them, then please get ahold of me. Or Christy there. She's in my office. Or Mike Kane with the city or Jack Coleman with the downtown lines. So, so as I was telling you, here's a little newsletter that we'll be putting together every two weeks and sending that out. And basically what it is is it'll kind of be telling you exactly like what, where we're at in the stage of construction and then what's going to be happening in the next two weeks. And then there'll be a few pictures on there to kind of show you what is going on at that moment. And, like, there's the QR code if you guys want to sign up for that. So here's, here's how the project's going to be phased. There, in blue will be the first phase. So it'll be all of 18th street and all of Second street up to 19th, basically from 18th to 19th, and then from Third on Third street, from 18th to 19th, just short of intersections, the green area is the phase two. Those will be the intersections, basically second and 19th and second and third. And phase three is arts alley, which can be done at the same time as phase one or phase two, just depending on. Aaron will come talk about his schedule here in a minute. But a couple other things to kind of mention is typical. Working hours are Monday through Friday and occasionally Saturday. And then from seven to 330 will be the working hours mostly. But there will be over time. So the city allows the 07:00 p.m. so on their ordinance. So kind of during phase one, the red. The red dash kind of shows the circulation of basically of road, vehicle and pedestrian traffic through there. In just a moment, I'll show you. So during phase one, we're going to basically remove all the pavement and we're going to leave 5ft of sidewalk to get access to each building, which I'll show you in just a minute here. So here you can see this is basically from first it's first Avenue, Second Avenue on 18th street. The blue area will be what's going to be removed and then the orange area will be what's going to stay in place to allow access to the buildings and to the businesses. And then here it's showing basically 18th street from second to third showing the same. And then one thing is, once they construct all the pavement, like do all the underground, first they have to do the sanitary and the water main, and then after that in the storm sewer. But then once I get the pavement down in the middle, then they'll go to the outside and then start constructing the outside. And then pedestrian traffic will be through the street. And if the sidewalks are wider in that area, then it'll be the sidewalk. And then here shown on second, basically showing all the removal of the blue and then the orange will be what's going to be left for the phase. And then they'll basically flip flop over after they get the middle done. One thing to add is, so we'll work with you. You're probably asking how are we going to get your front door done? So there's some. A lot of businesses are out of off work on Mondays, so some aren't, but some are. Then they'll construct that and they'll work. And then here's second, here's phase two. They say it'll just be the intersections there and green have signage around it for access around it. And then just again, phase three is basically Arts alley. In Arts Alley, just let you know, like, same situation, they'll remove kind of the center and they'll leave like a five foot a", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Valley Construction", "insights": [{"observation": "On-site personnel from Valley Construction will be available every day for communication and support during the construction project.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Beats Your Kid", "insights": [{"observation": "On-site personnel Luke Town from Beats Your Kid will be available every day for communication and support during the construction project.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City-Contractor-Consultant Partnership", "insights": [{"observation": "Multiple communication avenues (door hangers, bi-weekly newsletter, email blasts, city website, Facebook updates, and monthly business meetings) will be employed to keep stakeholders informed.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Efforts to maintain access to businesses during construction work to mitigate disruption.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Typical working hours for the construction project are Monday through Friday and occasionally Saturday, from 7:00 to 3:30, with overtime permitted up until 7:00 PM.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Valley Construction", "insights": [{"observation": "On-site personnel from Valley Construction will be available every day for communication and support during the construction project.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Beats Your Kid", "insights": [{"observation": "On-site personnel Luke Town from Beats Your Kid will be available every day for communication and support during the construction project.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City-Contractor-Consultant Partnership", "insights": [{"observation": "Multiple communication avenues (door hangers, bi-weekly newsletter, email blasts, city website, Facebook updates, and monthly business meetings) will be employed to keep stakeholders informed.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Efforts to maintain access to businesses during construction work to mitigate disruption.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Typical working hours for the construction project are Monday through Friday and occasionally Saturday, from 7:00 to 3:30, with overtime permitted up until 7:00 PM.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 573810, "chunk_end_time": 1104154, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyviAM4h_s4", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyviAM4h_s4&t=573s"}, {"start": 14000, "end": 20000, "text": "hey'll go to the outside and then start constructing the outside.

And then after they get that kind of constructed in the inside, then they'll go back and remove the outside and then they give you access through that way. So here, this line right here is basically showing where all available parking will be during construction. And just, just in purple are the current available spots the city's working on, working with modern women and working out some leases on those peak parking areas. So they're not available right now, but we're working quickly to get those available. And as soon as that's available, we'll blast that out on the newsletter and then email and just let you know with an updated parking map. At this time, I want to turn it over to Aaron for Valley construction. He'll kind of go through the schedule. I just want to say one thing before he comes up is that. Just wanted to let you know that this is. We're going to be working in a really old part of town and we, we don't know if we know everything that's in the ground, but we're pretty sure we do. But you never know in the old part of town. So this is kind of Aaron's giving you the best case scenario schedule. So. But if we find something, we'll communicate that out to you and let you know if the schedule changes. And then also one other thing is that the schedule that he's kind of putting forth is kind of weather dependent. If we get like a real rainy season, you know, the schedule could change a little bit. So. But we'll make sure we communicate that with you and get that on the newsletter. And then once a month we'll update the schedule with the business owner here. I'll turn it over to Aaron. Well, thank you. First and foremost, we want to really thank the city of OCAD alliance. And this is. Yeah, can you hear me? Sorry, my voice is a little harsh. Well, six way to eight, huh? Check out the mic houses. All right, awesome. Well, first and foremost, we want to thank everyone. City, Rock Island, BK Streamline, downtown Alliance, as well as all the business owners and residents are here. And the first thing that I want to talk about here is what Valley wants to do is be as available as possible to make everything happen for the city and residents and businesses. With that being said, Jason Jack definitely had the easy part. Now it's up to me to make it a little bit feasible. So what that means is that we're going to start this project right away. What that's going to look like is basically next week we're going to start looking at tearing up the downtown area. We would see that after the groundbreaking, a lot of things happen really fast. So the one thing I want to offer to the business owners or residents and anyone else that has questions, you know, feel free to contact me. Feel free to contact anyone from BK, that team as well as the city. We're working here as a partner. We're definitely trying to advocate for communication. Number one. So after the groundbreaking, what it's going to look like is that we're going to start demoing concrete right away, starting getting the areas open, starting getting the underground stuff. The things that you're not going to see, because that's always a fun part for us, is that we gotta get everything. We gotta go from low to high. So what that's gonna look like is you're gonna see probably a couple months straight of just demolition machines working left and right, and you will not see any progress. But it's because of TSC. It's all out of there. What that really means for us is that, you know, if you have questions, be a part of what Jack is providing for you as far as the two big updates, and be a part of that one every month, business and resident meeting, be part of that, be informed. And again, if you have questions, feel free to come to me. Getting back to the schedule, what that's going to look like for everyone is that we're going to start here next week. And phase one is a large section of these project. You're going to see us out on phase one for probably most of the year, almost all the way to the end of October to November timeframe. At that point, once we get everything turned over and ready for everyone to drive on, then we're going to go into our phase two. Phase two is the two intersections that's been shown on 19th and second, 1930. The project will start seeing some transition into phase two. Probably around. Probably around the end of October, we'll start having some activities being done. There will be a small overlap between phase one and phase two, but that's only to be expected downtown project like this. So we would ask for everyone to work with us and understand that project schedule does fluctuate. You know, I can't control the weather, even though everyone thinks I can. You know, being as tall as I am, everyone asks for how the weather is up there. So at the end of the day, I try to do my best, but like Jason even alluded to a little bit here. This is downtown area. It's well over 100 years old.

It's well over 100 years old. You know, I think being a member of the past family here, we've been here for 100 years. You know, we're going to celebrate our 100 year next year, 2025. So we're really excited to be part of this job. And, you know, over 100 years, we don't have the same piece of equipment that we had. I think we started off with a horse drum bug or something like that, right, Greg? So things change over time, and we expect things to come up over. We expect things to come up over the course of the construction period. So please work with us. Please work with the team. Please work with. Rock on and understand that schedules do change. Schedule three or phase three, sorry, Arts Alley. That phase is going to be incorporated. We're going to be trying to get that project done this fiscal year so that we can get that turnover to the arts gallery and the arts, arts community as soon as possible. We're going to be working with the city in a muralist to coordinate our events so that we don't disrupt that activity. But once the muralist is complete progressive, try to have a crew in there and start making improvements to that alleyway. And then with the final completion of this project, what we're going to be looking at is we're going to have continuing activities until probably June 1 of 2025. A lot of what's going to be happening next year is the landscaping projects. And the ultimate hope here is that the roadway, all the harpsuries are restored back to the public by the end of this year. And again, this goes over to 18th street a little bit further. 18th street, is that the Dachru factory parking lot? We're hoping to have that restored 100% with all other landscaping items by June 1. So I know, on behalf of Valley construction, B and K, and the city of Rock island, we're all excited to get this project started. And I'll bring Jack and Jason back up here to help field any questions that there might be. I know that there's a couple more vendors, Jack, we wanted to go through those real quick. So Jason has a mic for any audience members to ask questions of the. The group, not just me. I can help you. A facilitator here. We have some additional renderings of the project that I can scroll through, but if anyone has a question, anytime, raise hand. Denny. Thank you. Yep. Jason's bringing a mic just so everybody can hear. I have a couple of questions. It sounds from what you were saying about the parking lot that's across from El patron and that's going to be used for other purposes. Now, will there be a net loss of parking spaces as a result of the project? So ultimately, what we're trying to do is work with the city on minimizing as much impact to the parking spots as possible. I know that, for instance, Jack, the city of Rock island has gone extensively looking for builds parking space. So you will ultimately lose some parking space on 18th, just due to the fact that construction is closed. But again, I think the team here has shown there's a wide variety of available areas as well as I think most recently the parking structure from the city of Rock island got completed, what? Last year. So hopefully that answers your ultimate question. And then I'm wondering if there has been money budgeted for the loss of business at downtown companies as a result of the project. It's a great question, Jenny. We are working with the city had some conversations this week about exploring possible funds to help with business interruption, essentially, or impacted businesses during the construction project. So we don't have anything concrete. Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm looking at my partners at the city here, but we are exploring it. So stay tuned and hopefully we'll be able to unlock some additional funds for that. Great question. The other piece on the parking, real quick, we looked at that lot really closely. There's about 20 spots in that lot. There's about 1000 plus parking spaces in the downtown on street parking as well as the city's lots. So there are plenty of places to park. We're going to gain parking spaces through the leases with modern women of America, which would be huge help. And so another shout out to modern women for helping us with that during this project. I have a question about really kind of the alleyways that access parking and really trash that are between Second Avenue and Third Avenue. So this would be around the Starcrest building behind the pancake house. That area, it would be accessed right next to the Pancake house. So that is the only way in to a 44 space parking lot is access on that road. And that is also where trash is for most of those buildings. So how will there be access to that trash?

And so another shout out to modern women for helping us with that during this project. I have a question about really kind of the alleyways that access parking and really trash that are between Second Avenue and Third Avenue. So this would be around the Starcrest building behind the pancake house. That area, it would be accessed right next to the Pancake house. So that is the only way in to a 44 space parking lot is access on that road. And that is also where trash is for most of those buildings. So how will there be access to that trash? How will trash be handled there? And then is there any accommodation for getting people in and out of that parking lot? I have federal partners that park there regularly. So that's been a discussion piece between the team here, B and Cave Valley and the city of Rock island. We're exploring the options to see what we can do to maximize as much support availability as we can. There will be portions of the construction project where we have to close it. And this is one of the things that we have to communicate with the businesses here, is understanding what requirements are. We don't know all the facets of everyone's business here, but hopefully through future communications, future meetings, talking to Jack, talking to the Rock city, we can try to minimize our impact and be as comedy as possible. But we also need to understand that this is a construction project and just the communication is the biggest piece I'll add to that, we're probably going to explore, because it'll be cut off on third, so if they construct 2nd first and then. So maybe we'll just be able to give you access through second. At that point, will the two streets be done separately? I guess that's another question. Well, there'll be portions that'll be done together, but, I mean, the paving or the concrete and stuff will be done separately. I have a related question. Sure. My understanding is there are no vehicles inside the blue area. No vehicles are allowed inside the blue area? That's correct. And that's for everyone's safety. We're going to be swinging 100,000 power machines around, trying to dig down ten to 15ft deep. And, you know, what we want to try to do is create a safe space, as well as trying to maximize as much work as we share. I understand that my question has to do with pedestrians who live. We're in Hessen lofts on First Avenue and 19th street and we have some residents in our building who are handicapped and I think it would be very difficult for them to even walk from the parking lot across 19th street to get into the building in uncertainty. If they have, I think that would be a big problem. So 19th and first, you said? Yes. So currently, that that intersection, that corner is going to be outside of the project limits. So that's going to be on the northeast corner where we are going to be doing some work on 19th and second, so they wouldn't have access to park their car on 19th Avenue and walk the entrance to the Belgium. As you see on that handout, that block is highlighted as available parking spaces. So, Mary, that block will not be reconstructed as part of this project. John Keim had his hand up as well. Don't see anybody. John Coim, original huckleberries, great beans and calzones. Excited about the project? Excited about the end of the project and what this will look like in the new field downtown. A couple of concerns I have is, when you take out the city street lighting at night, will there be any temporary lighting overnight for anybody that is coming around the buildings? We can discuss that with the city and the team here. And the reason why the street lighting is going to go down is for everyone's safety. We want to make sure everything gets done and we don't want to rip something up, have some live conduit, anything like that. So we will sort of that back with the team and then it might be another question we direct to or have a little blast off from Jack here as far as communication, what that resolution is. Okay. Maybe something temporary there. Okay. For the trash issue, that is a concern. A dumpster on maybe. I hate saying in front of my neighbors buildings, but 19th street, maybe out the street, a couple spots there for a community dumpster for a while would be helpful, accessible for all the businesses in that core. If I'm a property owner and I have water and sewer lines going out to the street and this street's getting torn, is this a good time for us to talk to maybe like our plumbers to see if we can do a new reconnect with new lights coming in out if we need it and with the city, allow us to work with the contractors? I would communicate with the city for sure. If there's any improvements that you may need. We are doing improvements ourselves from this roadway to the building phase. That's what I mean. And if something is involved, please coordinate that through public works, through VK, through valley, and make this as a known issue, because again, if we can coordinate and try to help you out as a business owner, we definitely want to have that as an available option. Okay, great. I look at that as a great opportunity. And then anything with parking after this is the street parking for like, let's say, 18th. Is that pretty much the same kind of parking that's going to be there? On the west side it'll be along the sidewalk, but on our east side, it'll be angled parking. I believe that it shows everybody pretty well. Jason, parking. Yeah. Yes. It'll be exactly the same parking that is today, dying on one side and parallel. And then your question about. So the water services and the actual sanitary services will be replaced up until the building or up until the curb box. Like if you see a curb box, like a foot or two from the building, they'll be replaced up to that point.

But it definitely is a good time if you want to replace it from inside the building out to that point. Sarah, Jason, right behind you. Ok. We have some questions about the reconstruction of the sewer in the water and just concerns on how long we'll be without water. We've got residential apartments as well as the restaurant. So I'm trying to understand if we will be, how long we'll be without water. Essentially, we'll be closed. So, Bobby, kind of add on to this, but so what they do is they get it all constructed, the new, and then they leave just the connections to the old. And so then the connections they'll try to schedule at a time, maybe, you know, there's some business that are, like, not there on Mondays. I mean, so they're going to schedule that in advance, like 48 hours, 72 hours. But there will be a couple outages on water, but they'll all be coordinated and they'll just be. You want to talk about that area? Absolutely. So, like Jason said, we're going to be constructing the new water main while keeping the old active. We're not going to shut down during the whole process of reconstruction. Our goal is that once we are ready to tie into your service, we will notify you as much as possible. And at that point, what we would look for is saying, these are my peak hours. These are my non peak hours. That's what we need back from them. Businesses and residents saying, hey, this is a time frame that I feel like I'm not going to be impacted when you make these connections, because without that information, again, I would just take a day and time, cut it off, you know, without any involvement with you guys, I can't make it the best transition. But I think, honestly, with the team here, you have a lot of avenues to communicate what needs to happen, when it needs to happen. And ultimately, going back to your question, it's not going to be a very long turnaround from when we asked for to be shut down to win it when you're back open. I would say at most, probably a day. So that's. Yeah, like, for the services, that won't be very long. Just a quick connection, quick over. But the main, like when the proposed main gets hooked into the. Into the existing main, it's a little complicated. So there will be a couple, you know, be a few hours at least for each connection, there's going to be a few connections. So, like Aaron said, it could be 4 hours, could be 8 hours somewhere next. But that's just one time, you know, but then this. No, I understand. Yes, I think. Yeah. Well, did someone answer that? Sorry, we can't hear the question up here. He wants to know, will it maintain a boil order for those two connections? So when we install water main, we are required to chlorinate the pipe and before it becomes active, we actually have the city rock test it with their chemists before it becomes active. But it's also a good practice just to make sure what you will smell is that the new water that's coming in after the tie in is done, it'll smell chlorine. But I would still recommend taking every precaution you can. It's just like any other standard, but I would say that if it is something that the product team, and as we go through this project, we will have that communication set forth prior to us actually making that switch. So again, anything that's required from owners or businesses or residents that I would expect door knockers, I would expect emails, I would expect clean communication on that before that happens. Had a little bit of a drive around on that on the 1800 block and Third Avenue earlier this year when there was some water main work done that the city managed. So I would assume that it would follow a somewhat similar process, obviously enhanced communication this time around. But we will work with you as closely as you want to work with us. So if it's a Monday Tuesday that you're preferring versus, say, a Thursday Friday Saturday, when it comes to the restaurant as an example, we're here to work with you on that. I don't need to bother everybody, but if someone could show me where our motor coaches will be able to park during this after we get down here, I'd appreciate that. That's on the corner of 19th street. It looks here as though there isn't a place that's close or to drop the people off. Denny, did you ask about parking spaces for your patrons? No. A place for the motor coaches to drop people off at the front of the theater, some of whom will be in wheelchairs, several Bahumo have canes or walkers. And so just how that will be accommodated. Thank you. I would say our best luck there is adjacent blocks, and so looking at the block directly east of circa 21 in front of the Fort Armstrong and working closely with them to see if we can get an arrangement to do that, that is only 30 minutes parking specifically for those similar kind of drop off approach. And so I would say we're have good luck working with them, hopefully. I know sometimes you do pull up buses that far one block east, is that correct? Yep. So I would say leading into that block and going further, farther", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Rock", "insights": [{"observation": "So the water services and the actual sanitary services will be replaced up until the building or up until the curb box.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There will be a couple outages on water, but they'll all be coordinated and they'll just be.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We are required to chlorinate the pipe and before it becomes active, we actually have the city rock test it with their chemists before it becomes active.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Anything that's required from owners or businesses or residents that I would expect door knockers, I would expect emails, I would expect clean communication on that before that happens.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Circa 21", "insights": [{"observation": "A place for the motor coaches to drop people off at the front of the theater, some of whom will be in wheelchairs, several Bahumo have canes or walkers.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City of Rock", "insights": [{"observation": "So the water services and the actual sanitary services will be replaced up until the building or up until the curb box.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There will be a couple outages on water, but they'll all be coordinated and they'll just be.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We are required to chlorinate the pipe and before it becomes active, we actually have the city rock test it with their chemists before it becomes active.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Anything that's required from owners or businesses or residents that I would expect door knockers, I would expect emails, I would expect clean communication on that before that happens.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Circa 21", "insights": [{"observation": "A place for the motor coaches to drop people off at the front of the theater, some of whom will be in wheelchairs, several Bahumo have canes or walkers.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 2162512, "chunk_end_time": 2595658, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyviAM4h_s4", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyviAM4h_s4&t=2162s"}, {"start": 34000, "end": 40000, "text": "oaches will be able to park during this after we get down here, I'd appreciate that.

So I would say leading into that block and going further, farther down east on Third Avenue, it's just off the map. So it's not that we can't touch those additional blocks, it's just not included on that map. So for drop off, I would say again, that block or the block that is southeast of your street level entrance. So that will be on 19th street, that will remain open until the intersection is under construction. And if there are certain days, for example, for the Wednesday matinees, you know, we have uniformed ambassadors that work in the downtown. If that's something that you want to talk about of needing some potential escorts for folks, we'd be happy to explore that too, if it is a little bit of a farther walk. We're happy to be creative and amenable during this process. So as far as 19th and third, we will probably not have that area removed within the next couple weeks. We're going to be methodical and try to attack each particular area little by little. You're talking about 3rd, 3rd Avenue, is that right? Yep. So during phase one, one of the things that we explored was trying to keep 19th street available for traffic. So what I would recommend is that as construction goes, you may see some of your sidewalk diminish over phase one. But if there is special requirement requirements, or if there's special conditions that might need to be considered, please let the city know and we can explore what might need to happen. But as far as your charter buses coming in and out of that area, I would recommend that they use 19th street as access and unload their passengers off of Third and 19th to get to circa total one. In your particular case, and as far as trying to keep that area open, again, a lot of it has to do with the phasing aspect. So our phasing in your particular case is beneficial because we have to end prior to getting into the intersection. So you may experience that your particular question might not be a concern at this moment. But again, feel free to communicate with the project team and talk about it over the duration of the project. Well, if there's no more questions, the project team will be around and feel free to come up and give us individual questions or maybe a question you forgot.

Nina, if you could put the presentation up, please, that would be very helpful. I'd like to just take a minute to introduce the team, basically for the ERP project. There we go. So obviously, city manager Todd Thompson has been involved with the software team. Samantha Gangey, she's been involved as well. City clerk Mike Bartel, Robin Bogus, Jessica Sager, Miles Brainerd and myself. And then early on in the process, we asked and obtained plant Moran for some assistance. So tonight we'll be hearing from Nina Rejevic and Adam Ben Mochi and Natalie Schwartz. They are here from plant Moran. So without further ado, I'll probably kick it off and hand it over to them. Nina's probably going to take you through the presentation. The objective of this presentation is really just to kind of give the council some background. So where we've been, what we've done for the last almost two years now, and where we think we are in preparation for later this evening. So with that, Nina, wonderful. Thank you so much and good evening, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We just have a couple slides to share with you to give you an update of the project, how we got to where we are today and what will be happening going forward. And so a little bit on the project background, some of you may have seen this a few months ago when we gave a presentation, but just wanted to reiterate why we did this project. The city had identified that there were some process efficiencies with the current system and some of the limitations that existed there, which caused shadow systems and workarounds and using spreadsheets and other tools outside of the main ERP. And that really staff wanted that desire and have that greater access to information and have better efficiencies from their processes. And so due to all of these reasons, the city embarked on this system selection for a new ERP with the objectives to get a more user friendly system and reduce some of that manual work and redundancy associated with the various systems being used. And so with that, and with this new project, we're hoping to incorporate best practices into the key business processes and provide both residents and staff to key information and to be able to access that from the system. And so that's where we are today with the main goal of this project is to procure an integrated solution, which you'll be hearing a little bit about where we landed with that in a few slides. So, in terms of the project timeline and what we've done to get to this decision, we conducted interviews with staff across the city and across departments back in April to identify some of the gaps with the current environment and what everyone wanted and needed in the future. And so as an outcome of that, we created an assessment report that we shared our observations and recommendations with the city. And from that we developed and distributed an RFP for a new ERP system. Then in the fall, we received vendor responses. We analyzed those responses, we brought the top vendors in for vendor demonstrations, which ultimately resulted in that final vendor selection, who we are going wrapping up contract negotiations with right now. Just to reiterate, the project scope was key. Financial areas, human resource process areas, community and economic development, and utility billing. So that was the main scope that we were looking at as we embarked on this system selection. And some of the themes that we heard from staff throughout this entire project was that they were really forthcoming and resourceful and forward thinking, and open to new ideas and excited for what's to come, and hoping to eliminate and reduce some of these paper based processes and workarounds that currently existed. And so these are just important things to keep in mind as we get into the next steps with implementation, to continue leveraging staff and their excitement and their institutional knowledge with this new system. So a couple of key outcomes from this entire project, you've already heard me mention a few of them with some of the software restrictions and redundant efforts that that's causing to date.

And some of the themes that we heard from staff throughout this entire project was that they were really forthcoming and resourceful and forward thinking, and open to new ideas and excited for what's to come, and hoping to eliminate and reduce some of these paper based processes and workarounds that currently existed. And so these are just important things to keep in mind as we get into the next steps with implementation, to continue leveraging staff and their excitement and their institutional knowledge with this new system. So a couple of key outcomes from this entire project, you've already heard me mention a few of them with some of the software restrictions and redundant efforts that that's causing to date. But with this new system, again, hoping to incorporate some of those best practices and reevaluate some of the processes to really streamline the business processes and the implementation. And so those were some of the findings and things that we identified through this entire project so far, which got us to our recommendations and outcomes from that assessment. And so through this engagement, we identified these three options for the path forward for the city. And so one of those was to keep with the status quo, remain on the current system, which is not viable long term. As you've heard, there's already some challenges that staff have been experiencing in workarounds. And so we had suggested that the city look for a new ERP or a new best of breed solution. Both of those would be great options for the city. And so based on that, the city had released that RFP back in August, considering options for both of these. And so whether that was one single system of record with integrated modules and having kind of everything in one place versus a best of breed integrated solution, those were the two options that we were open to when we release the RFP. And so based on that, the city received ten responses to the RFP for both of those options. And you can see here the different vendors that we heard back from and the scopes that they met. And so we'll share a little bit with you of which vendors move kind of into the next rounds and into this final selection here today. So with that, I'll turn it over to Natalie to share a little bit more detail about the selection itself and then Tim to give the recommendation. Thanks, Nina. Hello, everyone. Thanks for having us here this evening. It's been wonderful to work with the city and support Nina throughout the project. And I'm going to talk a little bit about the selection process that Nina already mentioned. In essence, our selection process is very much in line with a public sector procurement process where we elicit feedback from an RFP procurement process. We ensure that we have an evaluation criteria that's set forth, that really understands what the goals are of the organization. And that really was, as Nina mentioned, to cut down on redundant processes, be able to utilize technology to its full, fullest potential, and really include some of those modern functionality pieces into your new process. After the proposals were received, we went through a short list discussion and ensured that we looked at that criteria and kind of narrowed down from the many vendors that responded to identify the top vendors that we wanted to bring in and do additional due diligence. So there was a very thorough process to go through the shortlist exercise, as well as bring in the vendors, the selected shortlist vendors for demonstrations, follow up information, reference checks, and other due diligence that allowed the team to really get to the best fit solution and vendor for them. So here is the evaluation process. As I mentioned, there was three rounds for evaluation. So the first round was really did the vendors meet the minimum criteria? Have they done this before? Do they have a minimum client software installation? At least five that are similar to the city with the similar scope. And did they complete the proposal and submit on time? All of those vendors moved on to round two where we shortlisted, and you can see here the evaluation criteria broken up by the weighted functionality was 20% in round two. So that was the most important. One of the most important things to the city was finding a solution that best meet their needs from a functionality perspective. Service and support was also important at 12%. Investment in cost was very important at 40%. The technical components and requirements and how the vendors could meet their technical requirements was 20%. And then vendor viability, a perspective of what they were doing in the marketplace and how sustainable they have been in the past and will be in the future. You can then see for round three, after we went through the short list and we saw demos and reference checks and additional information through the due diligence process, the evaluation committee went through a final selection based on this criteria. And it's the same criteria, it's just weighted differently for the final vendor selection. You can see that there were a lot of vendor proposals received, that it really accounted for the approach that we went through with the RFP in terms of looking at the market for not only core ERP, but also best of breed solutions for some of the other best of breed niche areas. And we got really good vendor feedback through this process. And at the end of the day, there were two vendors that were shortlisted that went through the more due diligence process. And I will let Tim talk about our selected vendor. Thank you, Natalie. I was remiss in not introducing Gary a little earlier this evening, but tonight with us, we also have Gary Dubie.

And I will let Tim talk about our selected vendor. Thank you, Natalie. I was remiss in not introducing Gary a little earlier this evening, but tonight with us, we also have Gary Dubie. He's here to represent Tyler technologies. The reason that we have Gary here, of course, is if there's questions that this group can't answer, whether it's a team member or perhaps the consulting team, then we have the vendor here to address questions. But in the end, what we think is probably the best choice or the best option for the city of Rock island is to work with Tyler technologies. So, Gary, if you have any remarks you want to make, great. I apologize, I cut you off. You started to. No, I just want to say thank you for the opportunity to the city. And it was a very thorough process put in place by plant Moran, and the city did a strong evaluation and so we feel fortunate to have the opportunity to partner with the city. So, having said that, Nina, can you hit that next slide for me, please? I think. Is it. So, one of the things we tried to do was kind of take a look at the cost believe these charts were included in the packet as well as the recommendation. But one of the initial comments that Nina made was we considered the possibility of status quo. And so when you look at the red lines, those red pieces of the chart, this is what the city would spend over the next five years if we had the option to do nothing. Basically status quo. And even at that, we're still at one and a half million dollars that the city would spend over the next five years on ERP software. And so when you take a look at where we are in comparison to what's new, there really isn't a humongous difference between the two. Yes, it's $1.8 million, but really that's only $300,000 over what we would spend anyway. So the gap isn't that different. On the next slide, what I tried to do was taken a stab at how the city might go about paying for some of this software. In the initial phases, we were hopeful to utilize ARPA funding. And so you'll see these first three years tap into that source of funding, known as ARPA, with the final two years being probably solely reliant on a general fund. And short of the staffing additions that we talked about in the next slide, it will actually be less on years four and five than what we're paying currently. Total cost of ownership is a slide I'd like to talk about just a little bit. One of the things that I kind of do need to make sure that is clear to the council is there's more than just what we need to do with. With Tyler. And yes, with Tyler is a significant investment. We're talking about 1.61. But overall, there are more things to do. Right. We've got staffing concerns that we're going to have to wade through. We've got gis that we're going to have to wade through. And so there are a number of other little things that add into this entire total cost of ownership picture. And that's kind of what this chart is about, is showing the difference between here's what it really would cost, you know, from a total city perspective. The last slide is really just a direct comparison of what the total expense is. And you'll see that in the charts that were in the recommendation versus what the outlay to Tyler will be. And so I just kind of wanted to make sure that the council got a peek at the total cost of ownership with regards to our system, because there are other things besides this. Yes, this is all with Tyler, but no, there might be some other costs along the way that I just mentioned. Nina, do you want to go from there? Absolutely. Thanks, Tim. All right, so we're going to talk about next steps. So we were in the process, obviously, of finalizing the contract with Tyler technologies. We went through with Tyler, worked with them on reviewing and really absorbing the information in the statement of work, to the point where both parties are very comfortable. And we're excited to get started now with the implementation. Where the real fun begins, we like to say, because although there's been so much hard work from the city and from others throughout the process process to select the system, the implementation is when is when the real fun begins. It is. It's a long process. It takes a lot of effort and a lot of information right to get you through that implementation. And there's going to be kind of bumps and roads, bumps in the road through that process. But at the end, you will have gotten through it together, learned a lot, and really been able to achieve the goals that you really set forth in the beginning of the project, which was to be in a better spot to allow employees to do their jobs in a better efficient way and also use modern technology that will assist with that process. It's really important at this time, and I know we've been having some discussions on this already, to identify the level of support that you're going to be needed for implementation, both internally and externally, in terms of folks level of effort that they're going to need to spend on the implementation. This is going to obviously be a big lift on top of folks day to days. You're also trying to keep a city running and operating. And so pulling people away from their day to day for implementation is a hard, complex task to do.

And so pulling people away from their day to day for implementation is a hard, complex task to do. Many times we like to tell our clients to pull people into a room for a day or two and see how it goes. How can the city run without that? And do you need to backfill? Do you need to kind of adjust roles and responsibilities to ensure that you do have the right resources dedicated to implementation, but you can also keep city going and payroll going out. You are going to have to commit those quality resources to the project team. Now, there's a lot of resources that you can outsource, that you can get to help with a lot of the project activities. But at the end of the day, you're going to need your folks involved, engaged, bought into the project, trained up and familiar with the decisions that were made. Because when all of us consultants leave, you all are going to have to take that knowledge, the new process and the new system moving forward. And with that, with any digital transformation project, prioritizing change management, is key and really ensuring that you're infusing change management, you're planning for it, you're addressing it throughout the implementation is crucial. We work with a lot of clients that really prioritize this and others that don't at very similar types of projects. And it takes much longer for the system to be, and the process to be stabilized and for folks to adopt the system if change management is not a big component. So those are the key next steps that we recommend moving forward. We've talked a little bit about some of these, but really the major success factors that we want to ensure that we talk about today to kind of set the record straight for the implementation is to minimize modifications. And we talked a lot about this with Tyler. Tyler agrees. Gary, you can keep me honest that there is this standard future state process and future state configuration that you should be able to utilize out of the Munis solution. And so there really shouldn't be a need for modifications. If you do hear from the Tyler folks that this would be a modification, red flag should go up. There should be a governance structure in place where you have the executive folks sitting in a room and making decisions about whether that is really appropriate or needed. And we say that because modifications, especially in these cloud systems, are really not best practice, they can cause a lot of issues when you upgrade and they're just, they cause more headache than you need. So we really encourage you all to look at where you can make changes to your processes to be able to leverage the system out of the box. You obviously want to get executive buy in and build consensus around the ERP. This goes back to change management and getting that buy in from top down. And so we really want to ensure that we set up a governance structure and communicate, communicate, communicate and update people on the project. What are those quick wins? What are the benefits that they'll be able to realize and ensure that that's infused throughout the project? You want to set realistic expectations for the implementation. So although Munis is wonderful, it's not going to cure every pain point that we identified in the needs assessment. A lot of them will be policy changes or process changes or people changes, roles and responsibility changes. And so you want to set realistic expectations that it's not going to happen overnight. You're going to want to implement the system out of the box and make some changes, but you'll want to walk before you run, right? You'll want to get live and really get used to the new system and then start building more enhancements and also set expectations that again, it's not going to do everything for you. There's still going to be some things that need human intervention and even some reporting that you may need to do outside of what spits out of the system. We talked about staff resources stress this enough that all of our public sector clients that we work with struggle with this oftentimes, unfortunately resulting in delays and more money when you have to push, go live back. But you do want to really look at the resources that you have internally and plan accordingly for their availability and time for and bandwidth, and then kind of backfill the rest of those resources where you can. Establishing a strong project management is going to be crucial for the success of the project. There's going to be a lot going on and a lot of different phases going on in parallel, and there's going to be everyone in the city that is going to be impacted. And so really ensuring that you have clear communication and managing of the people on the project is crucial to stay on schedule and budget. And I've already talked about change management. That should. Should be a priority throughout. That's all we got. Thank you. Tim, would you go ahead and cover kind of the agenda items related to this?

So the agenda items just give an overview of what they're going to be asked to vote on. Essentially, there are three documents that, maybe four that we've attached to the agenda item, the first of which would be the pricing sheet, essentially, that Tyler has provided for the city to kind of give the numbers. The second is the statement of work, which is a pretty good explanation of how things are going to go. And then there's a third document. Help me out, Gary. What was that third document besides the statement of work and the. Is it the implementation? What was that third one? Oh, yeah, the investment summary, the contract and the statement of work. Ah, yes, the contract. Of course, that's the. That's where the real meat of it is. And the contract is basically the framework for the other two pieces as well. Included with the recommendation as well was some charts, basically outlining all of the expected costs throughout the project. One of the costs that the city will be faced with, obviously, is we're not going to make the switch overnight. And so for a time, we'll be running two systems. And when you're running two systems, there will be two costs. And so that's why you see some of the numbers being different when you look at those and scratch your head going, why? But that's essentially what you'll be asked to vote on, is we'd like to start working with Tyler Technologies and move forward with the ERP system. We originally budgeted about two and a quarter million for this project, and we're asking the council to approve 1.75 million tonight. The five year agreement with Tyler. As Tim noted, at some point the general fund will take over the charges related to that, but the initial implementation costs about 800,000 and then 219,000 per year for ongoing expenses, which the general fund will initially take over. As Tim noted, there'll be other expenses not related to this contract involved in the implementation, and then maybe just touch on the plant Moran item that's on the agenda as well. So as was pointed out, those first few steps are very important. And one of the things that we've had assistance from plant Moran throughout the selection process, and I'd really think it would be helpful for the city to have some outside influence in taking those first few steps. Now, do I expect necessarily that we need in depth project management throughout the entire process? Maybe not, but I do feel like these first few steps, especially with regards to the financial pieces, we really could use a little bit of outside assistance to kind of make sure we get off on the right foot. And they're able to bring in subject matter experts and sort of complement what the city's doing versus how Taylor does things and help us come to something in the middle, so to speak. And then finally maybe just talk a little bit about the schedule. So the schedule is tight, right. It's ultimately, we're trying to get it all put in over the course of the next two years. The first piece of it would be the financial components slated to start as early as next month. And so we'll start work on the financial pieces in April, and they are expected to function through probably next March. But once we are three or four months into the financial piece, there's an interest in bringing up the utility billing component, which specifically is intended for revenue management. And so that'll start shortly after things like cashiering and so forth. So that'll be kind of going on at the same time. Then when we get to the first of the year, we're probably going to try to get started with both community and economic development, which they refer to as civic serve as well as HR. And so we'll be talking about changes in payroll, we're talking about time tracking changes that'll be different, but at the same time, we'll be talking about modifications to how permits are being done, business licenses, all of that sort of stuff will begin to be implemented once we get into the first of the year, and so it is a multi year project. We're hoping that we can get it all done, quite honestly, in two years. It's a heavy lift. Questions from the console, or I have one and I don't touch on it. Others, I'll say software platforms that we have, public works or whatever that infect this, don't affect that. Are they compatible? Yes and no. So one of the most recent systems that we put in place was the cclick fix. There is a possibility that we may revisit that in time just because there are some overlap between what cclick Fix and what Tyler has to offer. And so we may try to find a way to bring those two worlds together. Public works uses gis extensively, and one of the things that we really need to do is kind of bolster our GIS system. So we've been working with another vendor to try and get our GIS environment stabilized. It isn't just public works, it's community and economic development city as a whole that utilizes it.

Are they compatible? Yes and no. So one of the most recent systems that we put in place was the cclick fix. There is a possibility that we may revisit that in time just because there are some overlap between what cclick Fix and what Tyler has to offer. And so we may try to find a way to bring those two worlds together. Public works uses gis extensively, and one of the things that we really need to do is kind of bolster our GIS system. So we've been working with another vendor to try and get our GIS environment stabilized. It isn't just public works, it's community and economic development city as a whole that utilizes it. And so that needs to be ironed out. And one of the things that public works does rely on, of course, is time tracking payroll like we all do. And so that's going to affect them, too, in the long term. So, you know, I just imagine it would. So is there, do we know where we have to customize compatibility so information can be transferred from one to the other, or is it something we may have to just run separately and manually put together, or abandon one, abandon the other and go into it, or. Well, you know, initially what we're planning on is converting some data from the existing system, certainly with financial data and hopefully from permits and business licenses as well. Yeah. And so there is a phase that we'll go through to try and pick up as much of that history, up to five years worth of history, and move it into the new system. So that'll be going on as well. Yeah, but I guess I was going back to using public works only as the example there. Whether there's other areas that I'm just not familiar with, that those software platforms will eventually be phased out and find one that's compatible with Taylor or. Or that the information can go from one to the other smoothly. Well, they've got a long list of partners. I know that Gary could probably elaborate better than I could. I know, in particular, we looked at the training pieces that Tyler had to offer, and so the city was already using something called Biz library, and I think we're going to continue with that. It's also true that we already use a recruiting module from a company called Neogov. And Neo Gov is probably going to have to be integrated into the Tyler platform. Moving ahead. Not necessarily replaced and so, but at the same time we're probably talking about eliminating govern, which is what we use now for business licenses, permits, that kind of stuff. Inspections, uses it for code enforcement. So that's going out. The cashiering, which is Inova, that's another piece that'll go out. Obviously gems, which is our HR payroll system right now, and the time tracking system from a tenant's enterprise will more than likely be replaced. The only other. What else am I missing? North Star. North Star. So yes, North Star will be phased out as well, which is another important component for utility billing. What else did I forget? That's fine. That's close enough. I'm just curious. Sometimes it's like a year and a half from down from now. It's kind of like, oh, by the way, we got to get rid of this software platform because it's not compatible with Taylor. We can't get information over to it or we're manually transferring, doing stuff. And so that's how. Just to know if we could avoid some of that or not. Well, I think we've tried as best we know how at this point. Right. You can't know everything. This is kind of a thing I've come to realize over the years. But you try to plan for as much as you can and it's going to be an interesting couple of years. The objective was to make sure that we are settled on this platform for a good five years. And after that we might talk about something different again. I don't know, but let's hope not because changing our financial software is. Oh yeah, no, no, I agree. It's not a thing we want to take life, but realistically there's always going to be changes. Natalie alluded to that too. There's going to be little bumps in the road that we stumble onto. Oh, we didn't know that. Sure. And so there is a little contingency built in to the project overall, but not a tremendous amount. So we have a little, just a little bit of wiggle room in there in case we stumble on or something like that. Mister Robinson, you want to say something? What is the percentage of this is going to be a lift and shift versus custom code with a lot of the old software and stuff that we currently have within our operation. It's all going so it's all going to be new code wow. So you mentioned, or I think Natalie mentioned about staff. Do we have the staff on hand to handle that? Or will, would that be shifted over to Tyler? As far as staffing component, we're going to come, have to come up with some sort of balancing act. I think the answer is no. We don't have anybody trained in Tyler today. As we move forward, the hope is we'll get trained in Tyler. But the reality is that, you know, without crying in my soup, there used to be eight of us in it, and now there's only five of us. And so we've made some changes over the last five, six, seven years that we just don't have extra brains anymore. And so there might need to be a little shoring up of staff as we move ahead. Yeah, that was going to be my next question about training. How is training? Has that been factored into all of this? It has. We talked about that in relatively good detail. There is a desire, I think, from Tyler's point of view, to do a train the trainer type of approach, and that will probably be the predominant approach. But at the same time, there are some things that. That may not work out well for, you know, when there's only one person that uses this piece or two people that uses this component. So we'll see how that goes. I know that approach. My job tries the same thing and it is a train wreck, unfortunately.

So we'll see how that goes. I know that approach. My job tries the same thing and it is a train wreck, unfortunately. I'm just being honest again, we're right in the middle of the same type of process where I just was sharing with Tim about one of the things we were doing last week at my job. So we're in the same process of doing the same type of thing. And my last question then is software. I mean, are we? I see software as a service is the platform we're going with. So I'm assuming that all of our data is going to be stored in a cloud base versus on site. So we're getting rid of all of our service, then we will phase them out over time. That's true. Okay. And one of the things that we sort of had anticipated, if we stayed status quo was we were going to have to replace some of the servers we were on anyway, especially things like Microsoft server, SQL, all of that stuff sort of underneath, as well as the unisys stuff. That kind of was in the middle for a while, and then you had gems on top of it. So it is possible that we are going to phase out a lot of servers over the course of the next two or three years. We won't have near what we used to have at least what we have now, which is probably around 50 or 60 boxes. So not all for that same thing. But in time we are going. So for like our police footage and everything, that's all cloud based now. Right now anyway. Some of it is and some of it isn't. So all of the body cameras, vehicle cameras, those all go up to the cloud, but we still have the fixed cameras, I call ones that are installed in buildings, intersections, that kind of stuff, those are all coming to the station and being recorded there. Okay, well, you know, I will get down in the weed. So I'll email you. I don't want to bore everyone with the technical things other than Robertson. I wanted to make sure I understood your first question. Did you ask if a lot of custom coding was going to need to be done? Yes. Yeah. So, no, that's not the case with this project at all. Yeah, well, we're not going to be doing any coding. No, not you, but Tyler will be doing coding. So what I mean by custom code is that work. So a lift and shift is you take the software that we currently have and you just plug it into what Tyler has, versus Tyler building something to accommodate that. Either they're building it from scratch, which we consider that as custom code because it's going to be kind of formatted to fit our environment or our needs. So we consider that custom code. Well, in our environment, we consider that custom code with that. That's what I mean by the training. Because eventually we either are going to be relying on Tyler to troubleshoot our issues or we're going to have staff on hand to troubleshoot those issues. I know a lot of it shops are going low code, no code, which they're doing. A lot of, you know, you know the terminology, it's going to be low code, no code. Okay. Yeah, I don't know the software. This is very much an off the shelf product. Yes, that's right. Yeah. So everyone says they will give you a package, and I'm not saying anything negative about Tyler, but they're going to give you a package. But what you will find out is sometimes what they present in that package is not going to be useful for you and you're going to need something custom. So this ensure that we at least we have that in our. In the back of our heads, everything off the shelf. We want to keep it as simple as possible. Yes, but sometimes there's going to be some things that are going to have to be custom. If it's a table, if it's a couple of tables. I have to talk to one another a certain way. You're not going to find that out of the box. And that was one of the issues. We found out we were presenting an out of the box option, which we should be able to do everything we needed to do. Once we dove in and actually got them on site and they started digging and through our code and our data, we had to customize a lot of stuff, so we had to backtrack. So that was kind of like my issues in the beginning, to ensure that we have an exit strategy. Because what we found out is once you get your code into these systems, it's hard to get it out. It's easy to go in with no code, low code. You're doing a totally different, you're not doing C sharp anymore, you're doing JavaScript. So it's totally different languages and it's a learning curve sometimes. Yeah. I think that the team specifically, I sort of went through the names of the team very, very first. We have met for months, basically. And one of the objectives that I kind of tried to get across was we're either going to have to adapt the software to us or we are going to have to change to the software. And predominantly the group is like, I think we're ready to change to meet what this software has to offer. And so we did have that discussion and it's, we're not going in with complete blinders on. They're aware of the fact that some changes on the horizon. But you're right, there's always a possibility that there will be some little thing off to the side and that's all, you know, that's always a risk. Right.

I definitely don't want to step on any toes. So nice job. Thank you. Any other questions by anybody? I hear any. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody on the other end. Thank you very much. All right. Thank you to the city. Thank you, Nina and Madeline. Thank you. Have a good day. Good night, guys. Thank you. Take care, too. Meister Bartells, you up first or next? I mean. Okay. All right. Well, good evening, city council. Thank you for allowing us again to present to the city council tonight to discuss the downtown project. As you all know, this is an update tonight to give you an update on the bids that we received and the revisions or the recommendations that were proposing to the council for the project moving forward. We received three bids for this project on February 15, and we opened bids on February 15, and we received three bids. And those were valley construction, Langman Construction, and McCarthy Construction. So between the bid opening on February 15 and now, the project team, standing or sitting next to me here, have been very busy working, going through this entire project. We had, obviously, a lot of bids. We've had a lot of alternates included in this project. So there's a lot of information to dissect and bring the best recommendations forward to the council that we feel will be the best investment for the city. And in the downtown, I mentioned the project team. So we have myself, we have Mike Kane, the city engineer, Jason McKenzie from BNK, the project manager. We have Jack Collin, the director from the downtown alliance, we have Andrew Dasso, the president of Streamline. And then we have Manzi. Yes. Yes. Sounds close enough, right? With streamline as well. So this is our project team. So the base bid. Oh, I'm sorry. We've had three project goals from the beginning on this project, and that was to enhance public spaces, encourage private investment, and improve the overall quality of life for downtown workers, business owners, and residents and visitors. So this is the project scope that we had. You can. I know some of these slides you've seen before. We've modified these with the information that we're presenting tonight. Can you all see what's in front of me on your computers? Okay. It's a little different. So. I'm sorry. I'm getting used to this here. So first Avenue, as we mentioned, will be starting construction in 2025. That's a IDOT project on being let this fall, and it's through service, transportation, block grants. So that that project is separate from this. The area in yellow and orange is what we call the base bid. That was originally the scope of the project to begin with and was really the focus of the project going along. We had several public comment or several public meetings and meetings with the council getting up to this point to where we went out for bids to have elements that the project like to see in the. The residents would like to see in the project. And so we've incorporated some of those. Those projects. These have come from downtown revitalization, revitalization plans, and other plans from. From the past here. So the alternates that I'm referring to are Arts alley cheek whiz. Sorry. Trying to. It's a little delayed, too. So Arts alley is an alternate. We had the outdoor lawn, lawn area, play area, then the green area there. That was a element that was added after we had our initial discussion as a result of public comment. And then the areas in Gray were also alternates, which was Third Avenue reconstruction from 17 to 18th street, the dog park and then the alley here next to the dog park. So the objectives again are with this project are a complete reconstruction of the streets and sidewalks from building face to building face. We're replacing all the utilities, water main, storm and sanitary sewers. We're making street escape improvements, including the streetlights, trees, benches and trash receptacles. We're also looking at place making to include public art lighting, gateway signage and outdoor patios. So what is being recommended with this project? So we're recommending the base bed be awarded, which is the reconstruction of Second Avenue Plaza to a festival street. 18th street reconstruction from first to Third Avenue and Third Avenue reconstruction from 18th to 19th street. This will include, as I said mentioned before, streetscaping, including trees, lighting, downtown gateway at First Avenue, gateway, columns, water, sewer and storm sewer. We're also recommending the art gallery revitalization that will include lighting, pavement murals, a vendor stall, new signage and an outdoor art gallery.

Again, we're also recommending the 18th Street Green space area, which is converting the existing parking lot to green space. New lighting will have the Rock island place making signage that we have shown in previous, previous presentations that we'll also show here in later slides. What is not being recommended is the reconstruction of Third Avenue from 17 to 18th street, which is known as alternate two, the dog park, which is alternate three out of reconstruction near the dog park, which is alternate four, and the WHBF tower lighting. So these next several slides that I'm showing you are elements that are being included in the basement and alternates. One of the most exciting features that I think are included in this project is the gateway structure here at 18th street and First Avenue. So as you can tell, we spoke about this before, but this includes the traffic signal being installed or included in this structure. It'll have a stone veneer. It'll be lighted on the columns. And again, the downtown Rock island welcome to with the established 1841 will all be illuminated as well. It's a two sided structure, so when you exit the downtown, you'll see the same thing on the other side. And we're tying in First Avenue with elements of this project as well of this structure. As I mentioned, this is the other side of the gateway structure looking towards Shreiber park. And again, it's a very beautiful structure welcoming residents into the downtown at business. So this is part of the base bed here. Again, just a big aerial view. What I don't want to give people false hope. So the project is really actually ending right here. This is also all existing and will remain this way. So our western limit of Second Avenue is stopping here. But again, it's including the roundabout. You see the outdoor lawn structure there, the new festival plaza, all new pavement, new lighting. Really, really big improvement to this area in the downtown. Just a closer look at Second Avenue intersection at 18th street. So we have the roundabout. We'll talk about some of the items that were removed a little bit further down in the presentation for cost savings. One of those areas that I'll go ahead and mention was we included roundabout lights here in this area. We eliminated those for project savings. There was several elements in this project to get the project within the funding limits to that we eliminated and we'll go into those further in the presentation. So this is one of the alternates that we're recommending acceptance on, which is the outdoor lawn at Second Aven 18th street. This is near the DAC fact parking lot currently. You see the food trucks along 18th street there. We're providing electrical outlets for connections for those food trucks if needed or wanted. We also have the outdoor lawn area, new lighting up above. We feel like this is an outdoor area for people to come in and sit as shown, for young kids to run around and play. That's not a paved surface. They can fall down and skin their knees if needed. But again, this is one of the alternates that was wanted by the residents and we felt very important to include it in the project. This is the Rock island logo place making sign that we feel will be a great element for this area. Pictures can be taken behind the sign. Again, it's just that place making element that we wanted to make sure that was included in this project. So this is the project. Looking at the eastern limit on Third Avenue and 19th street. You can see Pancake House there. So we're just showing again the what the project will look like again. New lighting, new reconstruction of the streets. You've seen these images before, elements of the design, elements of the project. So we looked at lighting space 50ft apart on alternating sides. It's currently now at 60ft tree and in ground planters spaced 50ft apart on alternating sides. And then we had the picture frame concrete for the sidewalks shown in the lower right corner there. And as the new parking ramp, we utilize that for the new parking lot. Area. So if you wanted to see what that looks like, the new parking lot area, the exterior sidewalk has that picture frame sidewalk currently. So I'm going to turn it over to Jack Gallina now for the Arts alley and the patio discussions. Fantastic. Good evening, council. Thanks for the opportunity again, know most of you, but for those tuning in, my name is Jack Cullen, executive director of the Rock Island Downtown alliance, and I'm really excited to present on behalf of the downtown alliance tonight. Prior to the establishment of the downtown alliance, we had the downtown Rock island steering committee dating back to April 2021, that has provided input on these improvements since that time, taking input from the 2015 downtown plan, input from the downtown steering committee, to where we are at now with the rebuild downtown committee of the Downtown alliance, as well as our full board of directors.

Thanks for the opportunity again, know most of you, but for those tuning in, my name is Jack Cullen, executive director of the Rock Island Downtown alliance, and I'm really excited to present on behalf of the downtown alliance tonight. Prior to the establishment of the downtown alliance, we had the downtown Rock island steering committee dating back to April 2021, that has provided input on these improvements since that time, taking input from the 2015 downtown plan, input from the downtown steering committee, to where we are at now with the rebuild downtown committee of the Downtown alliance, as well as our full board of directors. And so over the past month, since the bids were returned, we've worked with the committee and the board to come up with these proposals as well. And Mike touched on this. But I want to go back, just real brief on this overview. We initially didn't include the green lawn into the proposed, as part of the proposed recommendations, and it was our rebuild downtown committee, the downtown alliance, that came back at us and said, well, which is very smart and good comment. If we're improving everything around that space and we'll just maintain that older parking lot there, it will feel unfinished. And so that was indirect response to input from that committee. Again, just as an example, to show how we've worked with that committee of the board to get to this point. Now, it also aligns with feedback that we got from the community at one of our larger public input meetings during this process. Jack, sorry to interrupt. Can you share who serves on that committee? For my colleagues, yes. It's a five person committee of the downtown board. Amanda Wood of Russell Construction, who is representing the federal building. She also sits on our board. Erica Williams, who is a property owner and resident at Dumarche Condos. Greg Stecker, owner of Secker Graphics, property owner downtown. Pat Stolly, who is a registered contractor with the city of Rock island, he's a building owner downtown. And Laura Mon, who is the executive director of Nescafe. So a variety of perspectives, both from folks who have been involved in downtown for a long time or who've, whose families have been involved downtown for a long time, as well as those who are, you know, newer, if you will, whether they run an organization or own a business or some sort of an operation downtown. So thank you for that. Laura and Pat are not on the board. They're downtown stakeholders. The other three are on our full board of directors. So, moving on to Arts Alley, as you recall, and we'll get into the different funding sources of the project in a little bit. But this is a direct result of a state of Illinois tourism attraction and festivals grant that we help secure in partnership with the city. One of the most exciting pieces about this project are the large scale murals. The goal for these murals, and they are gigantic. I mean, combined, we have over 4000 wall space. And one of the goals with this, with the murals specifically, is to come up with something stylistically that doesn't exist anywhere else in the quad cities, really helping to create that tourism attraction. People coming here to look at those large scale murals done in Arts Alley and I guess one rewind as a reminder to folks who may be forgetting, but there used to be a building in this space and in the early nineties it was demolished. And as a form of infill development, Arts Alley was created. We believe this project is really taking it to that next step, to its fullest potential as an outdoor art gallery, social gathering place, special event, shared space in the downtown. We are working with Quad City Arts on the request for qualifications and getting to the point where we're actually selecting muralists. We had over 400 submissions from artists around the world for this, and so extremely exciting. We've narrowed down that list to just over 130 artists. And that is strictly based on qualifications and quality, based on the views from our partners at Quad City Arts. And so we'll be actively working with downtown stakeholders, with the building owners on both sides of Arts Alley, the Public Arts and Beautification Commission, as well as seeking opportunities for other ways to garner public input on finalizing the designs, what the actual murals will become in that space. So more to come there. Decorative string lighting throughout the alley. Opportunity for other smaller artworks in the frames along more kind of the street level. Part of the alleyway. New signage marking that this is Arts alley. Decorative concrete throughout the space. A vendor stall that can be used. Initially we had the idea of using it as part of a holiday shop up or pop up shop program where entrepreneurs, artists, businesses could come in and test the market as kind of part of a holiday program in Arts Alley and downtown Rock island. We initially had two in this part of the project, but as a cost saving piece, we cut it down to one. One of the exciting pieces about this structure is that it's a modular unit and so it actually can be repurposed into say, a pop up stage that can be used in a different part of the downtown. It's a temporary structure in Arts LA. So again, modular, designed as temporary, pop it up for a specific time of year when it's being programmed and it's actively being used. Say it's November, December during the holiday season, summer concert series on the new festival street. We could use that on the green lawn as a pop up stage, as an example that it can serve many different uses.

Something that is exciting to me, not, you can't see it in this rendering, but part of the proposed scope of the arts Alley project is to have a dumpster enclosure created on the north end of the alleyway, actually using some of modern women of America's property that they're willing to work with this on, on having a dumpster enclosure to remove the dumpsters from Arts Alley and hopefully some of those that are adjacent to Arts alley as well to clean up the space. If we're trying to make it a tourist attraction, not wanting to have the dumpsters in that space. This is an aerial. We have a holiday or Christmas tree at the south end of Arts Alley. Again, as another example of something, a way it could be programmed. You know, perhaps we do an annual Christmas tree lighting where the mayor fires up the Christmas tree and it's right there on the south end of Arts hall. Again, an example. The tree itself isn't as part of the proposed scope of work, but something that we could explore in the future. Outdoor patios. This has been, you know, the project is called the rebuild downtown. And the name of this grant we're getting from the state of Illinois is the rebuild downtowns and Main Streets grant program. Part of this is about continuing to recover from the pandemic and supporting businesses that were established prior to the pandemic, survived the economic hardships of that time and are still thriving. And one of the very tangible ways that we'd like to do that is through the additional of an outdoor patio district to not only enhance the streetscape, but really provide a way for businesses to expand their footprint out into the public realm, in addition, as another way to help market promote their business at the street level. So we've seen a lot of successful programs across the country during the pandemic up until now, and many are still being created just as we're proposing. This overview gives you an aerial map of where we would like to see the outdoor patio structures go. And so there are ten establishments that are on this map and the reason we have ten there as well. A number of businesses that offer dining throughout the downtown, but also have the infrastructure or the sidewalk that would allow these structures. And so, based off council input, following one of our last discussions, all of the patio structures are proposed for on the sidewalk. Nothing that is taking up parking spaces and carrying out or spilling out into the street. And so that was one of our priorities as we explored with the different vendors we were looking at, is to put these on the sidewalks in front of businesses, but as a way to help them expand their footprint. This is a bit smaller. You may see better images on your screen, but these are the specific specs that we put out in this bid package for the outdoor patio structures for the different restaurants based on what their store frontage is. We came up with different or custom designs in terms of the patio fencing for each of these establishments. So the idea with this is that, again, this is also a modular unit, modular fencing that we would be receiving assistance with to install for the first time. But moving forward would be a collaboration between the downtown alliance and Rock island public works to put these up. It's really a six month seasonal structure. We wouldn't want these to be out in the wintertime, you know, unless, of course, a business wants to make further investments into their structure. There's actually modular pieces that you can cover these to make it more of an indoor, more of an indoor structure during the winter months, but these would be to make clear bolted into the ground during the summer season or outdoor dining season, and then could be removed during the winter months. Businesses would be responsible for providing their own tables and chairs and can keep them out overnight through a simple lock cable. If there were concerns about people running through or running away with a chair or table, there, there are ways to prevent that from happening. But yes, we would be purchasing them, providing them for the restaurants. Restaurants would have an opportunity to further customize as well. In lieu of one of those wooden panels, a restaurant could purchase a custom made sign to fit into one of those panels for their business. To again enhance that marketing aspect. Planters and other decorative features can be added on as well. But we wanted to invest in the base infrastructure for this patio fencing to provide for the businesses. This is an example of it out on the street. The vision I like to give is, you know, it's a Saturday morning, 10:00 a.m. you're. You're wanting to go to the pancake house for brunch with your family, guaranteed at least a 45 minutes wait at that time of day on a Saturday. And so we envision folks taking a walk through the adjacent alleyway onto the festival street. There's outdoor dining structures. Perhaps there's a farmer's market.

And then you head back to brunch after that short stint and hit a couple of shops after that. But that's, again, kind of the vision that goes along with these improvements that we're putting in front of you tonight. And with that, I will hand it back to Mike Bartels. Correct? Or, excuse me. Jason McKenzie from Beansturn Kim. Thank you, counsel. Yeah, Jason McKenzie with Beanstreng Kim. I'm just gonna run through the numbers and talk through some of the items being moved for two future phases and a cost breakdown, and then just kind of, kind of summarize where we are in the schedule. So, as they alluded to, there's the $3 million, basically Illinois rebuild downtown grant. There'll be $3.9 million of ARPA funds in this project, 1.5 of the downtown, downtown TIF funds. And then basically, there's a grant for 267,000 for the Illinois tourism attraction grant for a total of 8.7 million. So this spreadsheet right here kind of goes through. We worked with downtown alliance committee, downtown alliance board, Rock island staff, and the project team to kind of go through these items being moved to future items. Two gateway columns, basically kind of in front of one, in front of circa, the one in QC Pancake house will be moved out of the project for 36,000, some planters for 11,000, the pop up stage for 25, the dumpster enclosure. Basically, we'll be having the one dumpster enclosure adjacent to Arts Alley, but we'll be eliminating the one that's basically between Second and Third Avenue and then 19th and 18th street in that alley right there. And then, as Mike Bartell has talked about, the roundabout lights will be eliminated out of there. That's not a safety issue. It was just kind of aesthetics, some aggregate base. We're just changing to a different spec. Got a little bit of savings there. And then also down the list there, the parklets. We basically took those out of the base bid for 192,000, and then just directly contracted with the vendor for 124. And then there, over in Arts Alley, we eliminated one vendor stall for 103,000. And then the postcard wall, 85,000. And then the green screen, 75,001. Thing to add is the murals cost that Jack was talking about is 102,000. So that'll be added into this into this contract. So this is all added in the 18th street lawn. We took away the play structures for 22,000. So we were able to cut out about 700,000 out of the base bid, alt one, and alt five out of there. Working with everybody. And also working with Valley construction, we went and talked with them, and these are the numbers that they confirmed for the cuts. And then, so for a revised bid of the base bid. Art Sally and then alt five, which is the 18th street lawn, there'd be a about seven, 7,757,650, 2000. And then as far as engineering, 500,000. Then also, we thought it was crucial to have a contingency in here because we'll be working in an older downtown area and there'll be some unforeseen things that come up. So we included a 5% contingency in there for any unforeseen items. So for a total of price of 8.7 million. And then, as we just talked about the last slide, the secure funds are 8.7. This is kind of a cost breakdown. Just to kind of show you what's going to be included in the project. There'll be five blocks of pavement and then there'll be five blocks of sidewalk being all reconstructed, four blocks of water. Water being reconstructed brand new, same with sanitary. And then storm, and then five blocks of new electrical with lighting, and then four blocks of landscaping and the, and the green lawn there. And then five blocks of furnishings and then some miscellaneous items there. So as we, we're here today at the council asking for approval, and then if we get approval, we'll move forward with a pre construction meeting with the contractor this week. And then we'll also then have a downturn. Downtown stakeholder meeting the following week to go over phasing and schedule. And then valley, talking about valley construction, they want to get started right away. So sounds like they'll probably get started the following Monday on the 8 April. And so construction will start about the 8 April at this time. Well, I just want to thank you for your time and open it up to any questions anyone might have. I have one. So just as I'm looking at the, the plaza area, the street there, I don't, I don't notice any lane markings down the center line. Markings? Are we not having any? I guess at first this is, these are just conceptual, so. Right. I'm just checking because every time that keeps popping up, I don't see them. I'm just making sure I'm in the, we're looking at. That's something we're doing. Correct. Down the plaza. Yeah, it's a. It's the city's choice. They. We could put them, or we don't have to put them. Just do this residential street. But we can. We can put. Mike, what's your thoughts on that? I mean, we have it. We probably should include them. Yes. Okay. Is that a. Okay, one more question real quick.

So just as I'm looking at the, the plaza area, the street there, I don't, I don't notice any lane markings down the center line. Markings? Are we not having any? I guess at first this is, these are just conceptual, so. Right. I'm just checking because every time that keeps popping up, I don't see them. I'm just making sure I'm in the, we're looking at. That's something we're doing. Correct. Down the plaza. Yeah, it's a. It's the city's choice. They. We could put them, or we don't have to put them. Just do this residential street. But we can. We can put. Mike, what's your thoughts on that? I mean, we have it. We probably should include them. Yes. Okay. Is that a. Okay, one more question real quick. Now, I know we've had a lot of things take place here, but so do. Are we using those? So say we have an event going on. Are we still going to be using some kind of a gate there? At the entrance? There'll be. There'll be removable bollards, basically on both sides of the plaza. And they can. They'll basically be. They'll be in there during the event, and they'll be able to take them out and they'll be flush during any other time. Okay. That's all anyone else have. Question? I do have one. So where the park is going. The green lawn and second and 18th. Does the city own that? Yes, we do. Okay. Yes, we do own the lawn. Okay. Just want to make sure. I have a question from miles. Even though he's not over there. He's over here. Miles, I had a constituent raise some concerns about our newly minted designation of our downtown on the National Register for Historic Places. It's going to be a bunch of new flashy lights, etcetera, with this project. Is there any concern from your perspective, that this will negatively impact our designation on the National Register for Historic Places? See, the great thing about being in this room is that I don't have to be up here. I can stay right here and talk to you. So. So those concerns have been raised before. And obviously, when you look at these renderings, you'll see a couple of things. One, the lights that we have been using, which have a more kind of historically sensitive design. Those are being continued throughout to try to be mindful of that. There are more modern looks that we could have gone for. This is probably something in the middle when you look at it holistically. As for the kind of long term health of the historic district, really, that's focused on the buildings themselves, not so much the streetscapes around them. So I wouldn't say there's any concerns. Okay, thank you. Mike, would you go ahead and talk about the agenda items related to this and kind of how the numbers. The numbers are in that approval item? All right. It's froze. There you go. Okay, great. Are you referring to more of the ARPA discussion? Yeah. But then also the nature of the, the approval item and what we're asking them to do related to letting us continue to value engineer it. The numbers are a little bit different. Sure. So we originally had 2.5 million of ARPA funds budgeted for this project. As mentioned, we've included 1.4 million of ARPA funds that were originally allocated for the Millstreet digester project. That project currently has expanded in scope. It's beyond what the 1.4 million would cover significantly. And so we're looking at other funding, funding options for that project. So it would not meet the timeline that is required by ARPA for construction. So we, the project came in over budget for water and sewer to begin with. So we've reallocated those funds for water and sewer and then some other qualified ARPA expenses as well. So that's where you see that increase. Again, we've included the contingency for the project at 5%, which is about $466,000 for the project. That's one of the other changes that wasn't originally planned for. And then we still have engineering and contract expenses. Expenses for once the construction begins, we'll have a full time construction inspector on the property project, inspecting the work that takes place, doing material testing, and we'll have construction layout as well. So that is some ongoing expenses that will still need to be paid for. So if there's any questions, the memo goes into it in pretty good depth. One thing to point out with the alternates, we included these alternates because of either public comment from our public meetings of wanting to see this, these items in it, or from Jack's meetings with the downtown alliance and workgroups. Just because they're not being included at this point in time doesn't mean that they want to be included in future phases. The nice thing about them being alternates, we have a exact price, at least at this point in time, of what the costs will be. We can plan for those moving forward. We can look at different funding sources for those, whether it be grants or, you know, cds spending, those type of options. And the work has already been designed, engineered, and ready to go out for bid. So we could take these plans for these alternates. And if the council wanted to allocate additional funding for these projects, say, next year or even, even this year, we could, we could put out the project within a week or two weeks time frame, change some dates on the current plans and put them out for bid. So that work has already been designed and ready to go, which is nice it's unfortunate that we can't move forward with all these elements, but again, it's not. We don't want to make sure. We want to make sure that the council's aware and everybody in the city that these projects can happen in the future should funding become available. I have a question.

We want to make sure that the council's aware and everybody in the city that these projects can happen in the future should funding become available. I have a question. Why was the decision made to do Third Avenue instead of just doing all of Second Avenue? So that was one of the items that I wanted to see included in the project. We have businesses along, along that area. It ties in the new parking lot that we just constructed and would tie in the rest of our construction. So it's kind of working our way into that. All the new improvements that we're talking about tonight. Again, we hoped that we would receive the project funding to be able to do that alternate, but we just came in over budget. My concern is just exactly what you said, but I take the opposite approach, that we have businesses currently there, so why not take an area that does not have businesses? I mean, there's way more open spaces on Second Avenue than on Third Avenue. So that was just my concern. Yeah, and that's. And Jack can kind of allude to that, too, but we have. Not necessarily about the business that you're pointing out, but wherever we go in the downtown, we're always going to have someone upset with where we're doing the work and where we're not, you know, again, we go, we touch back to the second avenue, the roundabout area as being the focal point of the downtown, expanding from there. These are future improvements, improvements that, again, like, if we have funding to do that street, that would be one of the areas that I would recommend moving forward with right away. But it just. You don't have the funding. And Mike Kane is our historian on this, but I've been saying he's old and that's out of, out of full respect. But the, the 1700 block of Second Avenue and the 1600 block of Second Avenue were redone more recently, I believe. Yep. But why not? Why not doing all of second? So I think that was also part of, you know, the reasoning going in behind that, too, is that it's newer infrastructure on those two adjacent blocks. They already have, like the pedestrian scale street lighting as an example. But hopefully, this serves as a great framework for going block by block in the future. Now that we have these design guidelines, we know the type of sidewalk panels that we want, the types of street lighting, the diversity in tree species, things of that nature. Hopefully it sets us up for success for going block by block in the coming years as funding allows. I just got a quick question about the lighting on the, on the lawn. I understand we're going into costs a little bit, so I don't know what the cost is for the rope lights on the green lawn. Have we thought about doing this like a pole since. Because since that whole. That whole area has kind of changed. We took the playground equipment out, we kind of took the stage out. I don't know what kind of programming we're looking out there. I know Jack said something about we could do a pop up stage or something like that, but have we thought about changing the design of those lights just so it's not just like we threw rope lights all over the downtown area. We haven't thought about changing the way the lighting is laid out currently, as shown. We have pricing to make those modifications ahead of time should the council want. Want to make those changes. I believe it's just a linear foot for the string lighting, so we know exactly what the cost is per foot. And then each light pole or light pole, we have each price for those as well. So if you wanted to remove the string lighting, add in some vertical pole lighting, we could do that and give you those costs. Gotcha. We would just need to know that obviously here in the next month or two. Jack, real quick, for Arts Alley, are we uplighting the murals? I think in the presentation it looked like we had some uplighting on that. I don't know if that's in this. We don't have a component for uplighting in this proposed scope. Correct me if I'm wrong. Do we? No, we do not. This is, though, something that we've had preliminary conversations with, about, with the building owners. Not specifically around uplighting these murals, but uplighting those buildings in general. And one of the property owners has brought it up as something that they would potentially be interested in. So not in the proposed scope, but perhaps it's something that we could work through as a, you know, a secondary phase. I guess I'm just looking at the aesthetics. If it's at night, I think that will be. That will just make that area pop. Yep. If you have the rope lights, it's kind of. Someone's gonna shadow it where you can't see the murals at night. And that will help enhance it a little bit to kind of bring that area into, you know, more of a festive vibe or whatever, but you can highlight it some. Some way. Just some thoughts? No, that's a great, great input, and I appreciate the comment about the green lawn lighting as well. Not sure if on the market there are opportunities with the string lights to help do any sort of uplighting, but something that we can explore. So you could put them on the roof and get rid of the poles attaching to private property and that sort of thing.

It's pretty high up. Great input. One of the pieces, and it was brought up by Alderman Parker, one of the concerns, I think, that was potentially there from the state historic preservation office was around affecting any residents in buildings.

And so let's say that's one of the constraints, you know, with the lighting component. The other piece they don't show there. It's windows. Yeah. Now that's. I mean, that was their initial concern.

Nina's probably going to take you through the presentation. The objective of this presentation is really just to kind of give the council some background. So where we've been, what we've done for the last almost two years now, and where we think we are in preparation for later this evening. So with that, Nina, wonderful. Thank you so much and good evening, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We just have a couple slides to share with you to give you an update of the project, how we got to where we are today and what will be happening going forward. And so a little bit on the project background, some of you may have seen this a few months ago when we gave a presentation, but just wanted to reiterate why we did this project. The city had identified that there were some process efficiencies with the current system and some of the limitations that existed there, which caused shadow systems and workarounds and using spreadsheets and other tools outside of the main ERP. And that really staff wanted that desire and have that greater access to information and have better efficiencies from their processes. And so due to all of these reasons, the city embarked on this system selection for a new ERP with the objectives to get a more user friendly system and reduce some of that manual work and redundancy associated with the various systems being used. And so with that, and with this new project, we're hoping to incorporate best practices into the key business processes and provide both residents and staff to key information and to be able to access that from the system. And so that's where we are today with the main goal of this project is to procure an integrated solution, which you'll be hearing a little bit about where we landed with that in a few slides. So, in terms of the project timeline and what we've done to get to this decision, we conducted interviews with staff across the city and across departments back in April to identify some of the gaps with the current environment and what everyone wanted and needed in the future. And so as an outcome of that, we created an assessment report that we shared our observations and recommendations with the city. And from that we developed and distributed an RFP for a new ERP system. Then in the fall, we received vendor responses. We analyzed those responses, we brought the top vendors in for vendor demonstrations, which ultimately resulted in that final vendor selection, who we are going wrapping up contract negotiations with right now. Just to reiterate, the project scope was key. Financial areas, human resource process areas, community and economic development, and utility billing. So that was the main scope that we were looking at as we embarked on this system selection. And some of the themes that we heard from staff throughout this entire project was that they were really forthcoming and resourceful and forward thinking, and open to new ideas and excited for what's to come, and hoping to eliminate and reduce some of these paper based processes and workarounds that currently existed. And so these are just important things to keep in mind as we get into the next steps with implementation, to continue leveraging staff and their excitement and their institutional knowledge with this new system. So a couple of key outcomes from this entire project, you've already heard me mention a few of them with some of the software restrictions and redundant efforts that that's causing to date. But with this new system, again, hoping to incorporate some of those best practices and reevaluate some of the processes to really streamline the business processes and the implementation.

But with this new system, again, hoping to incorporate some of those best practices and reevaluate some of the processes to really streamline the business processes and the implementation. And so those were some of the findings and things that we identified through this entire project so far, which got us to our recommendations and outcomes from that assessment. And so through this engagement, we identified these three options for the path forward for the city. And so one of those was to keep with the status quo, remain on the current system, which is not viable long term. As you've heard, there's already some challenges that staff have been experiencing in workarounds. And so we had suggested that the city look for a new ERP or a new best of breed solution. Both of those would be great options for the city. And so based on that, the city had released that RFP back in August, considering options for both of these. And so whether that was one single system of record with integrated modules and having kind of everything in one place versus a best of breed integrated solution, those were the two options that we were open to when we release the RFP. And so based on that, the city received ten responses to the RFP for both of those options. And you can see here the different vendors that we heard back from and the scopes that they met. And so we'll share a little bit with you of which vendors move kind of into the next rounds and into this final selection here today. So with that, I'll turn it over to Natalie to share a little bit more detail about the selection itself and then Tim to give the recommendation. Thanks, Nina. Hello, everyone. Thanks for having us here this evening. It's been wonderful to work with the city and support Nina throughout the project. And I'm going to talk a little bit about the selection process that Nina already mentioned. In essence, our selection process is very much in line with a public sector procurement process where we elicit feedback from an RFP procurement process. We ensure that we have an evaluation criteria that's set forth, that really understands what the goals are of the organization. And that really was, as Nina mentioned, to cut down on redundant processes, be able to utilize technology to its full, fullest potential, and really include some of those modern functionality pieces into your new process. After the proposals were received, we went through a short list discussion and ensured that we looked at that criteria and kind of narrowed down from the many vendors that responded to identify the top vendors that we wanted to bring in and do additional due diligence. So there was a very thorough process to go through the shortlist exercise, as well as bring in the vendors, the selected shortlist vendors for demonstrations, follow up information, reference checks, and other due diligence that allowed the team to really get to the best fit solution and vendor for them. So here is the evaluation process. As I mentioned, there was three rounds for evaluation. So the first round was really did the vendors meet the minimum criteria? Have they done this before? Do they have a minimum client software installation? At least five that are similar to the city with the similar scope. And did they complete the proposal and submit on time? All of those vendors moved on to round two where we shortlisted, and you can see here the evaluation criteria broken up by the weighted functionality was 20% in round two. So that was the most important. One of the most important things to the city was finding a solution that best meet their needs from a functionality perspective. Service and support was also important at 12%. Investment in cost was very important at 40%. The technical components and requirements and how the vendors could meet their technical requirements was 20%. And then vendor viability, a perspective of what they were doing in the marketplace and how sustainable they have been in the past and will be in the future. You can then see for round three, after we went through the short list and we saw demos and reference checks and additional information through the due diligence process, the evaluation committee went through a final selection based on this criteria. And it's the same criteria, it's just weighted differently for the final vendor selection. You can see that there were a lot of vendor proposals received, that it really accounted for the approach that we went through with the RFP in terms of looking at the market for not only core ERP, but also best of breed solutions for some of the other best of breed niche areas. And we got really good vendor feedback through this process. And at the end of the day, there were two vendors that were shortlisted that went through the more due diligence process.

And it's the same criteria, it's just weighted differently for the final vendor selection. You can see that there were a lot of vendor proposals received, that it really accounted for the approach that we went through with the RFP in terms of looking at the market for not only core ERP, but also best of breed solutions for some of the other best of breed niche areas. And we got really good vendor feedback through this process. And at the end of the day, there were two vendors that were shortlisted that went through the more due diligence process. And I will let Tim talk about our selected vendor. Thank you, Natalie. I was remiss in not introducing Gary a little earlier this evening, but tonight with us, we also have Gary Dubie. He's here to represent Tyler technologies. The reason that we have Gary here, of course, is if there's questions that this group can't answer, whether it's a team member or perhaps the consulting team, then we have the vendor here to address questions. But in the end, what we think is probably the best choice or the best option for the city of Rock island is to work with Tyler technologies. So, Gary, if you have any remarks you want to make, great. I apologize, I cut you off. You started to. No, I just want to say thank you for the opportunity to the city. And it was a very thorough process put in place by plant Moran, and the city did a strong evaluation and so we feel fortunate to have the opportunity to partner with the city. So, having said that, Nina, can you hit that next slide for me, please? I think. Is it. So, one of the things we tried to do was kind of take a look at the cost believe these charts were included in the packet as well as the recommendation. But one of the initial comments that Nina made was we considered the possibility of status quo. And so when you look at the red lines, those red pieces of the chart, this is what the city would spend over the next five years if we had the option to do nothing. Basically status quo. And even at that, we're still at one and a half million dollars that the city would spend over the next five years on ERP software. And so when you take a look at where we are in comparison to what's new, there really isn't a humongous difference between the two. Yes, it's $1.8 million, but really that's only $300,000 over what we would spend anyway. So the gap isn't that different. On the next slide, what I tried to do was taken a stab at how the city might go about paying for some of this software. In the initial phases, we were hopeful to utilize ARPA funding. And so you'll see these first three years tap into that source of funding, known as ARPA, with the final two years being probably solely reliant on a general fund. And short of the staffing additions that we talked about in the next slide, it will actually be less on years four and five than what we're paying currently. Total cost of ownership is a slide I'd like to talk about just a little bit. One of the things that I kind of do need to make sure that is clear to the council is there's more than just what we need to do with. With Tyler. And yes, with Tyler is a significant investment. We're talking about 1.61. But overall, there are more things to do. Right. We've got staffing concerns that we're going to have to wade through. We've got gis that we're going to have to wade through. And so there are a number of other little things that add into this entire total cost of ownership picture. And that's kind of what this chart is about, is showing the difference between here's what it really would cost, you know, from a total city perspective. The last slide is really just a direct comparison of what the total expense is. And you'll see that in the charts that were in the recommendation versus what the outlay to Tyler will be. And so I just kind of wanted to make sure that the council got a peek at the total cost of ownership with regards to our system, because there are other things besides this. Yes, this is all with Tyler, but no, there might be some other costs along the way that I just mentioned. Nina, do you want to go from there? Absolutely. Thanks, Tim. All right, so we're going to talk about next steps. So we were in the process, obviously, of finalizing the contract with Tyler technologies. We went through with Tyler, worked with them on reviewing and really absorbing the information in the statement of work, to the point where both parties are very comfortable. And we're excited to get started now with the implementation. Where the real fun begins, we like to say, because although there's been so much hard work from the city and from others throughout the process process to select the system, the implementation is when is when the real fun begins. It is. It's a long process. It takes a lot of effort and a lot of information right to get you through that implementation. And there's going to be kind of bumps and roads, bumps in the road through that process. But at the end, you will have gotten through it together, learned a lot, and really been able to achieve the goals that you really set forth in the beginning of the project, which was to be in a better spot to allow employees to do their jobs in a better efficient way and also use modern technology that will assist with that process. It's really important at this time, and I know we've been having some discussions on this already, to identify the level of support that you're going to be needed for implementation, both internally and externally, in terms of folks level of effort that they're going to need to spend on the implementation. This is going to obviously be a big lift on top of folks day to days. You're also trying to keep a city running and operating. And so pulling people away from their day to day for implementation is a hard, complex task to do.

And so pulling people away from their day to day for implementation is a hard, complex task to do. Many times we like to tell our clients to pull people into a room for a day or two and see how it goes. How can the city run without that? And do you need to backfill? Do you need to kind of adjust roles and responsibilities to ensure that you do have the right resources dedicated to implementation, but you can also keep city going and payroll going out. You are going to have to commit those quality resources to the project team. Now, there's a lot of resources that you can outsource, that you can get to help with a lot of the project activities. But at the end of the day, you're going to need your folks involved, engaged, bought into the project, trained up and familiar with the decisions that were made. Because when all of us consultants leave, you all are going to have to take that knowledge, the new process and the new system moving forward. And with that, with any digital transformation project, prioritizing change management, is key and really ensuring that you're infusing change management, you're planning for it, you're addressing it throughout the implementation is crucial. We work with a lot of clients that really prioritize this and others that don't at very similar types of projects. And it takes much longer for the system to be, and the process to be stabilized and for folks to adopt the system if change management is not a big component. So those are the key next steps that we recommend moving forward. We've talked a little bit about some of these, but really the major success factors that we want to ensure that we talk about today to kind of set the record straight for the implementation is to minimize modifications. And we talked a lot about this with Tyler. Tyler agrees. Gary, you can keep me honest that there is this standard future state process and future state configuration that you should be able to utilize out of the Munis solution. And so there really shouldn't be a need for modifications. If you do hear from the Tyler folks that this would be a modification, red flag should go up. There should be a governance structure in place where you have the executive folks sitting in a room and making decisions about whether that is really appropriate or needed. And we say that because modifications, especially in these cloud systems, are really not best practice, they can cause a lot of issues when you upgrade and they're just, they cause more headache than you need. So we really encourage you all to look at where you can make changes to your processes to be able to leverage the system out of the box. You obviously want to get executive buy in and build consensus around the ERP. This goes back to change management and getting that buy in from top down. And so we really want to ensure that we set up a governance structure and communicate, communicate, communicate and update people on the project. What are those quick wins? What are the benefits that they'll be able to realize and ensure that that's infused throughout the project? You want to set realistic expectations for the implementation. So although Munis is wonderful, it's not going to cure every pain point that we identified in the needs assessment. A lot of them will be policy changes or process changes or people changes, roles and responsibility changes. And so you want to set realistic expectations that it's not going to happen overnight. You're going to want to implement the system out of the box and make some changes, but you'll want to walk before you run, right? You'll want to get live and really get used to the new system and then start building more enhancements and also set expectations that again, it's not going to do everything for you. There's still going to be some things that need human intervention and even some reporting that you may need to do outside of what spits out of the system. We talked about staff resources stress this enough that all of our public sector clients that we work with struggle with this oftentimes, unfortunately resulting in delays and more money when you have to push, go live back. But you do want to really look at the resources that you have internally and plan accordingly for their availability and time for and bandwidth, and then kind of backfill the rest of those resources where you can. Establishing a strong project management is going to be crucial for the success of the project. There's going to be a lot going on and a lot of different phases going on in parallel, and there's going to be everyone in the city that is going to be impacted. And so really ensuring that you have clear communication and managing of the people on the project is crucial to stay on schedule and budget. And I've already talked about change management. That should. Should be a priority throughout. That's all we got. Thank you. Tim, would you go ahead and cover kind of the agenda items related to this?

So the agenda items just give an overview of what they're going to be asked to vote on. Essentially, there are three documents that, maybe four that we've attached to the agenda item, the first of which would be the pricing sheet, essentially, that Tyler has provided for the city to kind of give the numbers. The second is the statement of work, which is a pretty good explanation of how things are going to go. And then there's a third document. Help me out, Gary. What was that third document besides the statement of work and the. Is it the implementation? What was that third one? Oh, yeah, the investment summary, the contract and the statement of work. Ah, yes, the contract. Of course, that's the. That's where the real meat of it is. And the contract is basically the framework for the other two pieces as well. Included with the recommendation as well was some charts, basically outlining all of the expected costs throughout the project. One of the costs that the city will be faced with, obviously, is we're not going to make the switch overnight. And so for a time, we'll be running two systems. And when you're running two systems, there will be two costs. And so that's why you see some of the numbers being different when you look at those and scratch your head going, why? But that's essentially what you'll be asked to vote on, is we'd like to start working with Tyler Technologies and move forward with the ERP system. We originally budgeted about two and a quarter million for this project, and we're asking the council to approve 1.75 million tonight. The five year agreement with Tyler. As Tim noted, at some point the general fund will take over the charges related to that, but the initial implementation costs about 800,000 and then 219,000 per year for ongoing expenses, which the general fund will initially take over. As Tim noted, there'll be other expenses not related to this contract involved in the implementation, and then maybe just touch on the plant Moran item that's on the agenda as well. So as was pointed out, those first few steps are very important. And one of the things that we've had assistance from plant Moran throughout the selection process, and I'd really think it would be helpful for the city to have some outside influence in taking those first few steps. Now, do I expect necessarily that we need in depth project management throughout the entire process? Maybe not, but I do feel like these first few steps, especially with regards to the financial pieces, we really could use a little bit of outside assistance to kind of make sure we get off on the right foot. And they're able to bring in subject matter experts and sort of complement what the city's doing versus how Taylor does things and help us come to something in the middle, so to speak. And then finally maybe just talk a little bit about the schedule. So the schedule is tight, right. It's ultimately, we're trying to get it all put in over the course of the next two years. The first piece of it would be the financial components slated to start as early as next month. And so we'll start work on the financial pieces in April, and they are expected to function through probably next March. But once we are three or four months into the financial piece, there's an interest in bringing up the utility billing component, which specifically is intended for revenue management. And so that'll start shortly after things like cashiering and so forth. So that'll be kind of going on at the same time. Then when we get to the first of the year, we're probably going to try to get started with both community and economic development, which they refer to as civic serve as well as HR. And so we'll be talking about changes in payroll, we're talking about time tracking changes that'll be different, but at the same time, we'll be talking about modifications to how permits are being done, business licenses, all of that sort of stuff will begin to be implemented once we get into the first of the year, and so it is a multi year project. We're hoping that we can get it all done, quite honestly, in two years. It's a heavy lift. Questions from the console, or I have one and I don't touch on it. Others, I'll say software platforms that we have, public works or whatever that infect this, don't affect that. Are they compatible? Yes and no. So one of the most recent systems that we put in place was the cclick fix. There is a possibility that we may revisit that in time just because there are some overlap between what cclick Fix and what Tyler has to offer. And so we may try to find a way to bring those two worlds together. Public works uses gis extensively, and one of the things that we really need to do is kind of bolster our GIS system. So we've been working with another vendor to try and get our GIS environment stabilized. It isn't just public works, it's community and economic development city as a whole that utilizes it. And so that needs to be ironed out. And one of the things that public works does rely on, of course, is time tracking payroll like we all do. And so that's going to affect them, too, in the long term. So, you know, I just imagine it would.

So is there, do we know where we have to customize compatibility so information can be transferred from one to the other, or is it something we may have to just run separately and manually put together, or abandon one, abandon the other and go into it, or. Well, you know, initially what we're planning on is converting some data from the existing system, certainly with financial data and hopefully from permits and business licenses as well. Yeah. And so there is a phase that we'll go through to try and pick up as much of that history, up to five years worth of history, and move it into the new system. So that'll be going on as well. Yeah, but I guess I was going back to using public works only as the example there. Whether there's other areas that I'm just not familiar with, that those software platforms will eventually be phased out and find one that's compatible with Taylor or. Or that the information can go from one to the other smoothly. Well, they've got a long list of partners. I know that Gary could probably elaborate better than I could. I know, in particular, we looked at the training pieces that Tyler had to offer, and so the city was already using something called Biz library, and I think we're going to continue with that. It's also true that we already use a recruiting module from a company called Neogov. And Neo Gov is probably going to have to be integrated into the Tyler platform. Moving ahead. Not necessarily replaced and so, but at the same time we're probably talking about eliminating govern, which is what we use now for business licenses, permits, that kind of stuff. Inspections, uses it for code enforcement. So that's going out. The cashiering, which is Inova, that's another piece that'll go out. Obviously gems, which is our HR payroll system right now, and the time tracking system from a tenant's enterprise will more than likely be replaced. The only other. What else am I missing? North Star. North Star. So yes, North Star will be phased out as well, which is another important component for utility billing. What else did I forget? That's fine. That's close enough. I'm just curious. Sometimes it's like a year and a half from down from now. It's kind of like, oh, by the way, we got to get rid of this software platform because it's not compatible with Taylor. We can't get information over to it or we're manually transferring, doing stuff. And so that's how. Just to know if we could avoid some of that or not. Well, I think we've tried as best we know how at this point. Right. You can't know everything. This is kind of a thing I've come to realize over the years. But you try to plan for as much as you can and it's going to be an interesting couple of years. The objective was to make sure that we are settled on this platform for a good five years. And after that we might talk about something different again. I don't know, but let's hope not because changing our financial software is. Oh yeah, no, no, I agree. It's not a thing we want to take life, but realistically there's always going to be changes. Natalie alluded to that too. There's going to be little bumps in the road that we stumble onto. Oh, we didn't know that. Sure. And so there is a little contingency built in to the project overall, but not a tremendous amount. So we have a little, just a little bit of wiggle room in there in case we stumble on or something like that. Mister Robinson, you want to say something? What is the percentage of this is going to be a lift and shift versus custom code with a lot of the old software and stuff that we currently have within our operation. It's all going so it's all going to be new code wow. So you mentioned, or I think Natalie mentioned about staff. Do we have the staff on hand to handle that? Or will, would that be shifted over to Tyler? As far as staffing component, we're going to come, have to come up with some sort of balancing act. I think the answer is no. We don't have anybody trained in Tyler today. As we move forward, the hope is we'll get trained in Tyler. But the reality is that, you know, without crying in my soup, there used to be eight of us in it, and now there's only five of us. And so we've made some changes over the last five, six, seven years that we just don't have extra brains anymore. And so there might need to be a little shoring up of staff as we move ahead. Yeah, that was going to be my next question about training. How is training? Has that been factored into all of this? It has. We talked about that in relatively good detail. There is a desire, I think, from Tyler's point of view, to do a train the trainer type of approach, and that will probably be the predominant approach. But at the same time, there are some things that. That may not work out well for, you know, when there's only one person that uses this piece or two people that uses this component. So we'll see how that goes. I know that approach. My job tries the same thing and it is a train wreck, unfortunately.

So we'll see how that goes. I know that approach. My job tries the same thing and it is a train wreck, unfortunately. I'm just being honest again, we're right in the middle of the same type of process where I just was sharing with Tim about one of the things we were doing last week at my job. So we're in the same process of doing the same type of thing. And my last question then is software. I mean, are we? I see software as a service is the platform we're going with. So I'm assuming that all of our data is going to be stored in a cloud base versus on site. So we're getting rid of all of our service, then we will phase them out over time. That's true. Okay. And one of the things that we sort of had anticipated, if we stayed status quo was we were going to have to replace some of the servers we were on anyway, especially things like Microsoft server, SQL, all of that stuff sort of underneath, as well as the unisys stuff. That kind of was in the middle for a while, and then you had gems on top of it. So it is possible that we are going to phase out a lot of servers over the course of the next two or three years. We won't have near what we used to have at least what we have now, which is probably around 50 or 60 boxes. So not all for that same thing. But in time we are going. So for like our police footage and everything, that's all cloud based now. Right now anyway. Some of it is and some of it isn't. So all of the body cameras, vehicle cameras, those all go up to the cloud, but we still have the fixed cameras, I call ones that are installed in buildings, intersections, that kind of stuff, those are all coming to the station and being recorded there. Okay, well, you know, I will get down in the weed. So I'll email you. I don't want to bore everyone with the technical things other than Robertson. I wanted to make sure I understood your first question. Did you ask if a lot of custom coding was going to need to be done? Yes. Yeah. So, no, that's not the case with this project at all. Yeah, well, we're not going to be doing any coding. No, not you, but Tyler will be doing coding. So what I mean by custom code is that work. So a lift and shift is you take the software that we currently have and you just plug it into what Tyler has, versus Tyler building something to accommodate that. Either they're building it from scratch, which we consider that as custom code because it's going to be kind of formatted to fit our environment or our needs. So we consider that custom code. Well, in our environment, we consider that custom code with that. That's what I mean by the training. Because eventually we either are going to be relying on Tyler to troubleshoot our issues or we're going to have staff on hand to troubleshoot those issues. I know a lot of it shops are going low code, no code, which they're doing. A lot of, you know, you know the terminology, it's going to be low code, no code. Okay. Yeah, I don't know the software. This is very much an off the shelf product. Yes, that's right. Yeah. So everyone says they will give you a package, and I'm not saying anything negative about Tyler, but they're going to give you a package. But what you will find out is sometimes what they present in that package is not going to be useful for you and you're going to need something custom. So this ensure that we at least we have that in our. In the back of our heads, everything off the shelf. We want to keep it as simple as possible. Yes, but sometimes there's going to be some things that are going to have to be custom. If it's a table, if it's a couple of tables. I have to talk to one another a certain way. You're not going to find that out of the box. And that was one of the issues. We found out we were presenting an out of the box option, which we should be able to do everything we needed to do. Once we dove in and actually got them on site and they started digging and through our code and our data, we had to customize a lot of stuff, so we had to backtrack. So that was kind of like my issues in the beginning, to ensure that we have an exit strategy. Because what we found out is once you get your code into these systems, it's hard to get it out. It's easy to go in with no code, low code. You're doing a totally different, you're not doing C sharp anymore, you're doing JavaScript. So it's totally different languages and it's a learning curve sometimes. Yeah. I think that the team specifically, I sort of went through the names of the team very, very first. We have met for months, basically. And one of the objectives that I kind of tried to get across was we're either going to have to adapt the software to us or we are going to have to change to the software. And predominantly the group is like, I think we're ready to change to meet what this software has to offer. And so we did have that discussion and it's, we're not going in with complete blinders on. They're aware of the fact that some changes on the horizon. But you're right, there's always a possibility that there will be some little thing off to the side and that's all, you know, that's always a risk. Right.

Thank you to the city. Thank you, Nina and Madeline. Thank you. Have a good day. Good night, guys. Thank you. Take care, too. Meister Bartells, you up first or next? I mean. Okay. All right. Well, good evening, city council. Thank you for allowing us again to present to the city council tonight to discuss the downtown project. As you all know, this is an update tonight to give you an update on the bids that we received and the revisions or the recommendations that were proposing to the council for the project moving forward. We received three bids for this project on February 15, and we opened bids on February 15, and we received three bids. And those were valley construction, Langman Construction, and McCarthy Construction. So between the bid opening on February 15 and now, the project team, standing or sitting next to me here, have been very busy working, going through this entire project. We had, obviously, a lot of bids. We've had a lot of alternates included in this project. So there's a lot of information to dissect and bring the best recommendations forward to the council that we feel will be the best investment for the city. And in the downtown, I mentioned the project team. So we have myself, we have Mike Kane, the city engineer, Jason McKenzie from BNK, the project manager. We have Jack Collin, the director from the downtown alliance, we have Andrew Dasso, the president of Streamline. And then we have Manzi. Yes. Yes. Sounds close enough, right? With streamline as well. So this is our project team. So the base bid. Oh, I'm sorry. We've had three project goals from the beginning on this project, and that was to enhance public spaces, encourage private investment, and improve the overall quality of life for downtown workers, business owners, and residents and visitors. So this is the project scope that we had. You can. I know some of these slides you've seen before. We've modified these with the information that we're presenting tonight. Can you all see what's in front of me on your computers? Okay. It's a little different. So. I'm sorry. I'm getting used to this here. So first Avenue, as we mentioned, will be starting construction in 2025. That's a IDOT project on being let this fall, and it's through service, transportation, block grants. So that that project is separate from this. The area in yellow and orange is what we call the base bid. That was originally the scope of the project to begin with and was really the focus of the project going along. We had several public comment or several public meetings and meetings with the council getting up to this point to where we went out for bids to have elements that the project like to see in the. The residents would like to see in the project. And so we've incorporated some of those. Those projects. These have come from downtown revitalization, revitalization plans, and other plans from. From the past here. So the alternates that I'm referring to are Arts alley cheek whiz. Sorry. Trying to. It's a little delayed, too. So Arts alley is an alternate. We had the outdoor lawn, lawn area, play area, then the green area there. That was a element that was added after we had our initial discussion as a result of public comment. And then the areas in Gray were also alternates, which was Third Avenue reconstruction from 17 to 18th street, the dog park and then the alley here next to the dog park. So the objectives again are with this project are a complete reconstruction of the streets and sidewalks from building face to building face. We're replacing all the utilities, water main, storm and sanitary sewers. We're making street escape improvements, including the streetlights, trees, benches and trash receptacles. We're also looking at place making to include public art lighting, gateway signage and outdoor patios. So what is being recommended with this project? So we're recommending the base bed be awarded, which is the reconstruction of Second Avenue Plaza to a festival street. 18th street reconstruction from first to Third Avenue and Third Avenue reconstruction from 18th to 19th street. This will include, as I said mentioned before, streetscaping, including trees, lighting, downtown gateway at First Avenue, gateway, columns, water, sewer and storm sewer. We're also recommending the art gallery revitalization that will include lighting, pavement murals, a vendor stall, new signage and an outdoor art gallery. Again, we're also recommending the 18th Street Green space area, which is converting the existing parking lot to green space.", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City Downtown Project", "insights": [{"observation": "The project aims to enhance public spaces, encourage private investment, and improve the overall quality of life for downtown workers, business owners, residents, and visitors.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project includes a complete reconstruction of the streets and sidewalks from building face to building face, replacing all utilities (water main, storm, and sanitary sewers).", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Streetscape improvements include streetlights, trees, benches, and trash receptacles.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project recommends the creation of place-making elements to include public art, lighting, gateway signage, and outdoor patios.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Public comment influenced the addition of an outdoor lawn area and play area in the green space.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The revitalization of Arts Alley will include lighting, pavement murals, a vendor stall, new signage, and an outdoor art gallery.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The area will have a new dog park as part of the project's alternates.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project includes recommendations for the reconstruction of multiple streets with enhanced green space, including converting an existing parking lot to green space.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City Downtown Project", "insights": [{"observation": "The project aims to enhance public spaces, encourage private investment, and improve the overall quality of life for downtown workers, business owners, residents, and visitors.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project includes a complete reconstruction of the streets and sidewalks from building face to building face, replacing all utilities (water main, storm, and sanitary sewers).", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Streetscape improvements include streetlights, trees, benches, and trash receptacles.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project recommends the creation of place-making elements to include public art, lighting, gateway signage, and outdoor patios.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Public comment influenced the addition of an outdoor lawn area and play area in the green space.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The revitalization of Arts Alley will include lighting, pavement murals, a vendor stall, new signage, and an outdoor art gallery.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The area will have a new dog park as part of the project's alternates.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project includes recommendations for the reconstruction of multiple streets with enhanced green space, including converting an existing parking lot to green space.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 2246614, "chunk_end_time": 2680992, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-x5k8Q2WJg", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-x5k8Q2WJg&t=2246s"}, {"start": 39000, "end": 45000, "text": "all the utilities, water main, storm and sanitary sewers.

This will include, as I said mentioned before, streetscaping, including trees, lighting, downtown gateway at First Avenue, gateway, columns, water, sewer and storm sewer. We're also recommending the art gallery revitalization that will include lighting, pavement murals, a vendor stall, new signage and an outdoor art gallery. Again, we're also recommending the 18th Street Green space area, which is converting the existing parking lot to green space. New lighting will have the Rock island place making signage that we have shown in previous, previous presentations that we'll also show here in later slides. What is not being recommended is the reconstruction of Third Avenue from 17 to 18th street, which is known as alternate two, the dog park, which is alternate three out of reconstruction near the dog park, which is alternate four, and the WHBF tower lighting. So these next several slides that I'm showing you are elements that are being included in the basement and alternates. One of the most exciting features that I think are included in this project is the gateway structure here at 18th street and First Avenue. So as you can tell, we spoke about this before, but this includes the traffic signal being installed or included in this structure. It'll have a stone veneer. It'll be lighted on the columns. And again, the downtown Rock island welcome to with the established 1841 will all be illuminated as well. It's a two sided structure, so when you exit the downtown, you'll see the same thing on the other side. And we're tying in First Avenue with elements of this project as well of this structure. As I mentioned, this is the other side of the gateway structure looking towards Shreiber park. And again, it's a very beautiful structure welcoming residents into the downtown at business. So this is part of the base bed here. Again, just a big aerial view. What I don't want to give people false hope. So the project is really actually ending right here. This is also all existing and will remain this way. So our western limit of Second Avenue is stopping here. But again, it's including the roundabout. You see the outdoor lawn structure there, the new festival plaza, all new pavement, new lighting. Really, really big improvement to this area in the downtown. Just a closer look at Second Avenue intersection at 18th street. So we have the roundabout. We'll talk about some of the items that were removed a little bit further down in the presentation for cost savings. One of those areas that I'll go ahead and mention was we included roundabout lights here in this area. We eliminated those for project savings. There was several elements in this project to get the project within the funding limits to that we eliminated and we'll go into those further in the presentation. So this is one of the alternates that we're recommending acceptance on, which is the outdoor lawn at Second Aven 18th street. This is near the DAC fact parking lot currently. You see the food trucks along 18th street there. We're providing electrical outlets for connections for those food trucks if needed or wanted. We also have the outdoor lawn area, new lighting up above. We feel like this is an outdoor area for people to come in and sit as shown, for young kids to run around and play. That's not a paved surface. They can fall down and skin their knees if needed. But again, this is one of the alternates that was wanted by the residents and we felt very important to include it in the project. This is the Rock island logo place making sign that we feel will be a great element for this area. Pictures can be taken behind the sign. Again, it's just that place making element that we wanted to make sure that was included in this project. So this is the project. Looking at the eastern limit on Third Avenue and 19th street. You can see Pancake House there. So we're just showing again the what the project will look like again. New lighting, new reconstruction of the streets. You've seen these images before, elements of the design, elements of the project. So we looked at lighting space 50ft apart on alternating sides. It's currently now at 60ft tree and in ground planters spaced 50ft apart on alternating sides. And then we had the picture frame concrete for the sidewalks shown in the lower right corner there. And as the new parking ramp, we utilize that for the new parking lot. Area. So if you wanted to see what that looks like, the new parking lot area, the exterior sidewalk has that picture frame sidewalk currently. So I'm going to turn it over to Jack Gallina now for the Arts alley and the patio discussions. Fantastic. Good evening, council. Thanks for the opportunity again, know most of you, but for those tuning in, my name is Jack Cullen, executive director of the Rock Island Downtown alliance, and I'm really excited to present on behalf of the downtown alliance tonight. Prior to the establishment of the downtown alliance, we had the downtown Rock island steering committee dating back to April 2021, that has provided input on these improvements since that time, taking input from the 2015 downtown plan, input from the downtown steering committee, to where we are at now with the rebuild downtown committee of the Downtown alliance, as well as our full board of directors.

So I'm going to turn it over to Jack Gallina now for the Arts alley and the patio discussions. Fantastic. Good evening, council. Thanks for the opportunity again, know most of you, but for those tuning in, my name is Jack Cullen, executive director of the Rock Island Downtown alliance, and I'm really excited to present on behalf of the downtown alliance tonight. Prior to the establishment of the downtown alliance, we had the downtown Rock island steering committee dating back to April 2021, that has provided input on these improvements since that time, taking input from the 2015 downtown plan, input from the downtown steering committee, to where we are at now with the rebuild downtown committee of the Downtown alliance, as well as our full board of directors. And so over the past month, since the bids were returned, we've worked with the committee and the board to come up with these proposals as well. And Mike touched on this. But I want to go back, just real brief on this overview. We initially didn't include the green lawn into the proposed, as part of the proposed recommendations, and it was our rebuild downtown committee, the downtown alliance, that came back at us and said, well, which is very smart and good comment. If we're improving everything around that space and we'll just maintain that older parking lot there, it will feel unfinished. And so that was indirect response to input from that committee. Again, just as an example, to show how we've worked with that committee of the board to get to this point. Now, it also aligns with feedback that we got from the community at one of our larger public input meetings during this process. Jack, sorry to interrupt. Can you share who serves on that committee? For my colleagues, yes. It's a five person committee of the downtown board. Amanda Wood of Russell Construction, who is representing the federal building. She also sits on our board. Erica Williams, who is a property owner and resident at Dumarche Condos. Greg Stecker, owner of Secker Graphics, property owner downtown. Pat Stolly, who is a registered contractor with the city of Rock island, he's a building owner downtown. And Laura Mon, who is the executive director of Nescafe. So a variety of perspectives, both from folks who have been involved in downtown for a long time or who've, whose families have been involved downtown for a long time, as well as those who are, you know, newer, if you will, whether they run an organization or own a business or some sort of an operation downtown. So thank you for that. Laura and Pat are not on the board. They're downtown stakeholders. The other three are on our full board of directors. So, moving on to Arts Alley, as you recall, and we'll get into the different funding sources of the project in a little bit. But this is a direct result of a state of Illinois tourism attraction and festivals grant that we help secure in partnership with the city. One of the most exciting pieces about this project are the large scale murals. The goal for these murals, and they are gigantic. I mean, combined, we have over 4000 wall space. And one of the goals with this, with the murals specifically, is to come up with something stylistically that doesn't exist anywhere else in the quad cities, really helping to create that tourism attraction. People coming here to look at those large scale murals done in Arts Alley and I guess one rewind as a reminder to folks who may be forgetting, but there used to be a building in this space and in the early nineties it was demolished. And as a form of infill development, Arts Alley was created. We believe this project is really taking it to that next step, to its fullest potential as an outdoor art gallery, social gathering place, special event, shared space in the downtown. We are working with Quad City Arts on the request for qualifications and getting to the point where we're actually selecting muralists. We had over 400 submissions from artists around the world for this, and so extremely exciting. We've narrowed down that list to just over 130 artists. And that is strictly based on qualifications and quality, based on the views from our partners at Quad City Arts. And so we'll be actively working with downtown stakeholders, with the building owners on both sides of Arts Alley, the Public Arts and Beautification Commission, as well as seeking opportunities for other ways to garner public input on finalizing the designs, what the actual murals will become in that space. So more to come there. Decorative string lighting throughout the alley. Opportunity for other smaller artworks in the frames along more kind of the street level. Part of the alleyway. New signage marking that this is Arts alley. Decorative concrete throughout the space. A vendor stall that can be used. Initially we had the idea of using it as part of a holiday shop up or pop up shop program where entrepreneurs, artists, businesses could come in and test the market as kind of part of a holiday program in Arts Alley and downtown Rock island. We initially had two in this part of the project, but as a cost saving piece, we cut it down to one. One of the exciting pieces about this structure is that it's a modular unit and so it actually can be repurposed into say, a pop up stage that can be used in a different part of the downtown. It's a temporary structure in Arts LA. So again, modular, designed as temporary, pop it up for a specific time of year when it's being programmed and it's actively being used. Say it's November, December during the holiday season, summer concert series on the new festival street. We could use that on the green lawn as a pop up stage, as an example that it can serve many different uses. Something that is exciting to me, not, you can't see it in this rendering, but part of the proposed scope of the arts Alley project is to have a dumpster enclosure cr", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Rock Island Downtown Alliance", "insights": [{"observation": "The project includes large scale murals designed to create tourism attraction.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Arts Alley project takes space to its fullest potential as an outdoor art gallery and social gathering space.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Selection of muralists based on qualifications and quality, with over 400 submissions from artists around the world.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Decorative string lighting throughout the alley to enhance aesthetic appeal.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Modular vendor stall used for holiday pop-up shops and other events.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Quad City Arts", "insights": [{"observation": "Actively working with downtown stakeholders, building owners, and Public Arts and Beautification Commission for public input on mural designs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Over 400 artist submissions for mural project, demonstrating global interest and inclusivity.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City of Rock Island", "insights": [{"observation": "Secured a state of Illinois tourism attraction and festivals grant in partnership with the Rock Island Downtown Alliance.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Rock Island Downtown Alliance", "insights": [{"observation": "The project includes large scale murals designed to create tourism attraction.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Arts Alley project takes space to its fullest potential as an outdoor art gallery and social gathering space.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Selection of muralists based on qualifications and quality, with over 400 submissions from artists around the world.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Decorative string lighting throughout the alley to enhance aesthetic appeal.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Modular vendor stall used for holiday pop-up shops and other events.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Quad City Arts", "insights": [{"observation": "Actively working with downtown stakeholders, building owners, and Public Arts and Beautification Commission for public input on mural designs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Over 400 artist submissions for mural project, demonstrating global interest and inclusivity.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City of Rock Island", "insights": [{"observation": "Secured a state of Illinois tourism attraction and festivals grant in partnership with the Rock Island Downtown Alliance.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 2961950, "chunk_end_time": 3380036, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-x5k8Q2WJg", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-x5k8Q2WJg&t=2961s"}, {"start": 49000, "end": 55000, "text": "where entrepreneurs, artists, businesses could come in and test the market as kind of part of a holiday program in Arts Alley and downtown Rock island.

Something that is exciting to me, not, you can't see it in this rendering, but part of the proposed scope of the arts Alley project is to have a dumpster enclosure created on the north end of the alleyway, actually using some of modern women of America's property that they're willing to work with this on, on having a dumpster enclosure to remove the dumpsters from Arts Alley and hopefully some of those that are adjacent to Arts alley as well to clean up the space. If we're trying to make it a tourist attraction, not wanting to have the dumpsters in that space. This is an aerial. We have a holiday or Christmas tree at the south end of Arts Alley. Again, as another example of something, a way it could be programmed. You know, perhaps we do an annual Christmas tree lighting where the mayor fires up the Christmas tree and it's right there on the south end of Arts hall. Again, an example. The tree itself isn't as part of the proposed scope of work, but something that we could explore in the future. Outdoor patios. This has been, you know, the project is called the rebuild downtown. And the name of this grant we're getting from the state of Illinois is the rebuild downtowns and Main Streets grant program. Part of this is about continuing to recover from the pandemic and supporting businesses that were established prior to the pandemic, survived the economic hardships of that time and are still thriving. And one of the very tangible ways that we'd like to do that is through the additional of an outdoor patio district to not only enhance the streetscape, but really provide a way for businesses to expand their footprint out into the public realm, in addition, as another way to help market promote their business at the street level. So we've seen a lot of successful programs across the country during the pandemic up until now, and many are still being created just as we're proposing. This overview gives you an aerial map of where we would like to see the outdoor patio structures go. And so there are ten establishments that are on this map and the reason we have ten there as well. A number of businesses that offer dining throughout the downtown, but also have the infrastructure or the sidewalk that would allow these structures. And so, based off council input, following one of our last discussions, all of the patio structures are proposed for on the sidewalk. Nothing that is taking up parking spaces and carrying out or spilling out into the street. And so that was one of our priorities as we explored with the different vendors we were looking at, is to put these on the sidewalks in front of businesses, but as a way to help them expand their footprint. This is a bit smaller. You may see better images on your screen, but these are the specific specs that we put out in this bid package for the outdoor patio structures for the different restaurants based on what their store frontage is. We came up with different or custom designs in terms of the patio fencing for each of these establishments. So the idea with this is that, again, this is also a modular unit, modular fencing that we would be receiving assistance with to install for the first time. But moving forward would be a collaboration between the downtown alliance and Rock island public works to put these up. It's really a six month seasonal structure. We wouldn't want these to be out in the wintertime, you know, unless, of course, a business wants to make further investments into their structure. There's actually modular pieces that you can cover these to make it more of an indoor, more of an indoor structure during the winter months, but these would be to make clear bolted into the ground during the summer season or outdoor dining season, and then could be removed during the winter months. Businesses would be responsible for providing their own tables and chairs and can keep them out overnight through a simple lock cable. If there were concerns about people running through or running away with a chair or table, there, there are ways to prevent that from happening. But yes, we would be purchasing them, providing them for the restaurants. Restaurants would have an opportunity to further customize as well. In lieu of one of those wooden panels, a restaurant could purchase a custom made sign to fit into one of those panels for their business. To again enhance that marketing aspect. Planters and other decorative features can be added on as well. But we wanted to invest in the base infrastructure for this patio fencing to provide for the businesses. This is an example of it out on the street. The vision I like to give is, you know, it's a Saturday morning, 10:00 a.m. you're. You're wanting to go to the pancake house for brunch with your family, guaranteed at least a 45 minutes wait at that time of day on a Saturday. And so we envision folks taking a walk through the adjacent alleyway onto the festival street. There's outdoor dining structures. Perhaps there's a farmer's market. You know, you can get a little bite to eat coffee or a drink, enjoy one of these outdoor structures, the adjacent green lawn, places for your children to play", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Arts Alley Project", "insights": [{"observation": "The project includes a modular unit that is temporary and can be repurposed for various events such as a pop-up stage.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Creating a dumpster enclosure to remove dumpsters from Arts Alley to clean up the space.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Adding a holiday or Christmas tree lighting event at the south end of Arts Alley.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Supporting businesses recovering from the pandemic by creating the outdoor patio district.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Downtown Alliance and Rock Island Public Works", "insights": [{"observation": "Installing modular fencing for outdoor patios to enhance the streetscape and support businesses.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Collaboration between Downtown Alliance and Rock Island Public Works for installing and maintaining the modular fencing.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The modular units for outdoor patios can be customized by businesses with their own signage and decorative features.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Arts Alley Project", "insights": [{"observation": "The project includes a modular unit that is temporary and can be repurposed for various events such as a pop-up stage.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Creating a dumpster enclosure to remove dumpsters from Arts Alley to clean up the space.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Adding a holiday or Christmas tree lighting event at the south end of Arts Alley.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Supporting businesses recovering from the pandemic by creating the outdoor patio district.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Downtown Alliance and Rock Island Public Works", "insights": [{"observation": "Installing modular fencing for outdoor patios to enhance the streetscape and support businesses.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Collaboration between Downtown Alliance and Rock Island Public Works for installing and maintaining the modular fencing.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The modular units for outdoor patios can be customized by businesses with their own signage and decorative features.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 3311046, "chunk_end_time": 3712344, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-x5k8Q2WJg", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-x5k8Q2WJg&t=3311s"}, {"start": 54000, "end": 60000, "text": "s would have an opportunity to further customize as well.

And then you head back to brunch after that short stint and hit a couple of shops after that. But that's, again, kind of the vision that goes along with these improvements that we're putting in front of you tonight. And with that, I will hand it back to Mike Bartels. Correct? Or, excuse me. Jason McKenzie from Beansturn Kim. Thank you, counsel. Yeah, Jason McKenzie with Beanstreng Kim. I'm just gonna run through the numbers and talk through some of the items being moved for two future phases and a cost breakdown, and then just kind of, kind of summarize where we are in the schedule. So, as they alluded to, there's the $3 million, basically Illinois rebuild downtown grant. There'll be $3.9 million of ARPA funds in this project, 1.5 of the downtown, downtown TIF funds. And then basically, there's a grant for 267,000 for the Illinois tourism attraction grant for a total of 8.7 million. So this spreadsheet right here kind of goes through. We worked with downtown alliance committee, downtown alliance board, Rock island staff, and the project team to kind of go through these items being moved to future items. Two gateway columns, basically kind of in front of one, in front of circa, the one in QC Pancake house will be moved out of the project for 36,000, some planters for 11,000, the pop up stage for 25, the dumpster enclosure. Basically, we'll be having the one dumpster enclosure adjacent to Arts Alley, but we'll be eliminating the one that's basically between Second and Third Avenue and then 19th and 18th street in that alley right there. And then, as Mike Bartell has talked about, the roundabout lights will be eliminated out of there. That's not a safety issue. It was just kind of aesthetics, some aggregate base. We're just changing to a different spec. Got a little bit of savings there. And then also down the list there, the parklets. We basically took those out of the base bid for 192,000, and then just directly contracted with the vendor for 124. And then there, over in Arts Alley, we eliminated one vendor stall for 103,000. And then the postcard wall, 85,000. And then the green screen, 75,001. Thing to add is the murals cost that Jack was talking about is 102,000. So that'll be added into this into this contract. So this is all added in the 18th street lawn. We took away the play structures for 22,000. So we were able to cut out about 700,000 out of the base bid, alt one, and alt five out of there. Working with everybody. And also working with Valley construction, we went and talked with them, and these are the numbers that they confirmed for the cuts. And then, so for a revised bid of the base bid. Art Sally and then alt five, which is the 18th street lawn, there'd be a about seven, 7,757,650, 2000. And then as far as engineering, 500,000. Then also, we thought it was crucial to have a contingency in here because we'll be working in an older downtown area and there'll be some unforeseen things that come up. So we included a 5% contingency in there for any unforeseen items. So for a total of price of 8.7 million. And then, as we just talked about the last slide, the secure funds are 8.7. This is kind of a cost breakdown. Just to kind of show you what's going to be included in the project. There'll be five blocks of pavement and then there'll be five blocks of sidewalk being all reconstructed, four blocks of water. Water being reconstructed brand new, same with sanitary. And then storm, and then five blocks of new electrical with lighting, and then four blocks of landscaping and the, and the green lawn there. And then five blocks of furnishings and then some miscellaneous items there. So as we, we're here today at the council asking for approval, and then if we get approval, we'll move forward with a pre construction meeting with the contractor this week. And then we'll also then have a downturn. Downtown stakeholder meeting the following week to go over phasing and schedule. And then valley, talking about valley construction, they want to get started right away. So sounds like they'll probably get started the following Monday on the 8 April. And so construction will start about the 8 April at this time. Well, I just want to thank you for your time and open it up to any questions anyone might have. I have one. So just as I'm looking at the, the plaza area, the street there, I don't, I don't notice any lane markings down the center line. Markings? Are we not having any? I guess at first this is, these are just conceptual, so. Right. I'm just checking because every time that keeps popping up, I don't see them. I'm just making sure I'm in the, we're looking at. That's something we're doing. Correct. Down the plaza. Yeah, it's a. It's the city's choice. They. We could put them, or we don't have to put them. Just do this residential street. But we can. We can put. Mike, what's your thoughts on that? I mean, we have it. We probably should include them. Yes. Okay. Is that a. Okay, one more question real quick.

It's going to be a bunch of new flashy lights, etcetera, with this project. Is there any concern from your perspective, that this will negatively impact our designation on the National Register for Historic Places? See, the great thing about being in this room is that I don't have to be up here. I can stay right here and talk to you. So. So those concerns have been raised before. And obviously, when you look at these renderings, you'll see a couple of things. One, the lights that we have been using, which have a more kind of historically sensitive design. Those are being continued throughout to try to be mindful of that. There are more modern looks that we could have gone for. This is probably something in the middle when you look at it holistically. As for the kind of long term health of the historic district, really, that's focused on the buildings themselves, not so much the streetscapes around them. So I wouldn't say there's any concerns. Okay, thank you. Mike, would you go ahead and talk about the agenda items related to this and kind of how the numbers. The numbers are in that approval item? All right. It's froze. There you go. Okay, great. Are you referring to more of the ARPA discussion? Yeah. But then also the nature of the, the approval item and what we're asking them to do related to letting us continue to value engineer it. The numbers are a little bit different. Sure. So we originally had 2.5 million of ARPA funds budgeted for this project. As mentioned, we've included 1.4 million of ARPA funds that were originally allocated for the Millstreet digester project. That project currently has expanded in scope. It's beyond what the 1.4 million would cover significantly. And so we're looking at other funding, funding options for that project. So it would not meet the timeline that is required by ARPA for construction. So we, the project came in over budget for water and sewer to begin with. So we've reallocated those funds for water and sewer and then some other qualified ARPA expenses as well. So that's where you see that increase. Again, we've included the contingency for the project at 5%, which is about $466,000 for the project. That's one of the other changes that wasn't originally planned for. And then we still have engineering and contract expenses. Expenses for once the construction begins, we'll have a full time construction inspector on the property project, inspecting the work that takes place, doing material testing, and we'll have construction layout as well. So that is some ongoing expenses that will still need to be paid for. So if there's any questions, the memo goes into it in pretty good depth. One thing to point out with the alternates, we included these alternates because of either public comment from our public meetings of wanting to see this, these items in it, or from Jack's meetings with the downtown alliance and workgroups. Just because they're not being included at this point in time doesn't mean that they want to be included in future phases. The nice thing about them being alternates, we have a exact price, at least at this point in time, of what the costs will be. We can plan for those moving forward. We can look at different funding sources for those, whether it be grants or, you know, cds spending, those type of options. And the work has already been designed, engineered, and ready to go out for bid. So we could take these plans for these alternates. And if the council wanted to allocate additional funding for these projects, say, next year or even, even this year, we could, we could put out the project within a week or two weeks time frame, change some dates on the current plans and put them out for bid. So that work has already been designed and ready to go, which is nice it's unfortunate that we can't move forward with all these elements, but again, it's not. We don't want to make sure. We want to make sure that the council's aware and everybody in the city that these projects can happen in the future should funding become available. I have a question.

Why was the decision made to do Third Avenue instead of just doing all of Second Avenue? So that was one of the items that I wanted to see included in the project. We have businesses along, along that area. It ties in the new parking lot that we just constructed and would tie in the rest of our construction. So it's kind of working our way into that. All the new improvements that we're talking about tonight. Again, we hoped that we would receive the project funding to be able to do that alternate, but we just came in over budget. My concern is just exactly what you said, but I take the opposite approach, that we have businesses currently there, so why not take an area that does not have businesses? I mean, there's way more open spaces on Second Avenue than on Third Avenue. So that was just my concern. Yeah, and that's. And Jack can kind of allude to that, too, but we have. Not necessarily about the business that you're pointing out, but wherever we go in the downtown, we're always going to have someone upset with where we're doing the work and where we're not, you know, again, we go, we touch back to the second avenue, the roundabout area as being the focal point of the downtown, expanding from there. These are future improvements, improvements that, again, like, if we have funding to do that street, that would be one of the areas that I would recommend moving forward with right away. But it just. You don't have the funding. And Mike Kane is our historian on this, but I've been saying he's old and that's out of, out of full respect. But the, the 1700 block of Second Avenue and the 1600 block of Second Avenue were redone more recently, I believe. Yep. But why not? Why not doing all of second? So I think that was also part of, you know, the reasoning going in behind that, too, is that it's newer infrastructure on those two adjacent blocks. They already have, like the pedestrian scale street lighting as an example. But hopefully, this serves as a great framework for going block by block in the future. Now that we have these design guidelines, we know the type of sidewalk panels that we want, the types of street lighting, the diversity in tree species, things of that nature. Hopefully it sets us up for success for going block by block in the coming years as funding allows. I just got a quick question about the lighting on the, on the lawn. I understand we're going into costs a little bit, so I don't know what the cost is for the rope lights on the green lawn. Have we thought about doing this like a pole since. Because since that whole. That whole area has kind of changed. We took the playground equipment out, we kind of took the stage out. I don't know what kind of programming we're looking out there. I know Jack said something about we could do a pop up stage or something like that, but have we thought about changing the design of those lights just so it's not just like we threw rope lights all over the downtown area. We haven't thought about changing the way the lighting is laid out currently, as shown. We have pricing to make those modifications ahead of time should the council want. Want to make those changes. I believe it's just a linear foot for the string lighting, so we know exactly what the cost is per foot. And then each light pole or light pole, we have each price for those as well. So if you wanted to remove the string lighting, add in some vertical pole lighting, we could do that and give you those costs. Gotcha. We would just need to know that obviously here in the next month or two. Jack, real quick, for Arts Alley, are we uplighting the murals? I think in the presentation it looked like we had some uplighting on that. I don't know if that's in this. We don't have a component for uplighting in this proposed scope. Correct me if I'm wrong. Do we? No, we do not. This is, though, something that we've had preliminary conversations with, about, with the building owners. Not specifically around uplighting these murals, but uplighting those buildings in general. And one of the property owners has brought it up as something that they would potentially be interested in. So not in the proposed scope, but perhaps it's something that we could work through as a, you know, a secondary phase. I guess I'm just looking at the aesthetics. If it's at night, I think that will be. That will just make that area pop. Yep. If you have the rope lights, it's kind of. Someone's gonna shadow it where you can't see the murals at night. And that will help enhance it a little bit to kind of bring that area into, you know, more of a festive vibe or whatever, but you can highlight it some. Some way. Just some thoughts? No, that's a great, great input, and I appreciate the comment about the green lawn lighting as well. Not sure if on the market there are opportunities with the string lights to help do any sort of uplighting, but something that we can explore. So you could put them on the roof and get rid of the poles attaching to private property and that sort of thing.

It's pretty high up. Great input. One of the pieces, and it was brought up by Alderman Parker, one of the concerns, I think, that was potentially there from the state historic preservation office was around affecting any residents in buildings. And so that is one of the pieces to be sensitive about in terms of uplighting or downlighting from up high. One of these buildings is residence and windows. And so let's say that's one of the constraints, you know, with the lighting component. The other piece they don't show there. It's windows. Yeah. Now that's. I mean, that was their initial concern.
