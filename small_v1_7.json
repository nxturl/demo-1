Eight members present. Oh, Mister Dedal. Next we have CB 37, an act concerning supplementary appropriations for the purpose of declaring additional revenue and appropriating to the general fund, an internal service fund to provide for costs that were not anticipated and included in the approved fiscal year 2024 budget. We will have a staff overview by Nathaniel Tutt. Good afternoon, madam chair. CB 37 2024, an act concerning supplementary appropriations. The legislation, if enacted, adjusts revenue estimates, increases general fund appropriations, and authorizes intra departmental transfers in the Internal Service Fund for the FY 24 25 budget as established in CB 63 2023. CB 37 2024 provides additional appropriation authority totaling $45,807,000 in the general fund. The following revenue adjustments in the bill serve to offset much of the supplemental budget increases, an adjustment in revenue estimates for the general real property tax receipts and an increase of 8.7 million. Interest income under use of money and property, an increase of 12.5 million and other miscellaneous receipts from radio one payments which increase $900,000 and Board of Education outside sources, 13 million. The remaining $10 million is covered by the use of assigned fund balance enactment of CB 37, according to our policy analysis team and Andrew Stover wrote the document, will have an adverse fiscal impact related to the use of the $10 million in fund balance I mentioned, with the remainder of additional expenditures being offset by the additional revenue. As noted, the legislation increases the fiscal year 2024 general fund budget from 4.5 billion to 4.559 $440,400. Thank you, Madam Chair. Oh, and we have Mister Brent Johnson, one of the senior staffers at the department of office of Management and Budget, I should say, is here with me. Do you have some comments you'd like to share?

Now we're going to kick it off to the committee director, Mister Albert Obeer, sir. Thank you and good afternoon. I will turn over to David Nota, the legislative budget and policy analyst, to provide an overview of employee Prince George's proposed fiscal year 2025 budget. Good afternoon Chair Harrison and members of the Education Workforce Development Committee. My name is David Noto and I'm a member of the Office of Budget and Policy and I'll be presenting on employ Prince George's fiscal year 2025 proposed budget report this report can be found on page 200 of your virtual Binder employ Prince George is a 501 organization that serves as the the primary employment services division of the county that is partially funded through annual county grants in the non departmental section of the budget. The proposed 2025 budget totals $18,323,100, an increase of 1.9 million, or 11.7%, over the fiscal year 2024 approved budget. These budget increases are driven by an increase in operating costs, annualization of planned salary adjustments, and additional staffing needed to support new grant programs. The proposed budget includes a direct county contribution of 3.6 million made up of the county executive grant of 1.7 million, the reentry program grant of 300,000, the video lottery terminal grant of $637,700, and the returning Citizens Affairs Division grant of $1 million. Employee Prince George is also expected to receive an additional grant from the county in the form of a department of Family Services grant of $214,000. These represent about 21% of the total budget. On page two of your report you will see a table showing a breakdown of the different funding streams from the county and the relative portion of the money from each two employed. All three expenditure categories are proposed to increase due to annualization. Planned salary adjustments and additional staffing. Operating expenses are proposed. The fiscal year 2025 staffing account includes 21 county funded full time positions, which has remained constant from the previous fiscal year, but non county funded positions have increased to 99 non county funded positions, up from 81 in fiscal year 2024. Page seven outlines employ Prince George's mission and core services, as well as their accomplishments in fiscal year 2024. Among their major accomplishments for this past fiscal year are they created and increased a pipeline of workers that go through training and enter apprenticeships through the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. They increased the number of participants engaged in pre apprenticeship and apprenticeship trainings in all industries, increased traffic flow and programming at the national at the American Jobs Center National harbor and enhanced their commitment to bring special populations such as returning citizens and youth, through development of the bridge center at Adams House and the Youth Career center, as well as launching a system to track participant services across the workforce ecosystem to limit duplication of services and improve customer outcomes. Employ Prince George's primary concern is the decrease in the county's work labor force. From January 2019 to January 2024, the county has 18,614 fewer jobs in its labor force and 10,505 fewer jobs. Nonetheless, the January 2024 numbers are an improvement from January 2023 numbers, with the county having gained over 1800 workers and over 2950 jobs. The charts on page nine of the report show some of employ Prince George's performance metrics over the past five fiscal years, which show significant improvements in the number of jobs posted by employee Prince George's and a steady improvement in the percentage of employ Prince George's placements who remained employed at the business in which they were placed after one year. Thank you. That concludes my remarks on employee Prince George's. If you have questions about the report, I'm happy to take them at this time. Thank you, sir. Now we're going to kick it over to the president and CEO Walter Simmons to speak on his budget. Good afternoon, committee members. We decided because we were here about three weeks ago, to not go through another 45 minutes of presentation. But as the council staff did highlight, the main focus is going to be on a labor force recovery strategy. When we compare 20, when we look at 24, compared to pre Covid, when you're looking at right December of 19 Maryland, and when we're talking resident workforce, that's going a different, that's going away from the economic development employment number.

Now we're going to kick it over to the president and CEO Walter Simmons to speak on his budget. Good afternoon, committee members. We decided because we were here about three weeks ago, to not go through another 45 minutes of presentation. But as the council staff did highlight, the main focus is going to be on a labor force recovery strategy. When we compare 20, when we look at 24, compared to pre Covid, when you're looking at right December of 19 Maryland, and when we're talking resident workforce, that's going a different, that's going away from the economic development employment number. But looking at your La U S data, your local area unemployment, which is resident employment, Maryland lost 160,000 workers out of its labor force, and that's resident workers. Out of that 160,000, Prince George county equates to close to 30,000. So when you look at the 24 municipalities, of course 30,000 out of that is a large number. We also know that the labor force reduction chronically impacted those who were what you call just making it, you know, you're working poor population, which we really consider the Alice population asset, limited income constrained but employed, which means they're about $1,000 away from $1,000 expense, emergency expense away from being below the poverty line. So that's where you see an increase in our outreach efforts, the mobile job center, things of that sort. We can't fill positions if we don't have the workers. And so we have to figure out how do we rebound from those 30,000 that are not on any. They're out of the system means they're not on unemployment, they're not on taNf, they're not on snap. We have to reengage them with some point of the system. And so that will be really an ongoing theme, which we expect for the next few years, of how do we reengage? And we think the best portion of the re engagement is to start with our school system and starting there with the population that's graduating and connecting them to local businesses and opportunities. Also our colleges and universities, then looking at our other non traditional populations. When I mean nontraditional, I mean the populations that pre pandemic employers didn't want to hire, that is returning citizens, that is immigrants, that is high school dropouts, that is people with lower skills. Because now that there isn't a large population of workers, these traditionally non traditional or populations that they'd want to engage, they are a population that do want to engage. As we saw with the kickoff to reentry month, some of our large businesses have already started making commitments to higher populations. Luminous health, where we held the kickoff of the second chance month, is one of those larger businesses that has made a commitment to hire returning citizens, which we didn't see from our, you know, your larger businesses historically. And so what we tend to do is to really identify those populations through our reentry program, through our populations that are working with immigrants. We just launched our first CDL program that is in Spanish. So a CDL spanish program. I was. Was there this morning at the site in Forestville. And so that's the work that we will continue. Also working on entrepreneurship with the gig economy and creating those where we have entrepreneurship programs for reentry for young people and for immigrants, refugees in the sales. So that labor force recovery strategy, we already have a low unemployment, 2%, 2.4%. But that doesn't tell the true story of populations that have been left behind. We want to try to get those populations reengaged and then also work on our young people to build the future pipeline. And the one thing that we'd also like to highlight as well is the work in the community to engage. So tomorrow, we are opening our first american job center job and resource lab. We want to put one in every 27 municipalities this committee helped us connect. So district Heights is going to be the first to open tomorrow. We invite everybody to attend about 10:00 we also, our next is Laurel and the multi service center is open in there. And we hope that through the next year we'll see six or seven resource labs pop up in our communities. We're also working with a storage facility recommended by chair Ivey to really bring these services to the community and really using what you call credible messengers. That's how we're going to connect with the unconnected, disconnected population is to not ask them to come to our job center, but to go to where they are and work through people that they already trust. And that's how we're really going to rebuild this 30,000 workers that we lost. So I don't want to bore you with another hour long presentation, so I'll keep it there. Thank you. President and CEO, Mister Simmons. Colleagues, are there any questions for Mister Simmons? We have vice chair Watson. Thank you Mister chair. Good to see you all. You know, EPG is close to my heart. Just have one question, because you all really answered a lot of questions previously. But in regard to you mentioned working with the schools and reengaging in regards to the labor force recovery strategy. So in one of our budget hearings, I believe it was EDC, it was mentioned that cyber and it was lacking as far as trying to find the appropriate people to hire in the county.

So in one of our budget hearings, I believe it was EDC, it was mentioned that cyber and it was lacking as far as trying to find the appropriate people to hire in the county. They can't find those people here. So I didn't know. Is that one of the industries that were looking to help fill, based on who were kind of re engaging at the schools and what, or what industries are we looking to the schools to engage them to fill positions for which type? Which industry is what I'm trying to say. Yeah. So we've identified. We've identified 13 in demand industries. That's a lot to try to do it all. So we broke them down into six clusters. One of those clusters is it and cybersecurity. Second is professional services. The third is construction and real estate. The fourth is hospitality and accommodation. We also are looking at transportation logistics. We're also looking at healthcare and social assistance. So those are the six clusters we are convening employers. We have business advisory councils. Each of those employers is working with a contractor which is called a council for adult and experiential learning Cael. And we're developing career pathways and competency maps. We've already released two. One for healthcare and a second for retail and hospitality. Next up is going to be it and cybersecurity and the rest of those clusters, they should be released by the end of this calendar year. And part of that work is letting the young people know which industries are prevalent, what are the skill sets, what are the certifications, but also what are the on ramps. Can you start working this career in high school? Can we match that interest that you have in school with your summer youth employment, either through the Office of Human Resources or we have multiple summer youth programs along with these other summer youth programs. So we're working with these different programs to connect them with employers and placements so that what they're learning in the schools matches what they're doing in the summer and really creating those on ramps. Also working on apprenticeship opportunities. But those six clusters which have the highest business and employment need. We are trying to match young people and also their parents. So when we engage, we're also engaging the parents and letting their parents know. And that's key to that strategy of working with your offices and the municipalities, of letting their parents know what's available to them and then bringing in those non traditional community partners like Patriot Technology Center. Thurman is someone that has been around for 30 years. People have known. He just got a building donated to him through bank of America. They do the cyber, they do the academies, they do the competitions. That class and those competitions should have 1000 students packed, right? Having a couple of hundred at this size of our county isn't enough. So we need to do a better job of getting the word out. I mean, and they have NASA, they have Northrop Grumman, they have DoD contractors. The employers are already coming to them because they need to work. We have to do a better job of getting the students and their parents aware of those opportunities. And so that's what we hope to do. Focus. And that's why we're concentrating on those six clusters, which does include it, and cybersecurity. Okay. And one question to piggyback on that. Do you have people in the schools or in every school in the county, or is there some engagement with all the schools in the county? And how do you do that? Well, through the blueprint for Maryland's future, there was a component to fund the workforce boards to put staff in the schools. We are working with Prince Church county public Schools right now. We aren't in the schools yet. Weekly we'd like to be. We're having a huge push, really, that started this week with the school system to talk to the principals and try to get in front of those graduating seniors that aren't on track for the college of the military. I hope it's by the first day of next school year. We've hired 50 career consultants to be in every middle and high school across the public school system. And that's our goal. That at the start of next year those 50 will start to be in the schools on a weekly basis. Thank you. Thank you Madam vice chair Watson, councilmember, orator, before we turn to you, I know Mister early wanted to make a quick comment. Mister, thank you Mister chair. Just quick comment. Coming out of Annapolis there may be an additional adjustment in the budget for employ Prince George's as there was a program that we believe may give a little more resources. So that may be coming. And I also wanted to say that I think Mister Simmons has really identified a critical problem. The state, the state's chief economist has talked about has put out some interesting material that Maryland is not only we not only have that shrunken workforce, but we are separated from the other states around us because they're in a more upward trend. So it's a little bit hard to explain because even people like in the DC that's higher cost area is it has that. So that is a, so the area he's talking about is a much more critical focus than it was a year ago. Thank you Mister early council member Oriato. Thank you. Thank you for the presentation.

Just quick comment. Coming out of Annapolis there may be an additional adjustment in the budget for employ Prince George's as there was a program that we believe may give a little more resources. So that may be coming. And I also wanted to say that I think Mister Simmons has really identified a critical problem. The state, the state's chief economist has talked about has put out some interesting material that Maryland is not only we not only have that shrunken workforce, but we are separated from the other states around us because they're in a more upward trend. So it's a little bit hard to explain because even people like in the DC that's higher cost area is it has that. So that is a, so the area he's talking about is a much more critical focus than it was a year ago. Thank you Mister early council member Oriato. Thank you. Thank you for the presentation. I just had a few questions. One, I wanted to start with the reentry program that you guys have with the incentives in the private sector. I just want to make sure my notes were correct. Are there three businesses right now that are, are in partnership you guys are in partnership with for that program, the private sector? You're talking about the Princess County Reentry Employment Incentive fund? Yeah, it's at the early stages of launch, but we've expressed more, we've seen more businesses express interest, but putting them through the application process has been limited so far. Okay. And then for I know there's a pathway to government jobs program. Is that a program that is just open that just. Our focus is on specifically returning citizens. So pathways the government focuses on returning citizens getting into government jobs. How many have been placed to date in that program with jobs? I think I'd have to give you the exact number. I don't think it's changed much from March due to some hiring slowing at the county level. So I can pull the exact number, but I don't think much changed since what we promoted in March. Can you refresh my memory with that number. I have a number in my head, but I'm not sure if that's right. I can pull it up for you right now. Thank you. And then while you're looking for that, another question, because I'm just trying to get a grasp of where we are with the end goal, which is making sure that we get people in jobs long term. So if we look at the numbers where you have jobs posted, then we have the numbers of who was placed and then stayed after a year. And then if I go on the budget book and look at, for example, the number of people that visited the work center, looking at 2024, for example, we see like over 10,000 people visited the work center. Then we have about 1075, let's say 1700 jobs posted, 220 estimate placements. Right. So that just seems like a big gap between the amount of people that are coming in looking for employment, the amount of jobs posted, and the actual amount of people placed. And so just what could we do to help bridge that gap from the amount of people that are actually entering, actually leaving with a job? And what can we do from a council perspective to assist you in that? No, that's great. I think the number that we're looking at, and I have to take more time, twelve is the last pathways to government number that we have. Thank you, Jeff. Let's make sure we circle back after the hearing to make sure we get the most accurate. Related to that number we talked about in the last hearing was data. Again, this is our first full year utilizing the system that you all funded, which is the virtual career center in years past where we want to bring. So we use the job centers like a WeWork model. Nonprofits, community based organizations can get access to these centers. And it gives them an address, it gives them support staff, things of that sort. It also opens the door to other government agencies. They're not only the people that we fund are mandated to use our system. Everybody else was using their own system. And then we were using the state labor exchange, which doesn't allow, because Maryland labor controls, that doesn't allow them. So we can track who comes into the center, what happens after. If they. Now, we are one of the largest partners in the center, of course. But if they go to a nonprofit or they go to Maryland Department of Labor, we only get what they agree to give us. Now, with the virtual career center and our atlas, we can now give a free resource to nonprofits and government agencies so that they can agree to track what we hope and what we've talked to OMB, and what we hope to bring eventually to the council and the county execs office is that we can get every nonprofit that receives county funding to track those outcomes in the system. It allow us to show our investments, it's allowed to show the outcomes. But right now, what you see is what we can track, not the. Every single partner in there. And, I mean, we could say that with your discounted lease space, you have to report it. But then we run the risk of an organization not using the center, and then kind of. We're kind of in that chicken or the egg, where if they leave, the community leaves a resource, or if they don't have the capacity to track it, we don't have a funding mechanism to give them that capacity. But this is the first year, ending in June 30 that we will have the virtual career center. We've been talking with the staff of getting those numbers, and we should be able to start seeing that change, of getting a true number of not just seeing who walks through the center, which we checked from that, but actually seeing which nonprofit served who. What was the outcome? Did they refer it? And then we've got a couple of government agencies that have also agreed they're going to have to do dual data entry, but we've agreed to share the data, could help them with grant revenue fundraising, but eventually, we would like to see every partner in the center provide that programmatic data and no", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Employ Prince George's", "insights": [{"observation": "Coming out of Annapolis there may be an additional adjustment in the budget for Employ Prince George's as there was a program that we believe may give a little more resources.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Prince George's County Reentry Employment Incentive Fund", "insights": [{"observation": "I wanted to start with the reentry program that you guys have with the incentives in the private sector.

So I guess the big thing that we would look at is a long term conversation of having all of those entities that receive funding. So everybody that we get county funding from, and we give them funding, we mandate they use the system as a part of their funding from us, those that are getting county funding, but the funding is not coming through us. We can't mandate it. We'd like to have a discussion on utilizing a central resource so that we could track referrals. We could track outcomes, because a big piece of sharing referrals, if they need food, right, if they're going to a food pantry, they probably don't have sufficient funds to get it from a grocery store. That person should be referred to a job center or an employment program. Same thing with light and utility assistance, same thing with diaper banks. How do we make sure that we can't have people follow through the system through that referral? And how do we make sure we can track those outcomes? Right now in the system, we have 84 entities who have signed up to use the system. Of course, 84 is a small percentage of the total resources in the county. So that is a long term conversation that we hope would basically be able to better track, show outcomes and make sure the residents are getting connected to those resources. And then maybe, like, offline, we could follow up, I guess take that number out. Right. The job center, because it's so many other entities. But maybe look at all of just the training, everything that's just specifically employed, Prince George, is that you have control over. So we can see the base number of people that are working with you for employment versus the base number of jobs and the base number of individuals. So then we can kind of see to your point. It's not perfect, but a ratio that's more accurate on, like, where the gap is. And then my last question is, I know, and thank you for the commitment. Cause we talked about you guys working more with the homeless shelter, specifically with the men's shelter, which you guys have, but some of them have come because they feel like they're not able to get jobs right now. Right. And, like, that's been, like, the disconnect. It's like a lot of maybe training or go through this program or that program. So do we have something in place that is focused on, like, immediate, rapid employment that we know for those people that are dealing, like, with homelessness and are unhoused, that. I know it might not be the perfect career path, but they're looking for a job right now to get them out of their circumstances. Yeah, that's something that, you know, I think that's part of the relationship. You brought that to us. You brought that concern. How do we fix it? I'm happy to say last week, our solution is really to that immediate. Right. Is staffing and temp opportunities. So we actually put a call out via email, social media, our direct mailers, to really engage staffing agents in the region. We had 20 staffing agencies show up. We had 54 invites. 20 entities showed up, which showed us that those are the 20 entities that want to work with Prince George's county. We have a follow up meeting, and we have a follow up meeting scheduled next month. But the goal of that, those 20 agencies, is to sort them by industry and to get them hopefully at least one day or every three days, maybe two times per week. I'd like to see them five days a week in one of our locations, including the mobile unit where we go to the men's shelter. We're providing those immediate hiring opportunities. Now we're going to have to do the career readiness on our side, but I think and based on what you expressed, bringing the. Instead of just going with traditional employees, bringing the temp and temporary and staffing agencies into the job center, which is not traditionally a number that we would want to track because they're. They're there and they got to come back and they're back and forth. But for that population, we think that's the solution. We've had 20 entities show up our follow up. Our next step is getting them enrolled in that virtual tool so we can send the referrals, getting them registered, and they agreed to a follow up training in May. I mean, I'm very hopeful that that is going to be helping with that direct placement. And we can invite whoever wants to attend to that may meeting as well. But for that issue, we believe that is going to be close to. I mean, that's the best solution we have at the point. That's exactly what I was thinking. And so I'm so glad that you guys were already there and moving in that direction. So just, again, thank you for that work and trying to think about. Okay, this isn't working. What can work? So I just appreciate that. Definitely. Thank you. Thank you, council member Oriata. Mister Simmons, I got three quick questions. Out of 30,000 lost, is there any way that knowing where that workforce was in the county, can you break that down by district?

So I just appreciate that. Definitely. Thank you. Thank you, council member Oriata. Mister Simmons, I got three quick questions. Out of 30,000 lost, is there any way that knowing where that workforce was in the county, can you break that down by district? We can't. For that specific 30,000. No, of that. We can compare unemployment by district compared to date as best as census tract data. We can provide that, but it won't be a direct match. Okay. And then for. I'm looking at your budget, so it's more administrative here for operating. I noticed a decline of 62.1% in your participant support services. But I know an. I see an increase in and other of 541%. Can you speak directly to that? It sounds like you kind of reorganizing there about how those services should be going out. Well, I mean, the big thing that we try to do is bring in dollars and not come to you all as much. As much. Mister early, key word isn't as much. We still want to come back, but because of that, we are subject to what our funders want to fund. Of course, we know Arpa has gone away. We also know that we were at 12.9% unemployment. We down to 2%. We know that that doesn't take into account the 30,000 that's left. But that is a substantial amount of support. And then also the budget cuts from the county budget this year. What you see on the opposite is blueprint came in with a bang, about $6 million. So that's where you see. And so what we're trying to do now, it's moved around. But Jeff, our CFO, brought it to me. He said, we're a youth serving organization now, Walter, you know, a large percent of our budget has gone from adult to youth. What we're doing and what Mister early mentioned is now trying to supplant that. So big news out of Annapolis. $200,000 to renovate the youth career center and reentry center at Suitland. That's coming to us also. The first rent court workforce program in Prince George's county. We partner with Montgomery county, so we can't predict them from getting evicted. But eviction is the, is an issue. The problem is people don't have money. So now we do have 600,000 that's been allocated that's gonna go to Montgomery workforce and Prince George's. And we will have a workforce person in rent court now starting next year. And that means that everybody that goes through rent court, we're gonna engage with them and say, hey, you know, I understand you're getting evicted. We can't prevent that. But let's work with you to increase your income so you can break this cycle of poverty. We also have a heavy equipment operator funding coming from Annapolis. We also are wokest on a leasing training agent funding that's coming from Annapolis. So we're going, we also have several grants that we put into this. I see apprenticeship building America, women in non traditional occupations. So we're going to try to, we can't, you know, that's a large chunk of funding that is going away. And we're going to try to work with these external sources to bring funding back to really supplant that. And that's that where you see one area leaving and one area increasing is just based on the fundraising and development. So thank you for answering that. I kind of assumed that, but I just wanted for people that are watching in the public might not have a chance to ask that question I'm looking at, and I don't want to assume, but when I see total direct program expenses, and then I think about targeting and micro targeting and making sure that we get the word out to capture this 30,000 lost. What are we spending on marketing expenses that your total direct program expenses, our marketing expenses is very minimum to the overall budget. Okay. Only because of most of our money and through our contract log that we sent over in the second round, most of the contracts are for skills upgrading. So when you hear a lot of free training across the region, across the county, it's not all free. I'm just trying to figure out how we get you on Pandora and YouTube. It's expensive. We want to radio because it's expensive. We want to. But it. We use probably less than 2% of our budget on. On marketing. The majority of the funding is going to that. Skills upgrading wages, subsidizing the wages for people that might not look like a traditional good fit for an employer. We subsidize them for up to twelve weeks. And then the training. On average, we spend at least $5,000 per scholarship. Okay. The reason why I asked that, because I know we're in highly competitive jurisdiction with everyone around us trying to focus on jobs. And I do know that we were the leader in job creation before COVID And so my question would be, and maybe you can get that information to me offline.

All right. Works for me. Thank you. That pretty much is my last question. Madam Chair, do you have a question? Since you asked, I just wanted to thank you for your partnership with the consolidated storage facility on 450. Really looking forward to that. Being up and running. I was so happy that that space is going to be able to be put to that use. I know that the community will also get to use it as well. But what better use than to bring jobs and job services closer to the people? So, thank you for that. Thank you. Thank you for the referral. All of your referrals. So, Mister Simmons, you're off the hot seat now. You did your thing. We appreciate you. You spent about 2 hours with us about three weeks ago, and so we appreciate all you're doing to move us forward. So thank you. So next we have the board of education. FY 2024 financial review and transfer request. I guess this is the second one. Mister Albeer. Good afternoon and thank you again. Good afternoon and thank you again. Please welcome the Board of Education Chief Financial Officer Lisa Howell and David Noto will provide an overview of this transfer request and turn it over to Lisa afterwards. Good afternoon again, members of the Education Workforce Development Committee. Again, my name is David Noto and I will provide a brief overview of the fiscal year 2024 Board of Education Transfer Request Board of Education requests approval of an alteration of the fiscal year 2024 operating budget. The operating budget would remain at $2,813,515,115. The breakdown of the allocation runs as follows. This budget transfer would repurpose $43,563,676 in unrestricted spending drawn predominantly from instructional salaries due to salary lapses and $32,016,472 in restricted funding, and put that towards balancing charter allocations based on final fiscal year 2024 per pupil allocation and paying off two lease agreements. Purchase agreements early. These lease agreements originally supported the purchase of buses, textbooks and technology in fiscal year 2021 and 2022. The early payoff of these agreements reduces the liability in the fiscal year 2025 and 2026 operating budget, helping to cover the cost of phase two of the public private partnership. Increases in both electricity and water and sewer prices from the previous year in supporting part time and overtime due to systemic operations, vacancies and early payment of the fiscal year 2025 portion of the annual contribution towards other post employment benefits, such as health and life insurance. In this early payment. The intent is not to make any additional contributions to the OPEB in fiscal year 2025. You'll find more in depth information on the shifts in funding in the report found in your virtual binder on page three. Thank you. And if you have further questions about the transfer request, I can take them at this time or I can pass them off to Miss Howe. Thank you for that thorough report. I don't have anything additional to add to that. Thank you. Miss Howe. Mister early, I just wanted to say we are fully in support. Okay. Council member bligue. Okay. So I wanted to get clarity on the p three just to make sure I understand. So right now, I see that we have. So we're only giving 13 million right now. What? Can you explain the payment for the p three s in the building of the school? I would like to know, and of course, just make sure that we understand that it's coming out of operating versus capital, all of that. Sure. The financial review that you have in front of you is the second one for this fiscal year, and it's as of our December close, and it's based off of where we were when we started the financial review process, we reflected in our proposed budget for 2025 that in a measure to help close our 25 budget gap, that we were going to pay early part of the P three commitment for fiscal year 2025. As you know, through the legislative process, changes have now been made where that funding will be made by the county directly into the P three fund. But at the time that this financial review went through the process, this was still the plan up until literally within the last couple weeks where this change came out of Annapolis. So what we intend to do, and we'll have to come back in our third financial review, which is on the docket for the May meeting, is we will likely realign that savings to pay off more lease purchase payments, more lease purchase agreements early because we still have a budget gap in 25 that we have to solve for. So we will no longer be making that payment towards P three, but we'll have to come back and do another financial review because it's in a different functional category. But that's the current request that you have in front of you because that's where we were when this financial review began.

But that's the current request that you have in front of you because that's where we were when this financial review began. I want to come back when I just, I know others have questions. Yeah. Councilmember Hawkins, mister chair, I move favorable on this budget, so I'll second that motion and then we'll open up for discussion. Councilmember oriata yeah, I just want to circle back to, I think, the question that councilmember bligue was asking just for clarity because I'm also not clear on where the money's coming from and what's needed. So just a recap of what I understand, and correct me if I'm wrong on something and interject where needed. There was around 30 million. I know that number is not accurate. I believe that we were told would now have to come out of the operating budget instead of the capital improvement budget for P three s. And we were told that that wasn't necessarily planned for. Then we were told that that money was going to come out of the county budget in some way, shape or form so it wouldn't impact the operating budget. Then we're told, no, that wasn't going to happen anymore. Then we were told that there was part of the legislation they have on the state level with the telecommunications tax that was supposed to make up some of the difference, which wasn't clear if that was money for P three, if it was just the money to make up the difference from blueprint. And now here we are. Right. And so I think for some of our colleagues, we're just not sure in what was actually agreed to where the money's coming from. Is there a deficit? Because there's been a lot said from both parties, and we never got clarity in the general assembly about what was with the telecommunications council member orator. I know Mister early has his team ready to answer that question, so. Mister early. So there are several pieces of question here, but basically what's happened is in the Indianapolis, there was a decision made that the funding for the P three would be separated out between, you know, there'd no longer be a three way split. It would be the county and the state, as opposed to the county, state and board of education. The. So these were two separate. Two separate things going on that were parallel. And Erica can help me if I get off track here. So we had a change in regard to the taxes, that the energy tax and the telecommunications tax would no longer be on top of the blueprint, but that the county would be responsible for all of the second. So what will happen? So this is one part of that. The other piece, which you will see, which is separate from what's in your book here, when we get to the next part, which is the review of the board of education budget, is we will be proposing later on that the 27, I think it's $32 million that's in the board of education budget as it sits right now, will come out, will go into the county's budget to pay for exactly the same thing. So what's happened? County's paying for it. So what's happened is basically the board's being cut out of the payment process, and that's really what this is all about. And there's lots of details, but that's really what this is all about. So, mister early, so basically you're saying that county's responsible for paying that payment. I'm saying the county is responsible for paying the payment. Okay, thank you, council member bligue. And that's just. I just want to clarify. That's just for the second payment. That doesn't include the future. Right? What about the future? No, that's for. No, that's for the second p three, including the second payment. Okay. Including the future. Not the p three that's already in existence. Got it. But the new p three is the county is paying all of it. Just the county and state. Just the county and state. Okay. And because we took board of education out of it, does that change our obligation? Like, it doesn't change our obligation. It doesn't change the. It moves around but the bottom line is the total amount of money stays the same, and the total amount of money, this total amount of money, plays the same. It's just instead of paying the board to pay the state and paying part of it directly from us, we're paying all of it. Okay. And let me just say this. I think the bigger issue is that how does that impact the rest of the funding for our kids? Like, the programming, all of that stuff. Can you explain how much does that take away from the actual programming that we have set for our children? For our kids? In regard to the p three, it has no effect. I mean, we could talk about the taxes and all that kind of stuff, but in regard to the p three, what was going to happen is money was going to be paid by the state, the county, and the board of education for what's called a, what do you call it? Payment for the ongoing availability payment. And that number was. I can't remember the exact number, but let's say it's 64 or 69 million, whatever that number is, it stays exactly the same. It's just the flow is different. Got it. Okay. And that's fine. And I do. Just another quick question. Since we're doing the budget overall, can you talk about sort of.

We've been hearing complaints about, like, 30 kids per classroom, that type of thing. Now with the budget part, have we put forth money to make sure that we have extended numbers of teachers so we could start to bring that number down per classroom? I think that I would defer that question to the board of education, and I also think that really belong. I'm not trying to be difficult, but I really do think that's separate from the immediate question of what's happening in 24. Okay, that's fine. Thank you, council member Bougue, councilmember Oriato. I know you want to finish up with some points. Yeah. Just one more thing. Since we're moving that cost over from the county side, where are we making up the difference to pay for that portion? Where is it? Did we just pull it from the general fund? Did it come from somewhere else? Where did we get the amount to keep that cost? We're reducing the amount of money that's going to the board, moving the money into an account, probably an account. We have to currently have an account where we're paying the first P three in non departmental. We will add this 31, $32 million to that, and we'll pay the bill there. So it's really literally moving it from the board instead of it being appropriated to the board to pay the bill. It's being going to be appropriated directly to pay the bill ourselves. So we're removing the 32, roughly the $32 million from the Board of education budget to pay for it out of the county budget. So was the 32. I guess this is where I get confused, because when they came before the superintendent, before, what he said was that that 32 million was never in his budget to be spent on the p three. So if he didn't have it. So that means if it was in their original budget at that time, at least when he came before us, that $32 million was supposed to be spent on something different. And now the 32 million, if it is taken out, would have some type of impact. Again, this is just off of what he said to the body. I can't entirely speak to that, but I can say that the board of education budget, as presented by the county, had 32 million in change for going to the board to pay for. To pay for the P three. That's what's in the budget that was submitted to the council. What we are saying we will do is we will move that 32 million over to non departmental and we will pay for it the same number of dollars flowing to the same people. There won't be any change from what the county has submitted. Thank you, councilmember orator. Just to be clear, Mister early, you kind of confused a couple of people when you were talking about. Because we have the budget, operating budget next, and we're not voting on the operating budget, we're voting on a transfer. So let me be clear to my colleagues, what is exactly happening. And Mister early had mentioned earlier that the county will be making the payment. Yes on that. Also, Mister Ellie, correct me if I'm wrong. The money we're talking about, prior to all the changes and challenges and the misunderstanding, it was money the county was paying to the school board or to the school system. And as a result of working with the general assembly, instead of the money going to the school system, it's going directly to the state. Correct? Directly into the project. Yes. Yeah. Thank you, Mister Hawkins. So, colleagues, we're going to close down discussion now. There's been a motion made by councilmember Hawkins, the second by myself, chair of education workforce development. We just had discussion, we closed it down. So. Madam Clerk, please call the roll. Chair Harrison? I vote aye. Vice chair Watson? Vote. I. Council member blickade? Aye. Council member Hawkins? Madam Clerk? I vote aye. Council member Oriada? Abstain. Motion carries, 40 one. Thank you so much, Madam Clerk. Thank you, so next we're going to move on now to the board of education operating budget. Mister Albeer, you're up. You'll pass it over to David? Yeah. All right. Good afternoon, council members. Once again, my name is Irene Albear, director of the Education and Workforce Development Committee, and I will be presenting a brief overview of the Board of Education's fiscal year 2025 operating budget.

The increase in fiscal year 2025 is primarily due to cost of living adjustments and step increases for staff, together with the addition of 108 positions due to formula driven requirements for student and school based budgeting.

Thank you. Thank you. Please introduce yourself. My name is Nicholas Worrell from the National Transportation Safety Board and I want to talk today a little bit about the pedestrian safety concerns. NTSB appreciates the opportunity to provide some information regarding a special investigation report on pedestrian safety and especially on our call for the increased use of pedestrian safety action plans. We hope that the information I provide today can be helpful in convening the school pedestrian safety workgroup. My agency, the NTSB, investigate accidents and crashes in all modes of transportation, aviation, railroad, pipeline, highway and commercial space. We also conduct studies concerning transportation safety, such as our special investigative report on pedestrian safety. The recommendations we issue based on our investigation and studies are our most important product for saving lives. A lot of the report recommendations focus on infrastructure. My personal shorthand we teach our children to look both ways before crossing the streets, but we must also give them crosswalks and crossing guards to support. We published a report in 2018 of special investigative report after the 2016 Pedestrian Safety Public Forum and TSP, where experts discuss data, designs and technology, and after we investigate a dozen fatal pedestrian crashes. And one of the reports we issued eleven safety recommendations and we urge the Federal Highway Safety Administration to promote municipal pedestrian safety action plans that develop a network of safety improvements, local pedestrian safety action plans. They seek to improve and cooperate pedestrians and transportation networks. The objective of pedestrian safety action plans are to establish risk assessment frameworks, identify data requirement for selecting and evaluating actions, and prioritize countermeasures for increasing safety. The publication how to develop a pedestrian safety action plan is available at the federal Highway Administration. It's called for analyzed safety data, seeking public input and coordinating the planning process. It recommends engaging with citizen groups, local public agencies, effective private sector interests and the media, as well as coordinating other local plans. Our findings recognize that effective street designs for pedestrian safety are highly context dependent and should be managed by local interests. However, states and cities would benefit from resources, tools, funding, support to develop and implement effective plans. The design guidance need to develop effective pedestrian safety action plans is readily available to local transportation planners. Addressing the pedestrian safety design changes needed for many of the urban environment will take substantially more resources, and I hope this information is valuable to the committee as you move forward with putting together your work group for pedestrian safety. Thank you. Thank you so much.

Thank you. Thank you so much. Next we'll have second reading of Bill's introduction CB Zero Zero 720 24 an act concerning the revised elderly property tax credit for the purpose of revising the current elderly property tax credit to make its applicability exclusive of and separate and distinct from the homestead and Maryland homeowners property tax credit. We will go to council member Watson for a GOFP report. Thank you, Madam chair. The Prince George's County Council's government operations and fiscal policy committee convened on March 14, 2024 to consider CB Zero zero 720 24. CB seven is an act concerning an elderly property tax credit which revises the current elderly property tax credit to make its applicability exclusive, separate and distinct from the homestead and Maryland homeowners property tax credits. Committee staff provided an overview of the bill and background for the legislation, including comparisons to surrounding jurisdictions, qualification requirements, the duration of residence, income and or assessed value limits, and other requirements that could mitigate the fiscal impact. The bill, as drafted will authorize individuals to receive the credit if they are at least 65 years old and have lived in their home for a minimum of ten years and the home's assessed value is less than 500,000. The projected cost is $11,120,634. In tax credits granted annually. The maximum value shall increase annually on July 1 by the lesser of the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year, or 3%. The credit shall be granted each year for a period of up to five years if the individual remains eligible for the credits. The sponsor of the legislation, councilmember Burroughs, reminded the committee that CB 29 2022 passed unanimously establishing a 20% reduction of property tax. A provision in CB 29 requires that the credit is inclusive of any homestead or homeowners tax credit provided, which caused many residents not to benefit from the credit. CV seven removes that requirement and will allow many more senior residents to qualify. Public comments from 22 members of the committee were heard and over 100 attended. Everyone who testified expressed support for the tax credits enactment during the council members discussion, proposals to change the eligibility from ten years to 20 years and changes to the qualifications to include income instead of assessed value or not accepted. Council members expressed concern about the impact on the budget and a desire to keep the promise made when CB 29 2022 was enacted. The county executive's liaison reminded the committee that the executive was in support of CB 29 2022, the initial tax credit legislation. The liaison asked that the members reconsider the methodology for qualification for the credits used in this bill to avoid unintended consequences and decrease the fiscal impact. The administration does not feel that considering our budget deficit and the way that the legislation is drafted will provide the support that seniors expect. The county executive took no position on the legislation as drafted. The government operations and Fiscal policy committee reported CB 720 24 out favorably. Five to zero. That concludes my report. Thank you. CB zero zero. 720 24 stands introduced. Madam Chair, because council members Harrison and Bligh are not here, we will need to remove them as sponsors. I just wanted to state that for the record. Okay, thank you. Next, we have CB 10 20 24, an act concerning mental health and firearms safety literature for the purpose of requiring the Department of Health and human services to prepare and distribute certain literature to establishments that sell firearms or ammunition adding certain display and distribution requirements for sellers of firearms or ammunition authorizing enforcement by the Department of Health and Human Services making a civil violation for non compliance and generally relating to public safety. This is sponsored by council member Oriata and we'll have a committee report from council member Fisher. Thank you, Madam Chair. The Health and Human Services and Public Safety Committee convened on March 21, 2024 to consider CB 1020 24. The bill requires the Department of Health to create and disseminate specific literature to businesses selling firearms or ammunition, and I believe there are about six that are identified in the county. The literature pertains to gun and firearm safety, gun and firearm training, suicide prevention, mental health and conflict resolution. The sellers are to suppose signs on the premises where such transactions occur and distribute them to all individuals who purchase firearms or ammunition. The Department of Health has the authority to enforce regulation and failure to comply will consist of a civil violation and that may result into a fine up to $100 or $1,000 I think it's supposed to be. The legislative budget and policy analyst provide an overview of the bill and details on the fiscal impact. Further, when enacted, CB 1024 may have a favorable indirect impact on the county if successfully reduces the overall number of suicide attempts occurring in the county, which would reduce the workload of our police, fire and other emergency services to respond to such attempts.

Bill's sponsor, Councilmember Oriada indicated that this legislation is vital considering the concerning statistics regarding suicide rates. Sikhinda Skinner, the county council liaison for the Office of the county Executive, indicated the administration supports and that they will they are doing all they can to reduce gun violence and educate about mental health issues. The Skinner further explained that the Department of Health can handle items three, four and five listed on page two of the bill related to suicide prevention, mental health and conflict resolution. However, on page one, items one and two, firearm safety and firearm training don't fall under the purview of the health department. The current state requirement dictates that gun shops must furnish literature to all individuals purchasing guns or ammunition. The health department doesn't seem to have the expertise in firearm safety and training. Therefore, the department would not necessarily be the best agency to produce literature on the topics were her statements. In response to Miss Skinner's concerns, the chief legislative attorney further clarified the bill's intent, which did not involve generating new content, but rather organizing information about existing resources. Chief legislative attorney discussed the amendments and added language about gun ranges to the distribution to the list of distributors and added Mister Grant Cofield to the title. As he is. This bill is named after him and his family. All of the amendments were voted individually and passed with a vote of 40. After discussion, the Health and Human Services and Public Safety committee voted for zero favorably as amended on CB 10 20 24. Thank you so much. Are there any additional sponsors?

Thank you. Good afternoon, madam chair and council members. I am Shannon Mouton, and I serve as the executive director for Laurel advocacy and referral services. I'm here today in support of the rent stabilization extension. Lars continues to distribute thousands and thousands of dollars each month in eviction prevention funds to keep families from becoming homeless. Rent stabilization, without a doubt, keeps people from becoming homeless. However, it is not a long term solution. And while we do support the rent stabilization extension, be very clear. Lars is asking this council to do all within your power to expedite development of affordable housing throughout the entire county for all residents. Thank you for your time. I know that you mean well, but you actually can't clap during council. But thank you so much. Ryan Washington, Lauren Boucher, and then Ariana Elons. Thank you, madam chair, members of the committee, for the record, my name is Ryan Washington with the apartment office Building association. And just to echo miss Mouton's comments, there is a housing supply shortage in the state of Maryland and, of course, across the region. And Maryland has a 96,000 housing unit deficit. This past legislative session, the governor and the state have taken great action in terms of addressing that through legislation to increase more housing density and affordable units throughout the state. To address this and to address housing affordability, however, rent control is legislation that only puts a band aid on a systemic issue that's dealing with supply and demand. In addition, the impacts of this 3% temporary rent cap will have very, very negative economic impacts on behalf of our members, as rent is a sole revenue collected as a form to help pay for operating expenses.

And just to echo miss Mouton's comments, there is a housing supply shortage in the state of Maryland and, of course, across the region. And Maryland has a 96,000 housing unit deficit. This past legislative session, the governor and the state have taken great action in terms of addressing that through legislation to increase more housing density and affordable units throughout the state. To address this and to address housing affordability, however, rent control is legislation that only puts a band aid on a systemic issue that's dealing with supply and demand. In addition, the impacts of this 3% temporary rent cap will have very, very negative economic impacts on behalf of our members, as rent is a sole revenue collected as a form to help pay for operating expenses. Mortgage insurance, which has increased over 20% for the past two years. In addition, with the insurgents of legislative mandates, including building energy performance standards, which will require housing providers to retrofit their existing infrastructure with more energy efficient mechanisms of infrastructure. Regarding a study that we conducted with the Stephen Winters associates, BEPs would cost community with a one bedroom in Maryland to comply with state mandates. It will cost one bedroom, about $60 per square unit, which would equate to $42,000 for one bedroom. In addition, for a two bedroom, it would cost about 60,000 altogether for that one unit. So these costs are adding compounded in terms of trying to be in compliance. However, it will be difficult financially and feasible for our members to continue operate if they're hampered with such cost and only allowed to increase rent at such a low cap. That's why we submit our comments and you have our written testimony in opposition to this bill. Thank you. Thank you. Lauren Boucher, Ariana Evans and then Clyde Hargraves. Hello. I'm going to speak quickly because I have a lot to get through. Good afternoon, my name is. Hang on 1 second. We need to reset the clock for you. There you go. You have three minutes. All right. Thank you so much. Good afternoon. My name is Lauren Busher and I've been a resident of Prince George's county for approximately nine years. I'm a member of Casa and a part of the Peachey County Housing justice coalition. I'm here today to discuss my experiences as a renter and to support both the temporary rental cap extension and to urge the council to work toward fair permanent rent stabilization for PG County. I want to take a moment to talk about my experiences as a renter in PG county. In November of 2023, I and several other residents of the Westgate at Laurel, owned by Schweb Partners, were victims of a plumbing flood. Over a two week period, my apartment was flooded no less than four times with sewage water from a bad pipe. I was displaced from my home for a total of 23 days while repairs were made. Having been a renter all my life, I realized that accidents and maintenance emergencies happen. All of that I could excuse except for two things. My apartment previously flooded in 2021 from this same issue, and to make amends for what happened, I was given less than $700 as a rental concession. $700 isn't even enough to cover rent for the days that I was displaced, not to mention the extra burden of having to ask friends and family for living assistance, as well as the emotional and psychological trauma of being without a home during the holiday season. To make matters worse, the flooding issue only scratches the surface of the maintenance issues I've experienced in this apartment complex. All the while, my rent has increased nearly $200 since 2021. The county is worried that landlords won't invest into their properties if there's rent stabilization. While I have news they already don't invest into their properties, maintenance issues go unaddressed. Yet landlords want free reign to raise rent as much as they want. When we, the renters, brought the issue of rent stabilization to the PG County Council in 2022, the landlords, shareholders and ayoba painted an apocalyptic picture of the economic future of Maryland. Rental caps and vacancy control, they said, would be debilitating for landlords and prevent or discourage investors from purchasing further properties. Well, I'd like to bring to your attention a few new stories of interest. I only have a couple of minutes left. This is from the Winston Salem Journal. This was published in March 8 of 2022, when all of this discussion was going on about rental caps, a New Jersey investment firm has paid a combined 72.53 million to purchase three older Winston Salem apartment complexes. The purchases were made separately by three affiliates of Schweb Partners, LLC of Jackson Township, New Jersey. Okay, that's fine. Give them some time to invest into these properties. Right? Fast forward to February 6 of 2023. Almost a year later, Mayor Sarno on Springfield Garden properties I've had it with them. In their hollow words. Springfield Mayor Dominic Sarno has issued a statement after 25 families were forced out of their homes after a massive fire in the north end of Springfield last month. The fire took place at Springfield Gardens. Sarno stated that the fire was attributed to squatters due to a lack of security for their property. Miss Busher, I'm so sorry, but your time is up. Thank you so much. Thank you. Ariana Evans I believe that says, I think you're going to be a doctor in your next life based on your figure handwriting. All of my teachers have told me my handwriting is interesting. Hi, my name is Ariana Evans.

All of my friends and cool people call me a feeny, though, and I come here before you today once again to lend my support for the extension of the Temporary Civilization Act 2024. Over a year ago, I testified in front of this council advocating for the enactment of this crucial legislation, and I'm heartened to see the positive impact that has had in our community since its implementation. Throughout the past year, we've heard concerns from landlords and property managers who feared that the Rent Stabilization act would threaten their ability to operate. However, despite these concerns, we have witnessed them continue to conduct business as usual, demonstrating that reasonable limitations on rent increases have not hindered their operations. In fact, this legislation has helped strike the balance between the needs of tenants and the entrance of property owners, fostering a more equitable rental market for all. As the director of organizing for Life after release and a member of the Prince George's County Housing Justice Coalition. I have seen firsthand the impact of stable housing on individuals transitioning from incarceration. People who are incarcerated are ten times more likely to be unhoused, and unhoused people are eleven times more likely to be incarcerated. And it's also important to emphasize that 70% of Maryland's prison population are black people. So this is an issue of public safety and racial equity. For many, access to affordable housing is a linchpin in their journey towards successful integration into society. By extending the sunset provision of the Rent Stabilization act for an additional six months, we have the opportunity to continue providing essential support to those in our community who need it most. Let us not lose sight of the progress we've made in addressing homelessness and housing insecurity in Prince George's county. Let us stand firm in our commitment to ensuring that everyone has access to safe and affordable housing. And by extending this critical legislation, we affirm our dedication to building a more just and equitable future for all members of our community. Of our community. Thank you so much for your time and consideration. My name is Afini, and. Yeah, that's me. Thank you, Athena. Next we have Clyde Hargraves and then Audrey Johnson. Good afternoon. My name is Bishop Clyde L. Hargraves, and I live in district ward now. And I've been there for approximately, I mean, 14 years or more. And it is unfortunately that all of a sudden my rent was increased by $300 per month. Being a retired person and then also being a veteran, in other words, who's disabled and being on that fixed income, to receive this $300 month increase is extremely radical for me now. I love it. That's the reason why I'm still here. But this is the first time this has happened to me since I've been living in this particular county. But I want you to know that I am so thankful and pleased by nature. The fact that it was brought more vividly clear to me when I entered the environment in terms of responding to what was going on by way of member Crystal Oriata. And the piece that we need now is the 3% rental stabilization extended piece. Not only extended, but we are demanding a permanent 3% stabilization law for all of Prince George's County. I would simply like to say that while we in this county didn't realize such a radical increase was coming, but we have you all who are in place to help better protect us and not allow things like this to sneak up on us or slip up on us unless something else is involved. So I'm here today to tell you right now, if we don't get it, I have to take it to the clergy brothers that I. I am affiliated with. And the piece, and the thing of it is this, if you're not here to help take better care of us, the question is here, why are you here, other than salary wise? But we don't want to think of it on that particular order. We want to think of it in terms of, by nature, the fact that I go back to the civil rights struggle movement and everything. It is nothing that we can't do for each other. That needs to be done. Thank you. Thank you. Next we have Audrey Johnson. Yes. Napping is also included. I'm okay if you do the sign language thing, but no noise, please. Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Audrey Johnson. Audrey L. Johnson. I had a speech written for me, but I need to speak in my own words. I live at Charlestown north apartments in Greenbelt, Maryland. Our property was inherent. We were inherited by slumlords. They promptly took over the building and did nothing else except collect rent. Before the stabilization act took effect, they were raising residents rents, three and $400. When they renewed their leases, we had a mass exodus of neighbors who could not afford the increase. Okay, so they raised the rent, but then they didn't do anything else except collect rent. After the stabilization act came into effect, they decided, oh, well, we can't get a whole bunch of money. Let's charge them for utilities that were included in our lease. They had no kind of notice, and they wanted to do rubs, but they didn't go through the procedure that's necessary to implement rubs. I really, really appreciate Ingrid Watson.

You're doing great, but you have 50 seconds left. Josue Salmaran, the city manager, came and he stepped in also. The building is now in receivership. I'm asking for permanent rent stabilization because everybody's trying to recover, still recovering from the pandemic. People have lost salaries. They haven't been brought back up to their original salaries. And the price of everything is increasing, and it's only making things harder, and I'm hoping that everybody involved will vote yes for making rent stabilization permanent. Thank you. Thank you so much. Miss Johnson, I'm going to make you a doctor as well, because I also couldn't read your handwriting. Oh, okay, great. All right, let's see. Where are we? Well, we have had the hearing for CB eight. Is there a motion to enact? Motion enact. Motion is made by council member Oreada, second by councilmember Fisher, and I would like to remind everyone that this requires eight votes because it is an emergency bill. Madam Clerk, please call the roll chair. Ivey? Aye. Mister Burroughs? Mister Dunoga? Aye. Miss Fisher? Aye. Mister Franklin? Mister Franklin. I vote aye. Vote aye. Mister Hawkins, where's the preacher? I vote aye. Mister Olson? Aye. Miss Oyela? I vote aye. And just take a moment to explain my vote. I just want to thank my colleagues for their support on this and all the work that we're doing behind the scenes to bring permanent rent stabilization together to move it forward, and thanking everyone for attending today. Miss Watson? I vote aye. And I just want to thank Miss Audrey for her kind words. Thank you. Motion carries 90. Thank you. CB eight passes. Next. Yes, you have to teach everybody how to do the sign language class. Next, we have public hearings, bills eligible for third reading enactment, which is CB 13, 2024, an ordinance concerning cannabis uses for the purpose of adding definitions and designating areas for cannabis uses consistent with authority set forth in state law prohibiting on site cannabis consumption uses, setting forth regulations for permitted cannabis uses, providing for the prospective application of provisions and amendments adopted herein, and providing a severability clause for the provisions related to cannabis uses in Prince George's county. Sponsored by council members Fisher, Bligue, Watson, Olson, Ivy, Harrison, Oreada, Durnoga, Hawkins, Burroughs, and Franklin. Is there. Are there any speakers? I will say that CB 13 draft. Oh, there is a speaker. It was actually on the back of the speaker's list that you just received. I'm so sorry. Yes, we have Eddie Pounds. Thank you, madam chair. Good afternoon, madam chair and council members. For the record, Eddie pounds with Perry White, Ross and Jake Jacobson. I'm here today on behalf of the cannabis companies. It's a local cannabis dispensary operator that has been looking for a site to locate its dispensary in Prince George's county for more than two years now. In fact, they've looked at over 200 sites and have struck out each time for various reasons, primarily due to zoning restrictions, but also due to another reason that we run into which is a rejection by the property owner because the property owner can't take on the use due to their financing obligations. Because as we know, cannabis is still a schedule one drug. I'd like to just simply say thank you to councilmember Fisher for sponsoring, initially sponsoring this bill. As many of you recall, I testified at subcommittee. But I also want to thank all of you for co sponsoring the bill. This is really a piece of legislation which isn't about getting people high, it's about economic development, providing economic development, economic justice, and economic freedom for a thriving industry, which is not just here in the state of Maryland, but can be the same in Prince George's county. So in addition to my client, you'll have nine other dispensary operators who will be looking for retail sites to site their dispensary. Eight of those are black owned, so that is really important to know. And the other has two or more races.

Chair Fisher myself, the sponsor provided statistical data concerning African Americans, specifically in Prince George's county. These figures included african american population in the county, the average income comparison to white residents of Prince George county, and the county's historical connections to slavery and specific plantations that are actually still present and used as park space in Prince George's county. Recognizing the historical backdrop of slavery in Prince George's county is crucial as it helps us understand the foundation on which we stand. Advocating to establish the Maryland Reparations Commission by the General assembly reflects a dedication to justice and historic guidance. The council calls upon the General assembly to stand with states like New York, California, and others that have already started their own commissions on behalf of the county executive. Secinda Skinner, the county council liaison, expressed support from the county executive for CR 520 24. Public testimony was heard from delegate Athea McCaskill from Baltimore County District 44.

Delegate McCaskill indicated that she looks forward to working with stakeholders and modifying the bill. She is the main point person for the Black caucus on reparations for the upcoming 2025 session, and she hopes that General assembly will be encouraged by the council's support. Additionally, Reverend Kobe Little, the president of the NAACP for the state of Maryland, spoke in support of CR 520 24. Reverend Little emphasized that reparations are healing and repairing his historic injustices to African Americans and advocating for unity and action to address these issues. Linda Thornton Thomas, our own president of the NAACP for Prince George's county branch, stated the NAACP aims to extend its efforts beyond the county's borders and ensure widespread adoption. It aims to explore avenues of providing reparations, whether it's in housing opportunities, education, or business ownership. Josephine Mourning, a president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference for Prince George's county and obviously it was founded by Doctor Martin Luther King spoke in support of CR 520 24 on behalf of C of C of CLC, indicating it's been long overdue for descendants of African Americans who are severely impacted by chattel slavery. NAACP NCLC support for reparations Commission is rooted in recognizing injustice and the need for economic empowerment and business opportunities of African Americans. Nicole Bruno, a Prince George county resident for twelve years, also spoke in favor of establishing a commission. Miss Bruno of caucasian nationality acknowledged the potential opposition.

Now, therefore, Angela Osterbrooks, county Executive and county chair Jolene Ivey, and the county council for Prince George's County, Maryland do hereby proclaim April 2024 as check and chance month in honor of the efforts to increase awareness of obstacles in place that hinder those with criminal records from becoming productive members of our community. Further, we urge all residents to recognize the importance of second chance month and to support efforts that promote successful reentry and rehabilitation for individuals rejoining the community. I will present this to Eddie Mathis, and he and, and director Mike Williams. You may have an opportunity after the chair to say a word or two. Two minutes, chair? Sure. I'm going to cede the mic to them, actually. And I think that councilmember Hawkins has certainly been a great advocate for this issue and has said all that the council needs to say on this matter today. First, let me just thank the council for recognizing April a second chance month. This is a significant accomplishment. RCAD was established in 2022. In the two years that we've been operating, we've been able to implement programs to assist our men and women who are returning from periods of incarceration, from state, federal, and local facilities. The county has hired ten returning citizens in county agencies, ranging from the Department of Public Works and Transportation to the health department. And so we look to increase that number as we move forward.

We've also launched our employee reimbursement initiative, by which county employers, private sector employers, can receive a reimbursement of up to $5,000 for hiring our men and women who are coming home. So far, we've only been able to recruit one business, but we are working hard to increase that number as well. And so I think this is going to be a great step in moving that forward. And so, once again, I'd like to thank the council and county executive also Brooks, for this recognition. Thank you. My name is Eddie Mathis, and I am a liaison, reentry liaison from the office of Councilman Hawkins. What I kind of do is, and I'm not going to take a lot of time, but what I kind of do, you know, I like to use a sports analogy in terms of an agent that goes out and find players. Well, that's what I do with groups, reentry groups, and I kind of, like, put them all together. We just got finished putting together a, a black umbrella coalition where there's maybe 30 organizations in them, and each spoke represent an organization. We've been doing a lot of things quietly. We're really ready to break out now. I want to thank Councilman Hawkins for allowing me to function this capacity, and I am a returning citizen. I hate to say it many times over, but this is it. Thank you. Open up your op ed, Jesus. County council. We got Anita Jordan. In the next, we have CR 28 2024 a resolution concerning black maternal health week for the purpose of recognizing April 11 through the 17th as the annual Black Maternal Health Week to bring countywide attention to maternal health crises in the United States and the importance of reducing maternal mortality and morbidity among black women and birthing persons.

So I just look forward to the partnership of the council on this. Miss Watson. Motion carries 90. The next thing on our agenda will be the board of health.

The Board of Appeal hearings are being called to order at 06:00 p.m. on Wednesday, May 8, 2024, per the discussed decision announced by the county executive, effective March 9, 2022, at 05:00 p.m. the Prince George's county state of emergency expired in an abundance of caution, and given the current state of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic, the county council is now operating under the following procedures. The Board of Appeals in person meetings and or hearings continue to operate virtually using alternative public participation options, including utilization of digital technology or teleconferencing. Virtual hearings are recorded and transcribed during the meeting. Please state your name for the record each time you speak for clarity in transcription. Please do not speak over another person. If you wish to speak, please raise your hand to be called upon. I will call upon you in turn. Please listen carefully to our criteria. Our criteria for granting appeals involving variances pursuant to Council Bill CB 16 2021, section 27 230 of the Zoning Ordinance authorizes the board to grant variances when a specific parcel of land is physically unique and unusual in a manner different from the nature of surrounding properties with respect to exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape, exceptional topographic conditions, or other extraordinary conditions peculiar to the specific parcel, such as historical significance or environmentally sensitive features. The particular uniqueness and peculiarity of this specific property causes a zoning provision to impact disproportionate proportionately upon that property, such that strict application of the provision will result in peculiar and unusual practical difficulties to the owner of the property. Such variance is the minimum reasonably necessary to overcome the exceptional physical conditions. Such variances can be granted without substantial impairment to the intent, purpose, and integrity of the general plan or any area, master plan, sector plan, or transit district development plan affecting the subject property, and such variance will not substantially impair the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a variance may not be granted if the practical difficulty is self inflicted by the owner of the property. All of these criteria must apply. If the board determines that it needs to seek technical assistance from any other governmental agency, we shall do so. The approval of a variance is not a guarantee that further review will not be necessary by any other governmental authorities. Following the approval of a variance, a building permit must be obtained. Before any building permits will be processed by the county permits office, a copy of the board's written order must be presented. Approval of any variance is contingent upon development of the property in compliance with the board's approved site and elevation plans. If the board determines that it needs to seek technical assistance from any other governmental agency, we shall do so. The approval of a variance is not a guarantee that further review will not be necessary by any other governmental authorities. Following the approval of a variance, a building permit must be obtained before any building permits will be processed by the county permits office, a copy of the board's written order must be presented. Approval of any variance is contingent upon development of the property in compliance with the board's approved site and elevation plans. All board of appeal hearings are virtual. However, if necessary, a portion of the meeting may be conducted in closed session. Our new variant for this evening, our first one is v 25 24. Juan Flores, spanish language interpreter, requested and we do have Mister Soto Gomez. This was a request for variants of 18ft lot width at the building line, 6ft lot width at the front street line, 2.2ft side yard width and a waiver of the parking area location requirement to validate existing conditions.

Ms. Olga, could you put a v. Exhibit number two element of the program. Can you see? Yes, I can be. So you are going to construct this in front of the house? Yes, and I can explain the reason why. Please do. Okay. The ocho piece. Sei pulgadas. Talico. Molotienen, baria. Casa de mi vesindario. So I wanted to build a truck with 8ft and six inches, just as other houses have it in my neighborhood. So when I proposed this to the county, the engineer that revised it, he said that I had to have a limit of to the neighbor's property of three and a half feet. I just wanted to clarify one thing I heard you say. You said you were building it 8ft, six inches. Yes. That's the standard measure of all the driveways in my neighborhood. 8.6. According to the diagram we have. You're saying it's a 20 by 24? That's what was approved by the engineer that revised it at the county. What is the kitchen? De la casa de la driveway. Because then I would have to have it. I wouldn't be able to have it three and a half feet from the neighborhood. So the way that all the other driveways are in the neighborhood. So would it have been possible to put it on the left side? No. De la casa Nueva. Pie exactos. No, because it's exactly the same measure. You'll see that it's 9ft on both sides and you will see it there on the survey that I had done, that the house with the person that did the survey, the house sits exactly in the middle. Miss Stone. Yes. They increased the size from what he was asking for. Do you have any more? I'm sorry, Mister Sotagom. Okay. More than likely, because the standards now a driveway must be at least, I believe, ten to 12ft. It cannot be any smaller than that.

Plus the fact that the code requires when you're putting in a new driveway and apron, you have to have a setback of three and a half feet. I guess my question is why didn't they keep it at the 10ft versus 20? That I do not know. Other than the petitioner requesting a double wide driveway. This is Boymore. Miss snow. If he only wanted a single car driveway, would he need a variance? There's another woman talking. Who is that? Sorry. It was me. I'm sorry. Oh, okay. Even if it were a ten foot wide driveway, I believe he would still be within the front of the house because his setback is 9ft. So that would say, you know, even if he had a ten foot wide, he would still need the variance for the driveway in front of the house. In front of the house. Can I say something? Yes. Okay. Lo besinos extendido the del sidewalk, the del saiwok asta el final de la casa. Yo keria cervaci, pero. Okay. Okay. Gracias. Well, actually, my neighbors on 20 413 and 20 417, which are my neighbors on both sides of my house, they both have their driveways that measure 8ft, six inches and they go eight six wide and they go from the sidewalk all the way to the end of the house. That's what I tried to do, but I couldn't do it because of the separation. More than likely those your neighbors driveways were done prior to the code stating that you need the three and a half feet setback and the code that requires your driveway be 10ft. Miss Olga, could you slide the photograph up a little bit to see if there's anything under that red stamp? You can go back to the site plan, if you would. There it is. The county has approved a 20 by 24 driveway and apron. Gracias. Thank you. Now, if he wanted to reduce it to a ten by whatever, he certainly has that right. But he needs to go back to site roads to get a reapproval plan. Does he wish to keep it at the 20ft wide, a double driveway? I would like to keep it like that because I wouldn't want to start this process again. Okay, thank you. Okay. Gracious. This is board member Iceland. Miss Stone. If he reduced the size of the driveway to any capacity, he would still need a variance for a waiver of the parking requirement in front of home. Is that correct? That is correct. And this is board McBrice. Again, Mister Contreras, is there street parking available on the street? No, no. Principal Motivo, Jonas driveway? No, that's the main reason why I need to build my driveway. Sorry, this is Borkman Rice for me. Can people park on the street? Todo mundo norepetta, le Paso calipertine. La caye publica todo mundo. Yes, it's. It's free parking for the same reason nobody, nobody respects anybody else's property. And so they say because it's free that everybody parks there and they even put, put up cones. Is there, is there permit parking? Is there a permit required to park on the street? No. No. Thank you. Okay. Do you, mister Contreras, do you realize that anybody actually, because it's a public street, anybody can park anywhere on the street, but they cannot put up tones. Pero locino, Puerto Rico. See, your joint, joint problem. Yes, I understand that, but the issue is that in the houses, there's a lot of people with a lot of cars, and I can't find parking for ours. How long have you lived in the property? Since June of last year. This is Boyle Bryson again. How many cars are you trying to. How many cars do you have that need parking? I have four vehicles, two for work, one for my daughter, and one for my wife. This attorney Garner. I just want to remind the board members to remember what the requirements are for granting the variance. Okay. Now, you do know if you get a double driveway, you're taking away parking on the street? Yes. Is your lot different from any other lots on the neighborhood? No, but I know not. Not all the lots are exact. They don't have the exact same dimension. Are there any other double driveways on your block in su quadra Ayalmas? Yes, they have. I've seen a couple that have double driveway, and I've also seen some that have the extended driveway that I told you as of before that I mentioned previously on the side of the house. Correct.

Could you look at the application for 25 24? Yeah, in the binder. The address is 7900 and 920 5th Avenue. I think it was just incorrect in the agenda.

I believe that it was rescheduled from April. Hold on 1 second. Yes, we have heard it several times. As a matter of fact, we've heard it 12345 times. So what's. What's going on with it? Okay, Miss Olga, can you explain? I don't have it in front of me at the moment. Looks like the first time we heard it was January 24. It was. Oh yes. This was the fence that he put up between the play area and the driveway. And Inspector Swan said it was not adequate. Then we heard it on February 7. It was still not adequate. And Mister Swan was going to give us a report then. Looks like March 8. I'm sorry, hold on 1 second. If I recall this one. Because when I was looking at the elevations, the driveway goes all the way across. When I think the applicant was convincing us that that was a kid's play area. Yes. And we were waiting for. He put a fence up and, um. Inspector Swan said the fence was not permanent. So Mister Swan was going to give us a report. Miss Olga, did we hear anything from Mister Swan? Yes, it's not there. I see we're seeing a blank screen. Blanket. Okay, hold on. Let me stop. Mister Swan's report is at exhibit 30. Okay. Pictures in a letter stating that the fence was not permanent.

And he said no, actually, even though there were cars parked there, he said that it will be a play area for his children. And we required him put a border up. So you cannot drive on that area. He put up a fence and the inspector said it was not a permanent fence. And then we needed a report from Mister Swan to find out if it was permanent. And that's what I'm trying to get to. Let's see.

The report from Mister Swan was that including that construction of a building, it wasn't on the last one, was it? It was a request for variance, fibble in height in order to validate existing conditions. That lot area, lot with building line frontage with at the front street line, side yard parking area location, and a security exemption for a fence over 4ft in height for proposed one story addition. So there were several things going on. Including there was a five foot fence along the sidewalk. So that's what the security exemption was needed for. For. Miss Olga, are you have, are you looking for. I'm looking the pictures. Okay. I have the fan. I think everything was set. The driveway. Okay, all we're looking at is. All we're seeing is your files. We need to see the report from Mister Swan. This one. Okay, hold on please. Madam chair, would. Would you like to go ahead and swear the. Yes. Petitioner while we're waiting? Mister Kebram? Yes. Could we get your name and address for the record? Yes. Full name Marhawi Kebram. And the address? 2005 Virginia Avenue High School, Maryland. Zip code 20785. Is anyone with you tonight? No. Mister Swan, you're here for this case. Prince George's County Inspector Swan, 9200 basal court in Largo, Maryland. Could I get you all to raise your right hand so that we could swear your testimony in please? Do you soundly swear or affirm under the penalties of perjury that the responses given and statements made will be the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I do, Mister Cabom. Yes, you do? Yeah, I do. Yes. Thank you. Okay, so we're waiting on the. Miss Olga, have you found the report yet? Yes, hold on. I think I do. Give me just 1 second please, because this is a large binder. Yes, I have one here. Trying too much? Yes sir. First, Georgia county inspector swarm something here. Okay. I think my understanding is Mister Karam is kind of in a catch 22 in that he needs a security exemption for defense. However, because of the violation and the fact that he needs a permit, he can't get the permit without the exemption. And not, my understanding is with the violation, it kind of puts him on hold with his variance. We tried to give him some direction, but ultimately I think the only, in my opinion, is only pathway. I forgot to bring up the oranges. Can you mute your mic for a minute while Mister Swan is speaking? Thank you. It is only path forward, in my opinion, would be to remove all the violations and then resubmit that. That's the only. That's the only way I can see where he could get the variance that he's requesting for the addition because he's. He's trying to lump everything together and I don't know how he does that, but I could be wrong. Have you discussed this with Mister Cabon? I don't know that I put it in those terms as plainly as that. I've had communication with him, my direct supervisors had communication with him and he pretty much confirmed what I had said, but I'm not sure if it was understood or interpreted correctly. Mister Swan, could you explain what violations he would have to take care of the fence that's in front of the house. He would need a permit for that because it's over 4ft in height at the front of the house and the excess concrete both in the front and the back, which are a violation. And so what you're saying is he should file for the variance for the fence and the concrete and drop the addition? No, actually it was. My perspective is the other way around. I'm sorry, you should go. He should go forward. Try and go forward with the additional. However, the way I understand it, in order for, and correct me if I'm wrong, in order for you all to consider the variance for the addition, he would have to have essentially clean hands and he can't achieve that as long as those violations are there. Because one of which would require a variance to have it and cure the violation. He would have to have a variance to be able to get a permit to cure the violation. But I don't know that. Unfortunately we can't approve the addition because of the height of the fence and the extended concrete. Well I believe that's what he's saying. He'd have to do away with those. In order to get the variance for the building that he wants to put there. He would have to remove those things? Yes. I was a little concerned when I saw the elevations. When I saw the driveway went all the way across when he told us it was a play area. So that would have to be something. The applicant would have to determine what he wants to do there. Chair. Madam, may I speak now or. Absolutely. Okay. So since in the last I have been told to be to put the railing to separate the patio from the existing driveway. So I have done that. So post Inspector Swan was mentioning in his report, it was not unadducated. So I was asking him for his suggestion to make. To be the work adequate. So per his suggestion, he told me to check with the department of proper meeting. Then I. I submit my application for permit application for the funds and for the patio altogether.

So per his suggestion, he told me to check with the department of proper meeting. Then I. I submit my application for permit application for the funds and for the patio altogether. So the department of permitting, they just told me it is on hold because of the note of the railing. Of the railing. It is only due to the fence since it is 5ft. So they told me to get a security exemption from the borough of appeal. So they have given me a referral to you. Other than that, there is no an issue with the adequacy of the small railing with the department of permitting. I already submit my drawing and my application with the Department of permitting and inspection. Well, that's why I'm hoping that Miss Olga can pull it up because I was just a little concerned when I saw your drawings. Mister Swan, has he satisfied a adequate fence separating the driveway from the patio area? Not that I'm aware of. And Prince George County Inspector Swan? Not that I'm aware of. And what Mister Brown is requesting is that I come up with a solution for him to address that part of the violation. And what he does not realize is that my hands are tied. I'm not allowed to do that. I can only tell him if what he choses, what he chooses is adequate or not. I'm not allowed to tell him what he can do. That is why he was directed back to the permitting department. Because they can. I'm not allowed to. Right. Yeah. But you have told him that it's inadequate, that it's not permanent. Yes. So in other words, he knows that that railing must be permanent. Correct. In the concrete. Correct. So. And he hasn't done that yet? Not that I'm aware of. Yeah. Dear chair madam. Yeah, so since I have been told to check with the department of permitting. So I already submit the drawing for. For all of the railing, the patio and the fence. So they haven't raised any question on that? The only thing that they are holding me, my permitting to get for the funds and for the party is the only thing the fence is, since it is more than 5ft. So they are asking me to get on a security exemption from the board of appeal and they refer, they have a referral from them. So I mean, I am not what to do in here. Okay. I've been following all the instructions. I have been told. Okay, so you've been told that the railing between the driveway and the patio must be permanent and that you applied for your permit but you need a security exemption for the five foot fence. That's right. So why haven't you made that fence, that railing permanent and possibly cut that five foot fence down to 4ft? Yeah. The reason, I mean for the small railing. Because I have been told to put a railing. So in my side. In my. In my side. I did it for a permanent since the inspector told me it is not uh. Unaddocate but I don't know how to make it unaddocate because I pay for that. I pay for that some money and I have. If I do something in case, if it's again, if it's rejected. So I need some directions in here chair. Madam. One of my concerns is when I look at your diagrams you have depicted as all driveway. And if we take those plans and let you get a permit on it, it's considered driveway. When you said it's a play lot. Yeah. I say to the patio plans that way. The ones I saw. Yes. That on the photographs there was actually cars parked there. Yeah. That's why. So I have been told by the border appeal to put some railing in order to prevent from further uh. Parking use. So I have. That's why I put that railing to prevent or to. For parking. Right. And it wasn't permanent. So I think Mister Swan is trying to explain that if you want to follow through on your addition, you have to cure all the other violations first. Yeah, I understand Shermadam on that. That's why I am. I was sorry. Submitting my application for permit application for the fence and for the patio. But the permit is on hold because due to the height of the funds and that's why it is on hold the parent to get my permit to satisfy the violation. But I miss Olga. Can we see photographs or site plans? Mister Kebrom, I don't understand why you don't just cut that fence, that five foot fence down to 4ft. Okay. To get rid of the security exemption requirement. And then we can look at the railing. Okay. Okay. The only reason that I put the furnaces, I mean for privacy for my kids because their bedroom window is facing to the street and there was some inappropriate things that was happening. So that's why I don't want to expose my kids. That's why I put the 5ft fence in front of the house since the. The kid's bedroom is facing to the street and there was a lot of activity that doesn't want the kids to be exposed. So that's why I. That is the reason behind the fence. Okay. The fence is what's causing all of your problems in my opinion. Yeah. So it would be good if we could see. Yeah. Miss Olga, we're still looking at your files. Okay. Which one you want to see? We want to see the site plan? This is the site plan. But I. No, no. He just sent me a revised site plan also. No, no, no. We're looking at your file. We're looking at files.

Some houses have like more than 6ft fence in their front of their house. Several houses. I can tell. I mean, I am aware of that. I'm validating. But I was trying to correct. To get the permit. I pay my fence, I pay my violation ticket, and I pay 2000 for the drawing for the patio. We can't, unfortunately, we can't incorporate any finances you may have put out. Yeah, I mean, just. I'm trying to. I did my. See, right. On this photo here. On this photo there. There was a car park where you say it's a. A kid's lot. Yes. The bicycle plan. Okay. Now the one below that, that's. I think that's the one I saw. Okay. This is the Ravaisai plan. And it still says driveway. Mm hmm. And it's another piece that says that as well. So if we approve this, we're approving a driveway. Right. I think this is the crocus. Hold on. Yeah, this is what. This is another one I'm speaking of. You see how the driveway goes all the way across? Right. I mean, chairman, this is the naming issue that we put. I mean, sinus. Well, that should not say driveway at all. If you're saying it's a play area. Yes. Say play area or patio. Yeah. It says we party. Yeah. This is with a renaming issue, so. But your. Your revised plans don't demonstrate that it's a play area. It demonstrates that it's a driveway. Maybe I see the mistake. Yeah. And so you're also trying to get an addition built in the back. Yeah. That is the main core application that I came to the board of appeal. Since I am a family of six member, we are living in less than nine square foot. That is my primary application. Then we have gone through these difficult things that I did unaware of before core application was for the addition of the story. Well, the whole conversation was about you curing one thing so that you could get another. Yeah, as I mentioned, I didn't think of this thing since I was not aware it requires a permit. Then I. I just don't see how you're curing anything with these revised plans. We're still in the exact same position. You have not cured anything. Yeah, I already put the railings since I have been told to separate the. But that was not permanent. I. That's why the. I mean, I did it for permanent and I'm not going. I mean, I put my word that is not going to be used going forward for. It was one occasion that the parking. It was easier since there was a family visitation. Other than that, this is not the intention of the. If you say. If you. I mean, if he told me I'm going to. I can remove the patio if it is difficult to proceed. So you're saying you would. Yeah, I can remove it because we need to know what the patio was because everything here says driveway. Yeah, but it's a naming issue, chair madam. Yes, otherwise. But you cannot just change the name of it because you still need the barrier between the padding. He said it will remove it. Remove. No. Yeah, I mean, if there is no an option. Because it is complicating the whole purpose of this my. For the addition of the story. And it is going to different directions. Okay, well, if you'd like to submit new site plans, you're more than welcome to to do so for us to review. But still. Yeah, I don't know. Then the revised site plan must show that as grass area. So you're going to submit a revised plan, removing that patio area and show it as grass area, and then maybe we can move forward with the security exemption. Okay. Which will also. He doesn't need lot coverage. Does he know? Yes, absolutely. That will reduce your lot coverage. Well, you could think about it, mister Kebarm. And who's working his case? Olga. Yes, Olga. You could contact Olga and work with her on redoing your site plan. So, chair madam. So you are asking me to redo the site plan and remove the patio, right? Yes. Okay. This is Swan. The patio was the original cause of the violation. Right in the fence in the face. Thank you. So the lot coverage would be reduced and we would still need. Miss Olga, can you go back to the site plan, please? Because I'm thinking the parking area location requirement would be wiped out and we would just need the square foot net lot area, lot width, front street line, reduce the lot coverage. He'd still need a two foot left side, yard width, 3ft. Right, sorry, side width and possibly reduce. No, the driveway would still be in front of the house. That would. Okay, he will remove this area, correct? Yes. Where the patio umbrella is. Yeah. Okay, so the driveway goes straight in. So let me find out. Not this patio, is it? It's the one in the front.

That road can be moved. It's not permanent. It's not permanent. And that's what Mister Swan's issue was, that that rail is not permanent. He can easily pick it up, remove the gazebo and the tables and then park there. I know. What about the things he. He will remove the fence too, right? No, no, no. He'll still need a security exemption for the five foot fence in the front of the house. This part? Yes. Okay. Do you still need to see the revised side plan? Not really, because it doesn't really change anything. Just all that concrete where that patio area is, has got to go. Okay. And the site plan would, would it would be replaced with grass. Replaced with. Okay, all the rocks. Well, I don't know if the. The rocks on the board, brick pavers have to go, but all that concrete must go. Okay. So let's see what he can work out with us. Okay? Yes, ma'am. Did you have any other questions, Mister Kebam? So once I remember this patio, then hopefully I will get the variants for the exemption for the panels. Because I already have a referral for the security exemption for the funds from the department of permitting. Okay, Mister Swan, once that railing and all that concrete is gone, he would not need the permit for the railing, is that correct? I'm kidding. He would not know. He's not going to need the. The permit for the railing. However, the census in front of the yard. Yard violation is still a violation. And to cure that part of the violation as well, in order to move forward, right? So he would need the security exemption. So the fence in the front, does that have a permit? No. Okay. Yeah, that's why. Yeah, I'm telling you, I already submit my permit application, but it is on hold because of the hate of the fund. So they gave me a referral to the board of Appeal to get a security exemption. I have already submitted to Mister Olega. The referral for the security exemption. Okay, so he would need to submit a copy of the revised plan showing the demolition of the concrete and the railing in front of the house to the permit. Right? Okay. Or reduce that fence to 4ft. Right? Right. Correct. If you have any further questions, Mister Cabron, you'd always call our office and we'll work with you. Okay? So you are mentioning still I'm not going to get a security exemption for the plans from the board of appeal. It would be much easier if you took it down to 4ft. I mean, yeah, if I took it. So I don't. So why I need to come to the board of appeals and when. I mean why, why I need to come back again? Because if I removed the patio and the furnace, so. Well, you still want to build that addition in the rear. Yeah, but yeah, so, yeah, because I came to the. For the addition story because this patio. So it was exceeding the load coverage because of this patio. But if the patio is removed, then I have enough. You still need variances because you need side yard setbacks. You need net lot areas, variants, lot width at the building line, 2ft side lot width at the front street line, lot coverage which will be reduced, but I seriously doubt it's going to wipe it out. 2ft left side yard width. 3ft, right side, yard width. Now, once you get rid of that concrete and the fence, the security exemption would go away. But because of the drive, the existing driveway is still in front of the house. You still need a parking lot with. Right. A waiver of parking lot location for the. For that left side. Right. So you would be decreasing the need for some variances, but you still need variances in order to get the addition. Okay. The addition, I believe, does not need any variances. I thought that was locked coverage. It's part of lock coverage, yes, if I can interject. Yes. Mister Swan. Prince George county inspector Swan, Mister Gibron. Reach out to me in the morning and I'll tell me again, please give me a call in the morning. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your help, Mister Swan. Yes, thank you.

Could I get you all to please raise your right hand so that we could swear your testimony in. Do you soundly swear or affirm under the penalties of perjury that the responses given and statements made will be the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Yes. Yes. Okay, Mister Warner, are you going to start? Yes, ma'am. I'm not sure if you remembered the case or not, but we. Oh, yes. We went in front of you for appearances, for property lines, and extending this carport. Out beyond the face of the house and such. And then we had to go to the city, and we negotiated with the city and the neighbors to try to accommodate a reasonable agreement on relocating the garage, taking it down from what it was. I've lived here for 30 years. In this particular house. I've had carports for my antique car collection. I have two of them. I've had them for 25 years. I've had carports, and Google maps would certainly show you that raised three kids in this house. And all I'm trying to do is build a structure that doesn't need maintenance, like the carports that I had had vinyl, and it was steel, concrete buckets holding them down, but it was canvas, so the canvas would wear out about once a year. I'd have to go out there and put new tarps on it and all that, so kind of looked kind of raggedy. So I decided to put up a carport, talk to the city inspector, and I know he's no longer with us in the city. He retired, I believe, and I asked him. He showed up one day when I was just in the driveway, wasn't building anything down yet, and we were talking about cars, and he, like, looked at my cars and what have you. I mentioned to him that I'd like to build a metal carport similar to the size that I have, which it's actually smaller than the four that I had before, by about 80 ground coverage. And he said, yes. I don't see a problem with that, because you've had him here for 25 years. If somebody complains, then we got to. We got to get you to get a permit for your. For your shelter. So with that being said, you know, there's no proof. Unfortunately, he's retired. I tried to call him personally. I confronted the city about that conversation, and there's really no proof other than my word that that's what was said. I certainly would have never taken down the carports that I had here because they were grandfathered in. Nobody ever said anything to me for 25 years about my shelters. And now, you know, I want to follow the rules, and I'm compliant with everything so far. I've been totally compliant and negotiable with my things that I am willing to do to make this happen. All I'm trying to do is protect my cars and my cars under a shelter. A carport, not a closed garage, an open carport. And that's where I'm at. Who is this person you say that's retired? Oh, gosh miss elma would have to tell you his name. I don't remember him exactly, but it was one of the older gentlemen that was a city inspector. And shortly after, he told me that I needed. He showed up another day when we were building the structure, and he said, hey, I got to ask you to stop. I'm not giving you a stop work notice. I'm not violating you, but I have to ask you to stop and go get permits for this thing. I didn't realize it was going to be this big, blah, blah, blah. So I immediately stopped and did everything he asked me to do. Shortly after that, he either retired, got fired, not sure.

Mister Werner, did you get a revised plan approved from Hyattsville, or did they just say, okay, you're good, I'll be. Revised plan? Yes. William Lachance. It's a revised plan. It wasn't approved, but I guess Rainer approved it last night. Do you have a copy of that? Yes, ma'am. And you should have copies of that we sent. That was. That's the copy right there. That's it? Yep. This is the new location that we agreed with the neighbors that they would be happy with these changes to deconstruct the building and put it against my house, parallel with the house and in line with the front of the house so that it's not interfering with their property or shedding water onto their runoff onto their properties. Okay. Is your lot different in size from other lots in the community? Oh, yeah. It's a chopped up. I got all the leftovers, madam chair. I got all. Yes, I'm sorry. For the record, I did speak with Jamie Stepowani at park and planning, for your information. Of course, the front line is Rainier Avenue. At the north part of the site plan, there is a 40.52 foot property line that is considered a side yard. Now, if you go towards the east, excuse me, the west part of the property, along the. Whoops. The property that is looks like 65 93. From the top of that iron pipe to where it says nail set, that is considered the rear property line. Now, to the right of that nail set, where it says 23 90, the portion that says looks like 1640. And the 4710, that. And then also where it says 4126, that is considered the side, the right side yard. Does that change anything that we have? No, but I just wanted to clarify where the actual front, rear and two sides, just for your information. Thank you. Okay, now we have. Miss Abe, did you have something you wanted to add to the record, Miss Abe? Yes, ma'am. I live at 4217 and I was involved in the review meetings, design meetings with the town of Mount Rainier. We went back and forth on what was a potential solution for this problem. Mister Werner, actually, he installed this over a weekend. Somebody called, it wasn't me. And complained about it. So that's kind of the backstory. I'm going to cut to the chase of where my concerns are. During the meeting where we finally came to a way to reconcile our differences is that he would be, at a minimum 2ft from my property line. Where you see that particular marker where it says 2ft. That's a minimum. I believe he could get closer to his house to make it less obtrusive to both myself and to Mister Gowdy, who lives below. My greatest concern with this is it's a variance. And my concern is that be it Mister Werner or the somebody else who buys that house could actually use this as a reason to take this carport and then turn it into a permanent structure. And that is one of my greatest concerns. Because if you look at the size of that carport and its footprint, it's almost the size of his house. So I'm having some. You know, we agreed to him reorienting it. So it is more in keeping with the street I have flagged. And I will continue to flag that. I have great deal concern in the orientation of the access into his carport from Rainier Avenue. Traffic is coming down the street and it's uphill. And I believe that when the cars will pull out, I do believe that there will be pedestrian potential hazards that are there. However, the city of Mount Rainier owns the right of way and they seem to be okay with this. But I am flagging as a person who actually understands these sorts of design issues. I have a great deal of concern about the aprons and the fact that there's a sidewalk there and it's coming downhill. There's some line of sight issues in my opinion. But my greatest concern is that this structure, because it is a structure today that has been allowed that it could one day become a large permanent structure which would then impact the visual view of my house. And then also mister Gooty below who is suffering from some, with a lot of runoff. So that's where I stand with that. One of the things that we were told by the review board is that he's allowed to put the size of the structure here. And so that's why I conceded to it. I still feel that a structure that's almost as big as the house is not in keeping with the character as intended of Mount Rainier. But that's basically what I have to say. And I'm just going to say this just as a general rule.

And I think we're in for a, a tough summer as far as that's concerned. So that's all I have to say. For the record. If there is a way, if you grant him this variance, that you can put a clause in there that this same structure cannot be turned into a permanent footprint. That would be what I would ask Charles, and I believe Charles Gudy. He registered through my email to be a speaker because he didn't, hasn't had access to email. So is it okay if he says he's more than welcome? Just put your name on the record, mister Goody. For the record, my name is Charles Goodey. And I'm in full agreement with Miss Abe. And you know, our biggest concern also is aesthetics, the historic, what would you call it, element of the, the town. And keeping with that and not having airplane hangars in the neighborhood, the runoff, which would be catastrophic. I mean, we've stated everything before and it's all on record, but we still maintain our positions and we're not, you know, backing down. I think, ma'am, we're just here just to make sure that at a minimum what was agreed to gets done and that's why we're here. But the consideration of the permanent structure I think is the greatest concern. So you all did work with them in relocating the carport closer to his house? Yes, because the way the grade works, it would work to swing around and it actually allows him more space to the side. So, you know, I think that that remedied it. But proportionately speaking, you can see by the footprint, it's fairly large. In fairness to Mister Werner, he did hire. He did. He's agreed to lower, per the drawings, the height of the structure, which was a major sticking point. It was almost 15ft tall. It was very large. But again, I greatest consideration, because I know that once a footprint is in place, it becomes a very easy thing to turn it into something else. And so I just want to make sure that all of a sudden that doesn't become a way for one day down the road, a huge structure that's, you know, two stories tall to be located there. One thing for sure, if it's enclosed, they have to get a permit for that. But it was reduced. The height was reduced to what? To. I think it. I. Per the drawings, I think it's 12ft to the collar. He has the drawings. But where. My concern, ma'am, is that that footprint of that carport could become a reason for someone down the line to say, okay, I'm going to build a big old structure there. That's too, you know, two, three stories tall. And it changes the whole composition. You're given a variance for the location of a structure. And so we haven't done it yet. But your city has agreed to it. Did you these concerns with them? No, because it was a very contentious meeting. But you know, I. I don't think they think about that. And I am thinking about it because I do see how, how things evolve very quickly with footprints. Once a footprint's there, it's there. So I would ask that I understand Mister Warner wants to protect his cars. I've looked at those. I've lived in Mount Rainier for 17 years. I was here. I bought the house in 2007 and went through the drop of property values. And so I know what tents he's talking about that he housed his vehicles in. So I don't want to hurt his ability to use his property. I do believe that we should be protecting against runoff and overall architectural integrity. And the fact that a two or three story, if that footprint is allowed without restriction, it could turn into a two to three foot, two to three foot two to three story addition at some point that will really have a lot of impact on the street. So that's, that's my, that's, that's why I'm here tonight, is to cite those concerns to the board. And I thank you for listening to me. Thank you for your input. I do have a question, Mister Werner. Are you intending on putting another driveway to that structure? Only if asked to. Two strips, two concrete pads to get to the garage, I guess, or to the carport. Also, let me clarify that the height of the building will be lowered from twelve foot to the inside collar, which means the interior roof beams down to 9ft exactly from the footings, from what they are bolted to. Anchored to. So I'm taking all 3ft in height and moving it parallel with my house and in line with the front of the property. So it's not a two story structure. Never intended to enclose it, but like she said, possibility of somebody else wanting to do that. It's always there. But it's a carport. It's not a structure that can be added to or raised or anything like that. It's a steel roofed carport. So, Miss Eight, just to kind of appease your worry, if this variance were granted, it would be specifically worded as an open carport. When it comes to the building permit, it is an open carport and they would word the a", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Mister Werner", "insights": [{"observation": "He has agreed to lower, per the drawings, the height of the structure, which was a major sticking point.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "I do believe that we should be protecting against runoff.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "It's a steel roofed carport.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "I don't want to hurt his ability to use his property.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "I have a lot of concern about, and just in listening to previous cases about all the concrete and impervious areas that are going on, lots.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Mount Rainier Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Our climate is changing and we all have to be very mindful of where the water from impervious surfaces are going to run because it is changing.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "I do believe that we should be protecting against runoff and overall architectural integrity.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The review board has allowed the size of the structure.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "A clause could be put in that this same structure cannot be turned into a permanent footprint.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Mister Werner", "insights": [{"observation": "He has agreed to lower, per the drawings, the height of the structure, which was a major sticking point.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "I do believe that we should be protecting against runoff.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "It's a steel roofed carport.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "I don't want to hurt his ability to use his property.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "I have a lot of concern about, and just in listening to previous cases about all the concrete and impervious areas that are going on, lots.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Mount Rainier Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Our climate is changing and we all have to be very mindful of where the water from impervious surfaces are going to run because it is changing.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "I do believe that we should be protecting against runoff and overall architectural integrity.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The review board has allowed the size of the structure.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "A clause could be put in that this same structure cannot be turned into a permanent footprint.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 5470812, "chunk_end_time": 5940982, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3554?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3554?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=5470"}, {"start": 54000, "end": 60000, "text": ".

So, Miss Eight, just to kind of appease your worry, if this variance were granted, it would be specifically worded as an open carport. When it comes to the building permit, it is an open carport and they would word the approval as such. If by any chance, you know, let's say Mister Warner sells his property and someone tries to build something there, that's when you would call the inspector. Inspector would come out and stop them. But always if you see anything that was not approved by, you know what, you're the meeting with Hyattsville, you can always contact the inspector. So I guess where it's the impervious footprint that concerns me from a development standpoint, because now it's locked as impervious. And so then it could become an actual structure very easily down the line. And that. That's my concern. A carport is one thing and somebody, you know, doubling the size of their house and putting a very large structure up, it could be potentially, you know, two. Two stories. And so that's. That's. Which would have a significant visual impact on both myself and other neighbors around there. And so I. That's my concern. I'm voicing it. I don't know if there's a way to. I understand what you're saying, it's going to be worded for that, but does that impervious area calculation in the lot, all of a sudden somebody looks at and says, well, I can turn that into what I want. And then it's approved and it's been done and now I'm stuck with it. That's my big concern, really. Truthfully, and that's. I don't know if there's a way around that to ensure it. Do we have the new plans that shows the difference in the height? We have any measurements on that? Yes. William Lachance. Down at the bottom where it says lot 18, the peak height is now twelve foot, 12.5ft. Previously it was. Wait a minute, this plan, oh, 12.5 is to the peak. The previous one was 13 foot to the mid peak, so 14ft high. So it's been dropped by several feet, 3ft. It's on the plan? Yes. Now this, when you say you're going to have two strips of concrete, has that been included in that, Miss Stone? Yes, ma'am. It is shown on the site plan as one point. I think it's 1.7 foot wide strips. Concrete strips. Mister Lachance, we haven't heard from you, have we? I was just speaking about the hype. Okay. All right. Anything else we need to put on the record? No, I think we pretty much covered it. Now. What is. What is the ground cover under this? Is it concrete? Gravel. Gravel. The whole. The whole area where the carport is, is gravel. About six inches of stone. Gravel. Comment, madam? The gravel is about a foot. Could you state your name before you speak? Oh, I'm sorry. This is Mary Abe, the adjoining neighbor. The gravel is about a foot in depth. Pictures which I can provide, which I think are already on record. And the concern is that because the elevation is raised, that some of the water, the sub grade is heading towards, it will head towards my land and then go down to the gouties, which are in a very unfortunate. If you think his lot is cut up, you ought to see. You ought to see their lot. It's really. They're in a low point, but that's a problem right now. The gravel is pulled back from the property line, but you can see it, it's about a foot of depth. And there's going to be a concrete footing Mister Renner is going to build, to put the structure on top of. And so there's that steel structure and then there's a concrete or a cinderbolt footing, I guess, that they'll rebuild. So I don't know if that's. If that's part of the calculations and Mister Lachance's height. And you said you could not voice any of these concerns with the. I did, ma'am, but I have a little bit of an irish temper and maybe, you know, we. I have voiced my concerns repeatedly and I think where my frustration is is that I feel like where I found out, and I didn't realize this, but there's no limitations on the number of vehicles that you can have on a lot in Prince George's county. And therefore it's okay to store them on a residential lot. And I just don't think there's a place to be storing work vehicles and a lot of vehicles in a residential lot such as this. And if you can afford to have a bunch of antique vehicles, you probably get a good storage area. And that's what I think, you know, and in fairness to mister, right, he's allowed to do this by county law. And you shouldn't be able to fill your residential lot up with cars. That's really the truth. So I guess I'm kind of at a standpoint with that. That's kind of what I've come down to. They didn't realize that there was no limitation. Any other comments or concerns by board members? Madam chair, if I could. Miss Abe, do you think it would help if he provided rain barrels? I think the volume of rain barrels, and I will speak for. Because of my knowledge, rain bears are good for water quality, not volume. And that's what everybody needs to understand with what's coming with impervious. And so the key to controlling nuisance flooding is actually reduction of impervious areas such as roofs and runoff. And so a rain barrel could be helpful. Or cistern, you know, maybe he could even reuse it or, you know, but that is my view.

It does help. Okay. I mean, a dry well is another consideration. I think at one point, the town of Mount Rainier was ready to make can do that. And then I think they. They thought that, you know, they backed off of that. But, you know, I. You know, I don't want. He's my neighbor. I don't want to be in constant war with him. And I feel like this is what it's come down to. No, I. But in the same right to. I have to protect my property values. And I am concerned about the goodies below because they are in a bad spot, they are in a low spot. And I guess that's. That's kind of where I stand. Again, the greatest consideration is that this carport will morph into something else. And so that's. That's where. Have you had water problems previously coming off of this property? Mister Goodalk, my name is Charles Gaddafi. I have permission to speak, yes, about a month or two ago, we have two sump pumps and a backup sump pump in our base basement. Ended up with 14 inches of floodwater, and it's nothing new. So that's happened before? Yes. You know, and this is board member Austin. Are you saying that that's a result of this property, not a loan flooding in your basement? I'm asking you if you're saying that's a result of his property. This is Mary Abe, his neighbor, who is up above him. I've actually maintained a 20 foot vegetative buffer of natural vegetation to reduce runoff. And I'm actually going to regrade my backyard this summer to create a flat area. Any runoff. But the runoff, unfortunately, they're in a bowl. And so that's the reality, is if you were to pull up a street view picture, you would see that it's just the lay of the land. And then that is what happens in these older communities. I mean, the properties get cut up. They get. Okay, I appreciate your answer, Miss A. This is what member Austin? But I was asking, I think his name is mister. How do you say your last name again with a g? Yes. And you said that your basement flooded recently, and I'm asking you if that is a result of something going on on Mister Werner's property. I mean, I'd have to get an engineer to prove it, but I'm not saying it's all coming from there, but it contributes. Okay. I was just trying to figure out if it was relevant for this discussion. Thank you. Any other comments for the record? Yes, ma'am. William Warner. Yes. We had already negotiated and talked about many times with the city about water runoff, about a drywall, about a rain garden, all these things. And we actually, I gave them everything. I gave them a fence, a six foot fence to control the noise and the fumes from my car. Gave them a gutters with downspouts into either a drywall, hired an engineer to come out and assess the land. He said it can't happen because of the water table was too high, I believe, five foot instead of seven foot. So we went to another landscaping company, and all of this at my expense, of course, to design a rain garden. And did we designed a rain garden at the last meeting, I was willing to do all of that at my expense. And both of my neighbors that are with us right now agreed that if I take the building down from where it is now and move it to the side of the house and put in the appropriate height, nine foot, that we were good. And it was very clear at the meeting that there was no other decisions, negotiations, or anything that was agreed to or disagreed to. And we voted. The city voted, and we had the votes. So now here we are now negotiating water runoff and what have you. When I do, if I'm able to move this building to the new location, I plan to remove the gravel and try to grow grass there. All the way around the building, if possible. Twelve inches high. No, it's not twelve inches high. My land is higher than hers. That's just the way it is. My backyard, side yard, whatever you want to call it, is higher property level, naturally, than her yard. But I know for a fact that there's six inches of gravel throughout my driveway, and has been for 25 years now. My driveway, from the backyard to the front street level, drops down by 20 inches in height so it naturally flows to the street. And the gravel that's in front of the carport is where the water from my yard goes. And I've watched it during the rains, and I've actually got videos of it during the rains, hard rainstorms of where my water goes. So I'm not sure about all the other stuff. Yes, the building will have a roof on it and it will shed water. And most likely I'm going to put downspouts and gutters on it. You say most likely or you will? Well, I mean, that's certainly an option, but it wasn't something that was agreed upon with the town or my neighbors. So at this point, I just want to get the structure relocated and lowered and get the pads of concrete in there so I can start protecting my cars. My cars are sitting out with car covers on them. And I know the value doesn't matter to you, and ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "William Warner", "insights": [{"observation": "William Warner discussed implementing a rain garden to manage water runoff and had previously installed a six-foot fence to control noise and fumes from his car.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "William Warner mentioned hiring an engineer to assess the land due to high water table levels, which prevented certain water management solutions.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Mary Abe", "insights": [{"observation": "Mary Abe has maintained a 20-foot vegetative buffer to reduce runoff and plans to regrade her backyard to create a flat area to manage water runoff.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Mary Abe suggested the use of rain barrels and a cistern to help manage water quality and runoff.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Charles Gaddafi", "insights": [{"observation": "Charles Gaddafi experienced significant basement flooding despite having sump pumps, and he believes it may be partially due to runoff from a neighboring property.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "William Warner", "insights": [{"observation": "William Warner discussed implementing a rain garden to manage water runoff and had previously installed a six-foot fence to control noise and fumes from his car.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "William Warner mentioned hiring an engineer to assess the land due to high water table levels, which prevented certain water management solutions.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Mary Abe", "insights": [{"observation": "Mary Abe has maintained a 20-foot vegetative buffer to reduce runoff and plans to regrade her backyard to create a flat area to manage water runoff.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Mary Abe suggested the use of rain barrels and a cistern to help manage water quality and runoff.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Charles Gaddafi", "insights": [{"observation": "Charles Gaddafi experienced significant basement flooding despite having sump pumps, and he believes it may be partially due to runoff from a neighboring property.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 6277892, "chunk_end_time": 6770560, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3554?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3554?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=6277"}, {"start": 64000, "end": 70000, "text": "t that there's six inches of gravel throughout my driveway, and has been for 25 years now.

This started last year at about this time, and it's still going on. So that's kind of where I'm at at this point, is just to try to get the shelter up and we turn the page from there. Okay. Anything else we need to put on the record? Not for me. This is Mary Abe, again. I am. I am confirming that at the meeting we did agree to this, but basically we were told by our review board that if Mister Werner moved the carport over, he really wouldn't even need a variance. And so that's why we stopped the negotiations on that. That said, you know, the county has the ultimate authority to permit or not, and that's the reality. So you know, I don't have a problem. My greatest, the only reason I'm here tonight is to voice my concern for a potentially large permanent structure to be replacing that carport in the future. And that's why I am here. That's why I don't want that to happen. We understand. This is board member Hill. I just have one question. When you say large permanent structure, what type of structure are you talking about? Let's say Mister Warner sells the house and he sells it to somebody who says, I'm going to turn that into, I'm going to put an addition onto my house or I'm going to make a real, like a studio, a brick studio. I'm going to pop that bad boy up because I've already got it there and now, you know, I've got it. And so I'm going to double. I'm going to triple. I'm going to mcMansion it. And that, that's my concern. And it could turn out to be very architecturally beautiful. But I. But it may not be. And so that's, that's my problem is when you're, you have a footprint and you do this, you, you are setting a precedence that something else can go there because it's already impervious. It's 100% roofed. And that's fine. And that's where my concern comes, is that, and that's, that's fine. He is asking for a permit for all sides open carport. Right. But when he goes, if somebody else buys the land or he decides at some point in the future they have to get permitted if they want to put any walls up. And that goes through the neighborhood. And so I guess that's my question is, so if somebody wanted to do that because he got the variance, it would just be a matter of the person just going through the steps? Or would you say that this would go through another variance process to get that type of structure up? Another variance process. Okay, that. Thank you, ma'am. That helps me because that would mean that we would have another. Another way that changes my perspective to know that. Okay. Thank you. William Warner. Can I add one more thing? Sure. Just to satisfy anybody's thoughts, I don't plan on selling or moving. I'm probably going to live out my life here with my wife and my child. Don't plan on leaving. But if I was to leave, I would take my carport with me and take the concrete foundations up and put it at my new chunk of land, bigger and better than this property, if ever that day comes. I don't plan to enclose it. I don't plan to build a building out of it. My intent is to cover up my cars. Now, you know, I'm still going to have to use car covers because this carport can't have permanent fixed sides to it. But, you know, my old tents had complete coverage for my cars for protection. They didn't ever have to live in car covers, which hold water and rust out the car. So my intent is not to enclose this building ever. And if I was to move, I'm taking it with me. I've got so much money at this point tied up in all of this, that it's coming with me. That's my best friend Carport. So just for the record, my intent is not to enclose that building or grandfather it in later, that I can do something different with it. The other people that buy the house, if ever they could, they could not have that chance because it won't be there. It'll be a side yard with gravel. Okay. Anything else? That's it for me. I'd like to take, make a motion to take this under advisement. This boy, Rice. Chairman. Yes. Are we still going to wait for the letter and final recommendations from the city of Mount Rainier? We did get it, but I want to go back to Mount Rainier. Can we get a second on the motion? Did you see. Wait, did you see the letter? Mister Isler? I found the letter. It sounded like they were. We. They were going to submit an additional letter. Well, I thought it just said they approved it. Can we pull it up again, Olga? But I did want to make. I did want to go back with them with a question.

You soundly square firm under the penalties of perjury, that the responses given and statements made will be the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Yeah. Yes. Yes, I do. Okay. Which. Who is going to start out telling us what you're proposing? I think Mister Anthony. Well, yes, ma'am. Well, our proposal, as you can see, the variance was to. Was to have the 3ft separation from the existing driveway that was actually put in without permit, which. Which made our driveway have to have an angle on it because they have to have a three foot separation from the property next door. But their driveway came over because the skirt to the street came, came, came over Misses Brown's property. So then we could not make our property straight, as you can see. I see you have the plans up. Yes. Do you? It doesn't seem that you have a copy. I sent Miss Barlow a copy of the new plan. The new revised plans with the retainer wall on it. Miss Barlow. It should be a reminder at the end. She's coming. So, we're hearing this again because it didn't have the retaining wall on the first one. Yes, ma'am. You all wanted us to put the retaining wall on the plant and get that approved? Madam chair, the approval now states, okay, for construction. 35 by ten driveway. And looks like 17 by three wall walkway with stairs. Right. So if you need a retaining wall, what are you doing to keep the water from running over to your neighbor's driveway? Well, the water will never make it. When we put that wall there, we're going to have. We're going to have the weep holes in it. So it's going. The water gonna soak into the ground, come out, the holes go straight down to the street. So no water is going to even come over to the neighbor. Left or right?

Yes, on the left side of the house, the right side of the house, facing the house on the street, is a driveway next to misses Brown's property. Okay. Do the unit that's attached to the one you're working on. Do they have a driveway? Yes, ma'am. But it's on the left side of their house. So it's yard in between misses Brown's house and their house. And then their driveway is on the other side, the left side of their house. I don't know if you have a picture. You should have a picture of Misses Brown's house. We have a front view, but it doesn't give much of the neighbor. Oh, wait a minute. If we look at exhibit, must be 20. But I can't see the neighbor's driveway. Yeah, well, when you see the sign, uh, the neighbor on the left side, this is boarding right. So the aerial photos show it a little bit, but it's not a great picture of it. Exhibit a. Ha. Sorry. It may be an eight b but there's no square around the house to know which one is Miss Brown's. Why did you owe me the driveway? Because she is 84 years old. This is Gail Duggar, misses Brown's daughter. He's 84 years old and there is very limited parking. She's currently independent and we want to continue to maintain that. And so when she comes home later in the evening, there is. She has to walk from, you know, up the block or down the street. So she drives? Yes, she does. And on top of that, you know, she uses a cane. How long has she been living there? How long has she been living here? Since 1966. And when she moved around here, I would say probably in the last ten years driveways have been put into people's yards. So it wasn't always driveways in the neighborhood. Some people get more than one. So even the neighbors that have a driveway. Can we just have one person speaking at a time, please, so it won't interrupt our taping? Yes, this is Gail Duggar. Again. Even some of the neighbors that have driveways, they still tend to park their cars on the street. So they may have two and three vehicles per house. At least this is open parking in the neighborhood. That is correct. No permits are required. Oh, no, I'm sorry. Yes, permits are required. Yes, because the subway is closed close by. Once they built the nail road subway station, then permits were required. And do you all have permits? She does have a permit. Okay. She does live alone. And do you know how many cars are permitted for each home? Excuse me. I think it's based on your registration. Board members, this is attorney Garner. Please keep in mind the requirements. Yes. Is the size of the property different from others in the neighborhood? This is Gail Duggar. No. Do all your neighbors have as steep a hill in the front yard as you do next to Higginbottom and Lita's house. I don't know if you heard that. She said that there were two houses that have the steep hill, but they don't have driveways. Okay. Is that two on the street or in the neighborhood? On the street. Okay, so I believe one is across the street, and then one is maybe two or three doors down. Thank you. Mister Eisler, the photograph or the aerial on the screen, I'm not sure which one is their house. But if you see the white van to the right of that has a retaining wall along the sidewalk, then the house next to that to the right does have a retaining wall. The house next to that, there's a retaining wall in the front. I don't know if that's a fence or a retaining wall. Yeah, seriously, it looks like a fence, though. I mean. Yes, but I see what you're saying. Yeah. So the street is grading down. Any other questions or concerns we need to put on the record? This is Mister Henderson. Not from me. Board members. Nothing from board authority? No questions. Board member Austin. Madam chair, I do have one question. Miss Gail, you said that there are parking permits. That parking permit. Does that require you to park in a certain parking space or that just means you can park on the street? Yeah, it just means you could park on the street. I believe it's from 08:00 a.m. from 07:00 a.m. to 06:00 p.m. monday through Friday, excluding holiday. Okay, thank you. Any other points we need to put on the record? No. Did you have something you want to put on the record, Mister Herson? No, no, no. Everything is okay, your honor. All right, thank you. Miss Hill, did you have anything not to spawn. Miss Brown, did we hear you go on the record? Did you have anything you wanted to ask Miss Hillary Brown? No. Okay. I'd like to make a motion that we take this under advisement. Second boisler.

Excuse me. Are you interpreting for your father? Yes. Okay. We cannot allow that. Any interpretation must be by a certified interpreter. Okay, sure. Does he not speak English? No, he does. Okay. Yes. Okay, ma'am. And my street, we only have a one side parking and other side, we don't have a parking. And most of time, night time, we don't have a parking. I drive Uber. My daughter also work in a north, north face. And we, when we come home, we don't have a parking. So sometime we park all the way back. So also I have open heart surgery and my health is no good. So I talk to with the spanish guy to make a driveway, little bill. I want to open the driveway so I can park my other car. And I asked him, do I need a permit for that? He said, do you pay home situation fee? I said, no. And then say, then he said, you don't need that. I say, you, you are sure? This is my first time, sir? And he said, I promise with you, you don't need. I pay him $2,900 to extend my driveway. So after one and a half year, I received the letter. I talked to Mister Green, and I said, what I have to do. You want me to remove my driveway? Like, no problem, I can do that, sir. Apologize. I didn't know the rules. And he said, go ahead, try, go to Pepper mill office and try there and make your map.

And this and that. If they prove, they will let you keep the parking lot. Otherwise, you have to remove it. And this is my innocent mistake. I apologize for that. If you want, I can remove it.

So it's up to you. I apologize. I. I didn't know the rules, and this is my first time. And if you don't want me to keep the driveway, I can remove it.

He charged me $2,900. No, he don't respond to me. Don't never pick up the phone. And if you. Ma'am, I don't want to be make a trouble. And if you don't want me to keep that driveway, I can remove it. And I talked to other contractor, he said he gonna charge me $1500 plus $300 to put the grass on with the white car standing there. He said I'm gonna be put there and look same way used to be. It's up to you, ma'am. It's up to you. No problem for me. This is board member Eisler. Miss Olga, could you go to exhibit ten f? I just want to confirm that this is. I'm sorry, I cannot hear you. Well, say that again please. Exhibit ten f. Exhibit ten. Okay, hold on. Ten f as in frame ten f. It is this. What the. This is board member Eisler. Mister Muhammad, is this what the house used to look like before the driveway extension was installed? Yes. Yes. I have a two time heart surgery and diabetes. And I cannot walk. You know that much. So sometime, sir, I park two block back there, three block back there. And it's also dangerous, you know, I mean, to walk in the midnight. So that's why I do that. But the guy, the contractor, he lied to me. And you don't need a permit. And I'm telling you, I swear I'm telling you true. And he never pick up my phone. I left a message. Why are you lying to me then? He never pick up the phone. Have you applied for a building permit yet or driveway permit yet? Oh, I go. There are 31 time I go to Mister Barbara office. You can lady Spanish there. And she said, I fill up all my paper there for. And they said first you have to. They will explain them in Zoom meeting and if they want you to keep them on, then you can get the permit for that. But I don't know. Excuse me, the thing about it is I am Barbara Stone, okay? Yes, ma'am, I am. I am with the board of appeals. I am not with the department of Permanent Inspection and Enforcement. And that's where you need to go to apply for a driveway permit. Which office? Which office, ma'am? I am with the board of appeals. You need to go to DPI or department of permitting, inspection and enforcement to apply for a driveway permit, an apron permit. So I don't have. I do not have a address for that where I go. I can go tomorrow with my daughter, no problem. But I don't. I. Can you email me or give me the address right now? I can write it down and I go there.

Under the penalties of perjury, that the responses given and statements made will be the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I do. Mister Swan, could you tell me if he has applied for a driveway permit? Mister Muhammad applied for a driveway permit in November of 2023 review. Do you know that? Well, the status of that permit. It's still under review. This is. Even though he applied for a permit, he still needs a variance to waive the parking area requirements since the driveway extension is in the front of the house. Is that correct, mister? Yes, but he needs a site road approval. We need to get the approved site road stamped plans. Should we? Prince George county, if I can interject. Yes, please. It looks like it was approved December 15. Oh, okay. The site roads. Look at our criteria. I believe so. And that's probably why he is here. He probably doesn't recall that they asked him to get a variance because it's parked in front of the house. Yes, I get it. So actually, the best thing to do is to have him submit a copy of that plan. But he still has to meet the criteria of the variance. No. Is it a charge to go to site roads? Well, if he's already gotten his permit, we just need a copy of it so we could possibly obtain it from site roads. So maybe the best thing to do is to reschedule until we can get those plans. I'd like to make a motion that we continue. Or should we just hold it open if we're just getting the plans? Well, we still need to determine if the criteria has been met, so I'll leave it up to you. If you still want testimony from the petitioner or Mister Swan, or if we hold it open, we. There will be no more. No further testimony or evidence submitted other than, you know, the approved site road plan. And at that point we can determine if he meets the criteria. Do we think we need additional testimony? No, we'll just substitute motion. Okay, let them make a motion that we just hold this open for additional documentation. Second board member Reichmann. Thank you, madam Chair. Mister Eisler? Aye. Miss Alston? Aye. Miss Hill. Hi. Thank you. Motion carries 40. Thank you all. So, Mister Muhammad, what we're going to do there is an approved driveway permit, but we have to have that in our files. So what we're going to do is we're going to contact site road to get a copy of that plan, and then we will rehear your case or look at the revised. Excuse me. Look at the approved plans from site Road and let you know what the decision is. God bless you, ma'am. Thank you so much, ma'am. And I have one question. Man. If. Ma'am, if you don't mind. Also I received the quote letter of me and for my. My wife, August 14. They asked me to come in a quote. So what I have to do for that. That letter. Madam chair, did you want to. I'm sorry. Question again. I'm sorry. There is a letter from Forest Heights violation, and we did not read that into the file. Miss Garner, do we need to reopen the case to read that or isn't a part of the record? Since it is part of the record. But we've already voted. Yeah, well, it's part of the record that the paper record, not testimony. So anything that's part of the record can still be considered by the board whether or not it was not. Madam chair, excuse me. Did you want me to read it into the record? You've already voted. Yes. And I would. I would suggest that the board members read that on your own and. And see if that. And take that into consideration at the next hearing. But when we get his additional documents, we'll also look at this. Okay, that works. Says it's already in the record. Okay. So, Mister Sheik, you don't have to come back. We will advise you of the decision of the board. Oh, okay. Okay, ma'am. Thank you so much, ma'am. He doesn't have to put a court rate. That's what he's trying to ask. No, no, no, no. Well, I don't know. He may have to go in regards to the violation from forest heights, but I don't think we have any oversight over that. Correct, Miss Garner? We don't. And we also should not be advising. We're not his attorneys, so we should not be advising what he should or should not be going. But is for this case. I mean, it is for this case, but do they not do. They're not, like, correlate with each other? Well, what we normally do is we read the letter or the violation from forest heights and then take that into consideration for our decision.

And good evening also to your fellow board members and staff. For the record, my name is Tracy Scudder and this evening I have the pleasure of representing the applicant and property owner in this case Mister Shalabi, who is present and who also happens to be a licensed civil engineer. And my legal assistant Terry Myers is also present. And I know you've already sworn them in, so I'll just proceed. Let me give one break. I did want to introduce you to our new attorney, Miss Garner. Yes, nice to meet you Miss Garner. Nice to meet you as well, Miss Garner. Welcome aboard. Thank you. Okay, so the request. Thank you Miss Mac. So the request that is before you all, b 23 24 is in regard to 4711 Man street. There are two lots, lots 16 and 17. The project is for an infill development to build to construct a single family dwelling on these two lots. The lots are located in one of the county's older subdivisions and I think this subdivision was created. It's called the Dean Wood park subdivision and it has been in existence since 1927, obviously before any zoning regulations and subdivision regulations came into effect. The lots, the property is made up of two long, narrow, rectangular vacant lots that total 3780 sqft. They're in the within the boundaries of the 2018 approved greater Cheverly sector plan and approved subregion four master plan and sectional map amendment. The property is owned r 55. Now, there is a little bit of a discrepancy. I'm going to back up a little bit to your worksheet. I'm looking at page 26 of the binder.

Thank you Miss Mac. So the request that is before you all, b 23 24 is in regard to 4711 Man street. There are two lots, lots 16 and 17. The project is for an infill development to build to construct a single family dwelling on these two lots. The lots are located in one of the county's older subdivisions and I think this subdivision was created. It's called the Dean Wood park subdivision and it has been in existence since 1927, obviously before any zoning regulations and subdivision regulations came into effect. The lots, the property is made up of two long, narrow, rectangular vacant lots that total 3780 sqft. They're in the within the boundaries of the 2018 approved greater Cheverly sector plan and approved subregion four master plan and sectional map amendment. The property is owned r 55. Now, there is a little bit of a discrepancy. I'm going to back up a little bit to your worksheet. I'm looking at page 26 of the binder. The house at 30 by 42, totaling twelve 60 sqft is correct. But the driveway is ten by 25, not ten by 20. So the total square footage for the driveway would be 250. Then with regard to the proposed sun room, that's four by six. I believe that square footage should be subtracted from the request because I believe our engineer sent in a revised plan. He's not going to cover. The porch is not going to be covered. It's going to be uncovered. And I think that may be in your record. But I think the 24 sqft should, should be subtracted so that we would then have a total of, instead of 1484 total lot coverage, that number would become 1510. And then the math, it kind of works out to like 39.9%. So we're asking for 40%. And instead of the 9% variance, it would be a 10% variance. Okay. Miss Cutter, what size did you say the driveway was? Ten by 25. Thank you. And then again, the porch and sunroom uncovered. Okay. And so I'll move along. I did submit a statement of justification into the record which addresses all the legal criteria for approval of these requested variances. But if you'd like, Miss Mac, I can go through the variances really quick. But I think the worksheet probably explains it all. But by way of background, the owner purchased the subject property, these two empty lots, in December of 2023 with the intent of improving these vacant lots with a newly constructed split foyer dwelling with a one car garage. These variances are the minimum necessary to afford relief. So there's a total of three variances. One for the 10% SGD. Well, three variances, 1220 sqft with regard to net lot area. Then there's a 10% net lot coverage variance requested and a four foot rear yard depth. And so these variances would be needed in order to complete the building permit process. And without approval of these variances, the property would be unable to meet the zoning requirements. I'll touch a little bit on, you know, some of the legal criteria for approval. As I just mentioned, the two lots that comprise this application are exceptionally long and narrow and small in size. The block itself that these lots are on, it's exactly a triangle shaped block. And if you look at it from a global view, the block is, like, very irregular and triangular shaped. And so, at the time, these lots were likely created sometime around 1927. They were made to fit inside this irregular, triangular shaped block. So that's kind of what caused them to be long and narrow in shape. And again, as I mentioned earlier, the creation of these lots preceded, you know, many subdivision and zoning regulations that existed this today, including minimum lot size requirements. So it's just not feasible for, you know, lots that were created, you know, 100 years ago to, you know, when there were no requirements to comply with, you know, the very many standards that exist today. So that's what brings us before you this evening, and we. We are happy to answer any questions that you all may have. Again, I submitted, the statement of justification is in the binder. One more thing I would like to mention, though, is that the request is. And this is in the statement of justification, but it is in compliance and in harmony with the various plans plan. Prince George's 2035, which is the approved general plan for the county. It's in compliance with the approved sector plan and the approved master plan for this area. Planning areas 72, 75 A and 75 b are the ones that are applicable. But I just like to say that these plan, this particular proposal lists many of the goals and meets many of the goals and policies of these plans, such as to provide a variety of housing options, ranging in price, density, ownership, and type, and to preserve existing culture and historic resources by strengthening the expression of local identity, enhance the sector plan and area sense of place, and to provide a comfortable, healthy, safe and pleasant environment in which to live, work, and play. And then there are other goals that I'll list in the statement of justification that are noteworthy that, you know, again, this application does comply with those. So with that being said, you know, in that none of the policies and goals are hampered by this application, I think the proposal does meet the legal criteria for approval of a variance. And so with that being said, I will now turn it over to you, Chairlady Mac, and the board for any questions. Madam Chair, I do want to note that this property is being reviewed under the prior zoning ordinance. This is not the current zoning ordinance. And while I still have the floor, I know there are a lot of people who are going to speak. Anyone who speaks prior to you speaking, please state your name prior to speaking. In order for us to transcribe these, the testimony, we have to know who's speaking. So please state your name before you speak. Thank you. Okay, we have a list of folks that want to speak tonight.

Madam Chair, I do want to note that this property is being reviewed under the prior zoning ordinance. This is not the current zoning ordinance. And while I still have the floor, I know there are a lot of people who are going to speak. Anyone who speaks prior to you speaking, please state your name prior to speaking. In order for us to transcribe these, the testimony, we have to know who's speaking. So please state your name before you speak. Thank you. Okay, we have a list of folks that want to speak tonight. So let me start with our speakers. Harrison. Miss Harrison, did you have something you wanted to add to the record? You have a question for me? Do you have any answers for us? Any answers? What question do you have regarding this? She wants to know. She wants to know your view, your position. Your position. Oh, well, I've been here over ten years, and this lot has been vacant since then. But the current resident, Miss Belling, has really been taking care of it and keeping it up. The current resident? Yes, the current resident next door, Miss Belling or neighbor. Not the owner of the property? No. Okay. But she's been taking care of the property since she's been here, and we really take care of our properties on this street. So for her to come and be a neighboring person and really look out for the property, you know, it was. It was welcome and it was really, you know, helpful. But other than that, I don't. I don't understand. But if it's enough room. If there's enough space for a house. I know I don't see it, but that's really all I have to say at this point. Okay. If I could add. Chairwoman Mac. My name is Courtney. C o r t n e y. Fisher. The petitioner in question purchased this lot in December 2023, understanding that it was a small lot that was subdivided 100 years ago, as the attorney mentioned, and didn't seem to concern himself with the fact that this is a lot. That is, the house that he is attempting to put on the lot is very large in proportion to the lot itself, leaving very little room between the house and the abutting neighbors. And so it wasn't as if he owned this property. You know, one of our neighbors has been here since this 1960s. He has not owned this property for a very long time. He purchased it with the intention of trying to circumvent the rule, the zoning ordinances of the county, to build his property. So that is my concern. Is it smaller than your lot? It is, yes. And my house is far smaller. One third of the size of the proposed house. Okay. Thank you for your comments. Miss. Sykes. Mister Sykes? Yes. Charles Sykes. I live at 4710 Main street, directly across in front of the proposed property. And the property, the house, the proposal would be much larger than that lock can accommodate. Yeah, it shall be. When you say much larger. Width wise or height wise? Width, width and length, because it's going to overextend the size of the land. This is Kate Belling. Just to clarify Mister Sykes's comment here, the lot size is about 40 sqft between my property and my neighbors at 4709. And the proposal is for a 30 square foot house. Which means that even though it's not mentioned in this particular variance request, the setback requirement between lots is 8. They're only going to allow anywhere between three and 4 sqft. Which means that when I open my window, I will be able to physically touch their house because of how close they are proposing to build it, so to speak. To Mister Sykes comment about how the size of the house does not fit the property, I wanted to just put in the side setbacks that are not mentioned in this particular variance request in front of the board. I'm not certain if Mister Sykes has anything additional he would like to add before I continue on my, my thoughts, I will pass the. Pass it back to Mister Sykes again. The proposed building would be much larger than that lot. Please state your name before you speak. Hold on. Charles Sykes. Thank you. The proposed property would not be able to accommodate the building they're planning to correct. And you're aware of the building there? The plans for the building? Yes, I received the letter from the zoning board and I've seen pictures. Okay. Thank you very much, Mister Mule. Hi, yes. Daniel Muley Mulc. Thank you, chair, for the opportunity to speak. I share the concerns that have been shared so far about the development that's been proposed. And I do think that the proposed lot coverage does not align with the requirements outlined in the zoning ordinance and would encroach on the privacy and enjoyment by the adjacent property owners and would impact the character of the neighborhood in general. In fact, because the petitioner is asking for a rear yard depth variance to our, our privacy would be directly encroached. And I think there are. The proposed single family home also raises additional concerns about straining local infrastructure on a street that is busy with additional street parking as well. I also share some, some concerns about the construction of homes in the neighborhood that don't. That are often left unfinished. And we've seen that happen repeatedly on the block recently. And this is, I think, a problem and a challenge all around. But the construction that we've seen has also had significant impacts on construction debris around the block and around the impact of. On local trees in the neighborhood as well.

On local trees in the neighborhood as well. Just last month in April, our councilwoman Jolene Ivy for district five and the Community association Chapel Oaks Community association did a walkthrough and commented on some of these concerns already. Adding another site on this block would additionally impact the local community. In addition, I wanted to comment on the potential for tree removal on the property, particularly with the rear yard variance should petitioners propose variants be approved and I want to stress here that the Chapel Oaks community has historically had a larger tree canopy that helps support the adjoining creeks and provide critical shade to the area. The creeks feed into the Anacostia river watershed and removing more trees will severely have an environmental impact that has already been felt in the area. Construction and redevelopment of properties in the area has severely diminished the number of trees, and that's evident from the historical aerials, and in the last few years, trees have been chopped down on on nearly every neighboring property on the block and adjacent to 4711 man trees in the area. Of course, it does contribute to reduction in property values, but it exacerbates urban heat. Highland effect leaves fewer habitats for birds and local fauna, and it negatively impacts our storm water runoff in the area. The county has already recognized the importance of this and supported new or the importance of trees in the area and supported new tree plantings via the rain check program. But these trees can't compare to the much older trees that are under threat from this development as well. And I stress this in part because while I understand that this petitioner is applying under the old zoning and has just barely met the the timing for the transition period to do so after buying the property just a little over five months ago, I do want to recognize that the current zoning, RSF 640 does also include among its purposes to encourage the preservation of trees and open spaces and to prevent soil erosion and stream valley flooding, currently there are at least four, maybe five large trees on the property that may be impacted by this development, as I understand, and our backyard already floods with runoff from neighboring properties flowing this way and the block itself. This triangular block that was described is on an incline, it is on a hill, and so runoff from neighboring properties flows downhill onto our property and to others. Greater impervious surfaces on this property, especially with those requested variances and the extensive lot cover, the rear variance as well, will substantial will create stronger risks of greater flooding for us and our neighbors and overall impede our enjoyment and use of the proper of our adjacent properties. And again, as was mentioned earlier, I do want to just stress that this property was purchased in December with all of its property limitations noted, but according to public record, for a price of less than $10,000, I have to believe that that price does reflect the fact that the impediments to development on this property were well known by petitioner before they undertook this effort to get a variance under the old zoning at the very last moment. I also have had zero contact with the petitioner that has not. They have not come to have a conversation about the impacts that this development would have or their need for any of these variances. I think at minimum, they should be having conversations with neighbors first prior to coming to variance and trying to build something that is out of line with neighborhood character and would adversely impact all of the adjacent property owners. Thank you for your time, and I appreciate you hearing me out. Are you in the town? Are you all in a town? No. No. This is unincorporated PG county. It's considered Capitol Heights by mailing district, but it's not part of Capitol Heights as an incorporated township. Okay, thank you. Can we put up exhibit e while we're d? I'm sorry?

Well, while we're waiting, let's get Miss Belling. Miss Belling? Yes. My name is Kate Belling. As I mentioned earlier, I live directly next to. I'm an abutting property owner next to this. This particular development. Since I. Since I joined the neighborhood two years ago, I have been maintaining the lot. I have taken care of the lawn, I have taken care of everything. The weeds, the bushes, you name it, I have taken care of it partially due to the fact that I didn't want the grass to be overgrown for pests that already are potentially prevalent in the neighborhood to continue, but also because it is literally right next to my house and the ability for me to enjoy my property relies on the condition of the property next to me. As noted by my fellow neighbors, the property is very small. So as I stated earlier, it is no more than 40 sqft across the proposal is for a 30 square foot house to be with house to be built. Additionally, the lot size, you know, the 25 foot square foot setback that is required from the street based off of the design and the drawing, and the 42 foot square foot request for the length of the house would not also abide by the 25 foot square foot setback requirement per the zoning requirements, although also not stated in this particular variance request. I am aware of these setbacks based off of how my property is currently positioned and based off of how I encountered my property upon purchase. And in addition to that, as far as enjoyment, you may or may not be able to tell. So that is, the picture currently shown is not my house. I'm on the other side. However, you will note that there is a series of windows on the side of my house. And with the building of this particular house and this property that the petitioner is requesting, I will lose 100% of the natural light into the side of my house for that floor. They're the only windows that provide natural light to that part of my house. And it will be completely covered by a wall that I mentioned I could physically touch with my hand due to how close the proximity to the property line would be needed in order for him to the petitioner to build the property that he is proposing. That also being said, I would like to echo my neighbor Daniel Muley's point of at no point did the petitioner seek to speak to any of the neighbors. At no point since the purchase in December of 2023, did the buyer have the courtesy to come out and look at the property or try to maintain the property I have. In this calendar year of 2024, I have mowed the lawn no fewer than 15 times due to the excess heat and also rain that we have received in the area. And at no point did the petitioner attempt to come and maintain or take care of the property since purchase. I would just like to echo my neighbors in stating that the lot is far too small and there are zoning requirements that I don't believe that what should water should allow for a property of this size to be built on a lot that is approximately half the size of my lot. Okay. Were you able to pull up any other pictures, Miss Olga? Yes, exactly which one you want to see? I think it was nine e. It's the aerial photos. Nine D. I think nine B. Okay. D as in okay. Okay. Let me find first the number of exhibit number. It's the aerial photographs. The aerial photograph. Okay. Much better than exhibit nine. Yes. Hold on. Let coverage. Aerial photo 9d, as in dog. Okay. D. Look at that one. We can look at that one first. You can look at this one. Okay. I will enlarge for you, Miss Belling, which is your house next to. To the right of the blue vouchers. My house is on the. Like, the right? Yes. Where it says street. Sorry. Are you on a double lot? They're all double lots. Every house on this triangle block is a double lot. And for the record, I would like to expand on Mister Mullet's statement of ongoing construction on the. On the blocks. So I believe Mister Mulle and Mister Sanchez live in the house with the number five. If you look to the right of number five, which is behind, you know, the abutting property from behind. If you look at the house to the right of number five, as well as the one that is cut off in the. In the. Where the tip of the triangle would go. Where the angle of the triangle would go. Both of those properties are currently under construction and have been under construction for at least eight years. At least eight or nine years since my neighbors have moved in. And so that is just to point out to the board some of the concern of the ongoing construction on our specific block that has gone unfinished and. Or could potentially infested with pests and other. Other things. Have you all made contact with the owners or the Prince George's county to find out why? I defer to my neighbors on that. I believe that they have, but I do not want to speak for them. Okay. Can we go down one more photo? Sure. Come on. Okay, so this is the lot in the middle. Okay. These are the trees you're talking about on this photo that would have to be removed. Yeah. We could see it there, too. Yes. That's capturing some of the trees. Yes. And on the construction issues. I know that. Yes. This is Javi, sensualist 1121. Your voice is kind of muffled. What was it again? Javi Sanchez. Okay. Uh huh. Okay. Eastern Avenue. I mean, 21. Sorry. Yes. Yes. So sorry. You have comments. Yes. So, in regards to the construction next to us, that has been construction that has been going on off and on, I have submitted three one one calls to the county about the lot being vacant and debris just all over the yard.

I also found a dead mouse in the back of the yard. Is this the builder? That's the one that's next to us. Is this builder the same one that's proposing the new one that we're talking about? No, it does have. It has no relation to the deliver, but it's just a concern that unregulated construction going on in our block on a very predominant eastern ave, border DC, you know, so that's the, that's my argument there. Okay, thank you. Any other comments for me from you? Yes, ma'am. The attorney mentioned that, you know, cited a 1927 zoning ordinance. It is 2024 to cite, you know, decades old zoning ordinances to deliver on a very, very tiny, small lot that is just unsatisfactory right there. She also cited living, working and playing other. With other county zoning or development plans. We are also concerned about living, working and playing in our own backyard in regards to our property at 1121 Eastern Ave. This new construction would be 4ft, about 4ft to the backyard of the rear. So basically we wouldn't have any enjoyment, we wouldn't have any privacy if the deliverer decides to shop down the trees that are very vital for the Watts branch Creek that's underneath the eastern avenue that goes into the greater Anacostia watershed. Also, there is also water drainage issues. So just want to also echo both Kate and the rest of the neighbors on Man street that all of those concerns that I also share with them. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, we have. Mister Roger. Sorry. She's coming. She had stepped to the other room. She's here. State your name. Dietra Rogers. Yes, ma'am. I just want to be some support to the neighbors. We're all very pretty close, and that lot, as everybody is saying, is we really visually can't see a structure being put into that space. Other than that, I mean, people have really talked about, you know, taking away the beauty of our block. I just. That's basically just what I wanted to say. Well, suppose that structure wasn't as wide as yours. Suppose the structure wasn't as wide as the lot. Your house? My house. I don't know where you are yet, but I'm across the street, 4712. Directly across the street, 4712. Okay, sorry. This is Kate Belling. Just to clarify your question, are you saying, so you want us to imagine a house that isn't as wide, but maybe taller? And if that's the case, I would like to interject that a building of this nature recently unfortunately went up not too far away in our neighborhood that has no windows on two sides of the house and is much larger and very difficult to look at because it doesn't fit within the neighborhood. So if the proposal. If the board is proposing or questioning whether or not the. The petitioner should therefore, you know, narrow out the lot in order to have the height increase, I think the opposition in the neighborhood would stand? Well, there's a maximum height, regardless of. Correct. Okay. Did I get Miss Celeste? No, that's me, Celeste Franco. Okay. Also, just in case, my maiden name is the one that any documentation would have been sent out to. So my maiden name is Battaracco. B a d a r a c c o. Just in case. That's important. And you had some comments? Yes. So we are at 4709. So we're the other neighbor. We're the grey house that we were looking at for a little while and a few things, but the big thought I just had was, if we're talking about, you know, the neighborhood was built in 1924, adhering to, like, historical, historically, nothing has ever stood on that lot. There is no previous structure, there is no previous foundation. And we have members of our neighborhood who have been here or who have had family here for many, many years. So, the history of the neighborhood, and following along with the history from 1924, is that they saw that that lot was too small to hold a dwelling, particularly the size of the house that is currently proposed. It will be just far too wide, as well as far too long for what the lot is. I mean, we can see from the picture that the proposal is larger than my house as it stands. Size wise. If you look at the lot plan that we were all sent, you can see the size of the proposed house in comparison to my house from the 1940s. Look at it right now. Can we bring up the plans, Miss Olga? And by larger, I'm sorry, I should clarify. I mean, much longer, taking up much more of that important space on the lot. There's an exhibit six. It gives you kind of a footprint of how it would go in there. Exhibit six. Exhibit six, yeah. It's like a photo. It's like a photo. Okay. Unfortunately, I don't have the exhibit number on my right side, so I just photo for the house with photo three at the top, but on the bottom it has exhibit six. There it is.

This is just a picture to show the lot. This is in between the house. This has nothing to do with the house. Okay. This is just a delineation of the approximate delineation of where the lot is. Yes, that's. I was figuring that. Now on exhibit three a, that's all about. Okay. Three a. It's a photo. 402. Elevations. Elevations. Elevations. Okay. Hold on, please. Elevation. Plants. Okay. Here we go. Okay. So that's the front of the house on the bottom, right. So it doesn't look like it's going up high. So we're not concerned about the height. We're concerned about the width and the amount that it's going to encroach on our personal property and the amount of enjoyment and privacy it's going to take from us. That's what we're concerned about. We're not concerned about the height. Yes. Hold on. My husband is going to. What kind of privacy would it take if you have other neighbors around you? Well, if they're three and a half foot from our property line, that's a lot of privacy that it will take away. Yes, go ahead, Roger. Can I say something? My name is Arduo Franco. I'm Celeste. Husband, right? Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Same house. Yeah. Our concern is most mostly with the proximity, with how close it's going to be to our property line. That pretty much, even if it's not tall, it is going to take away all our light that we get in the morning from that side of the house, especially if it's going to be that close. We do have some concerns. It's a little hard to tell from the plans, but depending on where those windows are, we may be looking directly into them, may not. It's a little hard to tell with those plans. Probably our biggest concern regarding our actual property is we have drainage issues in our basement with flooding right now. We have. It's always kind of been like that. We didn't notice until after we bought the house that our basement flooded. We're below grade from that lot right now. Anytime it rains, we got water coming into our window. Well, I have a sump pump in there right now that pumps all the water out. If that's not there, it floods pretty much no matter how much it rains. And that's taking account the fact that it's permeable surface. Right now, it's all grass and dirt. My main concern is what happens when it's just pretty much all impermeable. With the size of that house, it's all roof and shingle and driveway. I don't know where that water is going to go other than my house. So that's my main concern right now. Right now, again, we do have a sump up in that window well, and that does kind of keep it at. We've had some seriously close calls where we could have had major flooding. So that's really my concern is what happens when we take away that permeable lot and put a house, that's all that sheet water from the roof and from the driveway is now coming onto my house. So yeah, that's kind of mostly my main immediate concern when the house is built. Have I missed anyone? Madam chair, this is Barbara. Can I ask Mister Salabi a question, please? Yes, please, Miss Olga, could you go back to the site plan? Just scroll up a little bit. Ziad, what are the building side yard setbacks? I don't see them on the site plan. This is Zia Chalabi. Barbara, if you look at the. If you zoom in, the minimum required setback is 5ft from either side. And they are shown on the front corners of the house from. From both sides. Okay, can you zoom in, Olga? It's 40ft wide, the lot, and the house is 30ft. So that leaves us with five and five on either side. Okay. Because I'm noticing. Excuse me. Both existing houses are very close to the property line. Less than what you're proposing. That's their. That's their issue. That's their, you know, that's. You know, I can't. You know, I can't change that. That's what they are. As far as the lot and what is proposed, you have to meet the minimum setback. As you know, in this case, it's 5ft from the property line. On both sides. On both sides. Okay. I just. I just wanted to clarify that. Absolutely. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Madam chair, this is Courtney Fisher again, 4715 Man Street.

Every person who lives on Man street and the two abutting properties on Eastern Avenue have signed an opposition to this property. We have been on this meeting today since 06:00 p.m. and have listened to far more concern about driveways than we have now. Then we are hearing about this petitioners putting an oversized, far oversized house on a lot that he purchased five years ago. No, five months ago. Five months ago. As. As we mentioned this, as everybody has mentioned, this was a subdivision created in the 1920s. The houses were built in 19. My house was built in 1949. My neighbors in 1947. This petitioner purchased this property with the intention that he was going to break the rules, and that is fundamentally unjust. Okay, I do have. You said you live on the left side of the lot, right? Well, I'm not sure if you're looking at the property I am on. I am two houses from the property. Let me look at exhibit number six again. Miss over. Number six. That is aerial photos. It's a photo. It's photo of the house. Okay. Right there. Whose house is to the left? So to the left, the red brick is mine. Catherine Kate Belling. That is my house. Was that. Is that a garage on the side of it? It's a garage in my kitchen and dining room. And it was built well before, like the forties or fifties. Like it has been there forever. I purchased the house as is, but that is a garage and my kitchen and dining area. Okay. And then the house, just for the record, the house to the. To the. On the other side is Celeste in Rodrigo Franco's house. Courtney, who is next to me, she is on my other side. So the one that she is saying is, you know, 800 sqft above grade is on the other side of the red house. Okay, so to clarify, this is Courtney Fisher. To clarify something that attorney Scudder mentioned about the historical nature of the neighborhood, this is well out of character. Of the historical nature of the neighborhood. Well out of character. It doesn't match any of the houses around it. And again, I'm going to say again, every name neighbor on Man street is in strong opposition to this variance. Okay. Have I missed anyone? I just want to also mention that the Chapel Oaks association is against. Please, we need your name because we have so many voices on our tape. Oh, sorry. Javier Sanchez. Mm hmm. Yeah. So I just wanted to say the community association is strongly against this, deliberate as well as the neighbors. Okay. All right. Anything our board members need to put on the record? Yes. This is board member Alston. I understood. I believe the property in question is a double lot. Is that correct? Yes. Yes. And did all of the thank you, Miss Scudder. And did all of the neighbors say they all have double lots? That's what I heard. That's correct. Okay, so I guess my question is in terms of the size of the dwelling he wants build. Has he already received some permits to go ahead with the plans or. No. Has anyone officially said that what he's trying to build is too big for the lot he has. No, ma'am. This is Ziad Shalabi. No, thank you. Anything else? So what is. Is this an official community organization or hoa in this neighborhood? Yes, it is. This is Courtney Fisher, the Chapel Hoax Community association, incorporated within the last year. And. I'm sorry, what was the name of the Hoa chapel? Oaks. Okay, thank you. Community association. The president is Donnie. D o n n I E. Joyner. Joyner. And this petitioner did not give the community association the courtesy either of any conversation. Okay, so this is board member Austin. My question is, you have the community association. Is there anything official in the record, written officially in the record from your association? I didn't see anything in the record from you all from the association. I can't speak to that. We did. There are. There is a petition with all signatures from Man street and the abutting properties in the record. In what record? And that's what Miss Barlow. Barlow told us, that the. That the petition would be included in the record of everybody's opposition. Actually, we cannot accept petitions within the board of appeals. Well, Miss Barlow, I am the. I'm in the administrator. And I'm sorry if she didn't understand that, but we cannot. And Miss Garner or Mister Watson, you could back me up on that. The board of appeals cannot accept petitions. Well, we don't usually get petitions to begin with, but we get individual letters. We get individual letters, not petitions. Well, Mister Eisler just asked us if there was anything in the record from the community association. What I would assume means. Are you telling us that instead of one letter, you would want each of us to write a letter? We could accept individual letters, but I believe what he was asking. Is there a letter from the association with the opinion of the association in regards to the construction of this home? Yeah, signed by the president of the organization. And just for the record, I think that was just board member Alston's. I'm sorry. Yes, it was board member. Okay, I'm sorry, that would be a question for the president of the organization.

But I just want to say for the board of appeals that it would have been helpful to know before 09:59 p.m. that you were not going to accept the letter that the neighborhood presented to you, Austin, I think you called it a petition. It was a letter with signatures from every single person on Man street. So I'm not sure what you want to phrase that as. Okay, so what I'm saying is that the staff of the board of appeals provided misinformation to the neighbors about what would be allowed and what wouldn't be allowed. Again, she was proud, probably unaware of that fact. Miss Barbara? Yes. Can I respond? Absolutely. The letter was referenced to as a letter. I did see that there were names and, you know, addresses of the neighbors. It was not my intention to mislead you. I viewed it as a letter, but I am also not the administrator. So if the administrator and the board think it's the petition, I would have to go with what they said. But I, at the time of acceptance, viewed it as a letter. Okay, well, every one of you, all who have spoken are party of record. We can assure you of that. Miss board member Austin, I want to agree and say absolutely your concerns are on the record. Any other comments we need to put on the record? Hi, this is Daniel Muley, 1121 Eastern Ave. If I may, I was just wanted to clarify on that. So if there was a letter that may be a petition that was signed by many members of the neighborhood, is the substance of that letter also on the record in some form? If not, is it worthwhile to read that into the record on this call as well, just to ensure that the substance of that letter can be taken into account? Since it was the shared view of so many people in the neighborhood, I would defer that to our attorney, either Miss Garner or Alice Watson. So I think each person on here can stay on the record, what their positions are, which I believe most of you have already done. I don't know that someone who is not here to be morning and basically testify about what was written, like on behalf of the organization, should be presented. And that's pretty much why we don't accept petitions. Right. Well, part of the issue, if this is Courtney Fisher, part of the issue is that there are neighbors who believed their voices would be put on the record, because that is the information we received from the staff. So they can certainly. They can certainly write a letter and they could have registered to speak. What I'm saying is, because of the misinformation provided by the office, they did not register to speak. They relied on the fact that their information would be put on the record. I would say you could submit that to your HOA and let the homeowners association make, you know, write up a letter. Is the letter written from, is it signed and written by the hOa? Or is it just a petition signed by various homeowners? It is a. This is Courtney Fisher that. What I'm referencing is a letter that is signed by the homeowners that abut this property on Man street, and then the abutting properties on Eastern Avenue, which is Mister Mullay. Mister Sanchez and I believe one of their neighbors who relied upon that letter to have her views stated today. There are also at least two, three neighbors, four neighbors that I'm thinking of on Man street that were not here tonight because they relied on the information provided by Miss Stone's office. And so what I'm saying is there is a fundamental lack of fairness because those folks did not come here tonight in reliance on the information we receive. Okay, I understand the board can decide whether or not they want to hold the matter open so that the homeowners who are not present here has an opportunity to submit something. But we can't. They're not here to testify in open court. And so we keep this. We can't accept. So, Miss Garner, this is Javi Sanchez, Javier Sanchez. I'm a founding member of the community association. And I saw that letter, I signed that letter. And though the president of the association is not present here, he signed that letter. But it's not from the association. Right. You know, we can just. We have to apologize for that. But as you know, when you come in here and you testify, we have to swear your testimony in. It can't be hearsay. Sure. Miss, this is Kate Belling. As an author of the letter, can I read the letter from you? Sure. Okay, so I'm going to read it. Go ahead, if that's allowed. Okay. Thank you. Dear members of the board, we are writing to express our strong opposition to the zoning building permit application for the proposed single family home located at 4711 Main Street, Capital Heights, Maryland. As adjoining property owners, neighbors, and community members, we are deeply concerned about the potential negative impacts this development could have on the surrounding properties, characters of the neighborhood, and the community as a whole.

Dear members of the board, we are writing to express our strong opposition to the zoning building permit application for the proposed single family home located at 4711 Main Street, Capital Heights, Maryland. As adjoining property owners, neighbors, and community members, we are deeply concerned about the potential negative impacts this development could have on the surrounding properties, characters of the neighborhood, and the community as a whole. First and foremost, the proposed single family home fails to comply with the zoning regulations outlined in the Prince George's county zoning ordinance. Specifically, section 24 442 B, table one, or I, rather than rather the proposed variance, requests consideration under a previous zoning ordinance with no explanation as to why this property should not be subject to current regulations. The current ordinance sets forth clear guidelines and standards for setbacks lot coverage, building height and other important factors that are essential for maintaining the integrity and character of the neighborhood. The proposed lot coverage does not align with the requirements outlined in the zoning ordinance, potentially encroaching upon the privacy and enjoyment of adjacent property owners. In fact, because the petitioner is asking for 4ft of rear yard depth, excuse me, the residents at 1121 Eastern Avenue would have their privacy significantly impacted and encroached upon. Additionally, with a total lot width of 40ft and a house plantable width of 40 of 30ft, this will only allow for a maximum of 5ft of space from the property line shared with both 4709 man and 4713 man. This does not adhere to the current county codes which require a setback of 8ft from the side property lines. It does not appear that a variance has been requested for this discovery discrepancy. Although a variance has been requested for the total lot coverage, the neighborhood community feels that the proposed single family home is too large for the lot upon which it will sit. The size of the proposed dwelling will have a significant impact upon the privacy, use and enjoyment of the current property owners. Along with these concerns, the community also has a variety of concerns regarding drainage, parking, pests and the current presence of a number of unfinished developments in the local area. Prince George's county general variance decision standards indicate that a variance to zoning ordinance may only be granted when the board of appeals finds that one, a specific parcel of land is physically unique and unusual in a manner different from the nature of the surrounding properties with respect to exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape, exceptional topographical conditions, or other extraordinary conditions peculiar to the specific parcel, such as the historical significance or environmentally sensitive features. Two, the particular uniqueness and I'm going to struggle with this word sorry, peculiarity of the specific property causes a zoning provision to impact disproportionately upon that property such that strict application of the provision will result in peculiar and unusual practical difficulties to the owner of the property. Three, such variance is the minimum reasonably necessary to overcome the exceptional physical conditions. Four, such variants can be granted without substantial impairment to the intent, purpose and integrity of the general plan or any functional master plan area master plan sector plan affecting the subject property. Five, such variants will not substantially impair the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties and six, a variance may not be granted if the practical difficulty is self inflicted by the owner of the property. As owners of the neighboring property, we dispute that one, the parcel under consideration is physically unique and unusual. Two, the zoning provisions disproportionately impacts the parcel under consideration three, the variance requested is the minimum reasonable reasonably necessary to overcome the exceptional physical conditions. Four, the variance can be granted without substantial impairment to the plans affecting the parcel under consideration, and five, the variance requested can be granted without substantial impairment of the use and enjoyment of the adjacent properties. In light of these concerns, we urge you to carefully reconsider the approval of the zoning building permit for the proposed single family home. It is imperative that any development in our community adheres to the established and current zoning regulation and considers the current use and enjoyment of adjacent properties. Thank you for taking the time to consider our objections to this project. We trust that you will give due diligence to this matter and make a decision that upholds the best interests of the community. Thank you. Miss Belling, this is Rodrigo Franco. I agree with and support with the letter that Kate just read. I'm going to see if I can get a motion so that if you all want to send individuals. Madam Chair, may I speak as the applicant in response to what was said? Yes. Okay. Well, this is Ziad Chalabi. We've heard a lot of stuff, a lot of, you know, claims that I just want to make, set the record straight.

Thank you for taking the time to consider our objections to this project. We trust that you will give due diligence to this matter and make a decision that upholds the best interests of the community. Thank you. Miss Belling, this is Rodrigo Franco. I agree with and support with the letter that Kate just read. I'm going to see if I can get a motion so that if you all want to send individuals. Madam Chair, may I speak as the applicant in response to what was said? Yes. Okay. Well, this is Ziad Chalabi. We've heard a lot of stuff, a lot of, you know, claims that I just want to make, set the record straight. First of all, with respect to the homeowner association, when we requested the official records, there is nothing about the Homer association. Otherwise, I would have asked for meeting to inform the neighbors of what's being proposed. As to the shape and size of the lot. As you can see on this picture, the one below, the general map below that shows not the photograph, but the one below it, it shows the block. And it shows, if. I don't know if you can zoom on a little bit on it, but I'm going to make an example. I'm going to just point out the neighbors to the right and to the left, the lots. As you can see, and as a result of the shape of this rectangular block, the houses are on two lots just like this slide, identical to this lot. The neighbor to the left misses Kipling. I believe she has also, and I'm going to just. And it's stated in there, but I'm going to mention it. She has the same square footage in terms of lot area as this lot. Exactly the same. And the house that's on the lot is bigger than what's being proposed. As to the neighbor to the left, to the right, the square footage is 3692, which is smaller than the size of this lot, and the house is even bigger than what's being proposed. I have mentioned, and I'm just pointing out just these two but I actually showed in the. I have areas and arrows to each lot showing the similarity of what's, you know, what's being proposed in relation to this lot. There are no trees being to be removed as a result of this proposed new construction. Single family house not to be taken. The 4ft in the rear. It's not along the entire rear. The setback, the 4ft variance, the only reason we're asking, it's only a small portion because of the shape of the lot. And that takes us back again to the shape of the lot. It's only a small area but the majority of the rear yard will be met, which is 20ft. The lot as proposed or the house as proposed meet the setback from the street for the zoning meets the setback from the side, both sides and about 60% to 70% meets the rear yard setback. With respect, and I'll conclude with this, with respect to the drainage. The drainage. This is a small lot. We're talking about a 4000 square foot lot, a little under. So with the proposed house, the drainage, the natural drainage, as mentioned, it goes, you know, it drains down towards eastern Avenue, which is a very developed area. There are no streams nearby. There are no wooded areas. It's a. It's a completely. It's an urban area and everybody is aware of it. It's right next to DC line. The. The. Any drainage going from this house will be directed towards the front, along the front and portion of it towards the rear. I am willing, if they have an issue, if a neighbor over there has an issue, for example, because of their yard that's flooded. Not, not. I haven't done anything. I'm not the cause of any of it. But if they have an issue with the grading or something, more than happy to help them grade it and help them drain it away. Flooding, basement flooding, not necessarily from a neighboring yard, sometimes just bad grading or around the existing house that causes this water to, you know, flood the basements. I'll be more than happy to have, you know, madam chair, if there's any question about this, be more than happy to answer. But certainly the intention is not to build and put anything that will upset the neighbors. But I can't help if they, you know, by proposing a house, everybody is objecting to it. I'm actually surprised that they are. We're trying to. And this is one last thing about the square footage of the house. The house, I did not put it in the map, but if you go into the records, majority of the houses in the neighborhood, larger or the same as what we're proposing. What I am proposing here. And thank you for listening. Madam, can I speak? This is Javier. You have more to add, Mister Javier? Yes, ma'am. Okay, so there are streams here in the area. He may not realize that the streams are underneath the streets on Eastern Avenue, that it's called the Watts branch that flows into the Anacostia river. Had he consulted with the neighbors in the first place, he would have known that the community association, not a homeowner association, exists. I am part of the founding members of that community association, Mister Sazid. Second, you yourself had just admitted that that lot is tiny, I think. No way. Comparison with that lot and the other houses on both sides. Madam chair, this is Courtney Fisher. The petitioner has misrepresented the size of the houses around that lot. Okay, I just want to be clear about that. He, I believe, was sworn in, but he has misrepresented the size of both of the houses around the lot, as well as the house across the street. So just to be clear about. All right, the misrepresentations. Thank you very much. This is Roberto Franco, and I just wanted to reiterate what she just said. I think you mentioned, like, my house was 3600 sqft. That's the square foot of all the levels of the house. Our concern is with the footprints of the house versus ours. If you look at the plan, it's clearly a larger footprint than our house. We'll follow up on that. Madam chair, just to. This is Ziach lobby. The area that I quoted is the lot area. I did not quote any house area. I quoted the lot area. Just so the record is straight.

No, I must not. Miss Scudder, did you have anything else you wanted to add? I guess I would just. In, you know, closing, I would just say, you know, that some of the issues that we've heard raised by the neighbors, you know, such as construction dragging out for ten years, in some instances in their neighborhood, you know, those are code enforcement issues that should be reported to the Department of permitted inspections and enforcement, or DPI. Those are not issues that this board has jurisdiction over. And, you know, the trees, you know, that Ziad just clarified there's no trees that are going to be removed for this particular proposal. But even if they. There were, that's not really an issue that this board has jurisdiction over either. I'd also just like to address a comment that was made by Mister Muley earlier that the applicant filed last minute under the prior zoning ordinance. I just like to make the point that hundreds of property owners filed various kinds of applications prior to the April 1, 2024 deadline. And with that being said, you know, I would point out that the county council approved recently two resolutions that extended the use of the prior zoning ordinance for another two years. And then Miss Celeste, I think she mentioned concerns about this proposal. The house encroaching on their property. There is no encroachment. As Mister Shalabi pointed out, the house will be meeting the side yard setback requirements. We're not requesting a variance with regard to side yard or front yard. Okay. All right. Thank you. Yes. So I'd like to take them, make a motion that we take this under advisement. Wait a minute. We said we were going to leave the record open for any of the neighbors that wanted to submit an individual letter. Revised motion, madam chair. Again, revised motion. Before we revise the motion, may I ask a question? This is board member Austin. Yeah, we need a second on the motion and then discussion. Okay, Watson? I had seconded the original motion. The original motion to take it under advisement. So are you rescinding your second mister Isa for the original motion since there's a motion. Table? Yes. Yes. Okay, so, Miss Austin, you had comments? Yes. This board member Austin. Thank you, chair. Lady Mac, I thought that because the letter was read into the record and it represented the concerns of the homeowners, all of them, who had originally signed what they were calling a petition. I thought that we were clear on all the comments from the neighbors. I don't think she's the president of the organization, and we were saying we would open. Keep the record open for anyone who wanted to submit an individual letter for the organization. Okay, chairman, should we hold the record open for those letters, at least to the next hearing date? If we can get through our other issues. Okay, we have a motion. Second, Gordon Reisler, to hold the record open. Yes, mister. Let's give it a date. We need those letters in here. By when, miss? We need them in by the 20th of this month. Miss Stone, is there any way that you could send me a copy of the petition that they submitted? Because we never had an opportunity to review that prior to the hearing this evening. I don't think it made it into the binder because it was viewed as a petition, which is what the residents were calling it all along, until they. They were told that petitions weren't allowed. Right. Miss Garner, is. Is that a possibility? Can I forward that on. It's part of it is. It's part of the record, correct? I don't know. It made it into the binder. The binder is the actual record. It did. It's the very last exhibit. It's. Okay, so it is in the record. So it is in the record. It is in the record. Miss Stone. It wasn't in the binder that I received from staff, but I do. I did note that it was in, you know, the binder that you all have been sharing on the screen. I saw it from the shared screen, but it wasn't in the binder that we were emailed before the hearing. Okay, Miss Garner, should I make it part of the record being in the binder? And can I share with Miss Gutter? Miss Garner? I would object to the petition being allowed into the record, because it is. You know, even the residents refer to it as a petition. I just wanted to get a copy of it since the. One of the neighbors read it into the record. Miss Garden? I don't know. I'm talking on turn here. But if additional letters that are provided by the community association or other homeowners are added to the record, can those be provided to Miss Scudder? I believe they should be, because. Yes. You know, all the parties should have the opportunity to be able to review and respond properly. They will be exhibits once they're submitted. So when they get in on the 20th, we forward those to miss copies to Miss Scudder? Yes, correct that. Okay, Miss Gutter? Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

I can't see Miss Belling. She read, basically, that was her testimony, which read. So the letter itself is not part of the binder and it's not an exhibit. So it's not part of the binder. And so any subsequent letters that are submitted and become exhibits will be considered part of the binder and can be shared. Yes. Okay. So, Miss Celeste, please remove the quote unquote petition from the binder, but then include any letters that are submitted. Sure. Hi, excuse me. This is Celeste Franco. I just wanted to be very clear because it felt a little bit like our intentions with calling it a letter versus petition or whatnot, were being called into question. We did not know. We were not advised that petitions, letters, whatever, were not allowable. So we werent doing anything nefarious or trying to get around any rules or anything like that. It felt a little bit like our being called into question, so I just wanted to make. No, no. It is just that we can accept letters, but a petition is. Is different from a letter. Okay. A petition does have a preface to it, but a letter is only a letter, not with all of the homeowners signatures. But like I said, the letter was read for the record. The letters that we will be submitting will become exhibits and part of the record. Anybody have problem with that? But I think I left something out. We may need some technical assistance. I have to make a motion to open up again. I thought we were going to hold it open. Yeah, I thought that was the motion. We held it open for the letters, but yeah, we also technical assistance. Have we taken a vote on that? No, I think we closed the records. Not yet. We haven't voted. Okay. Okay. So I think we can just substitute the motion, make it hold it open for additional letters as well as technical assistance. Yes, that's appropriate. It's a amended motion. It's amendment to the motion. Amendment to the motion. Amendment to the motion. Excuse me. This is Kate Belling. I just would like clarification as to what you mean by technical assistance. Could you please clarify that? I can ask questions of anyone that I want to get some answers from. Okay, thank you. Mm hmm. Okay, so we have. Do we need a motion for that or not? The motion? Second. Okay, did you get a second or. I need to do it, I think. Who made the motion? The amended motion. Mac. Chair. Mac. And Mister vice chair Isler. Second the motion. Thank you. Madam chair. Aye. Mister Eisler? Aye. Miss Alston? Aye. Miss Hill? Michelle. She looks like she may be frozen. Okay. Motion carries 30. I do apologize for that oversight. Yours. Okay. Thank you all for participating. And I don't know when we were going to bring this up as a discussion item. Well, I wouldn't. I would wait until after the 20th of the 20th, and the next hearing is the 22nd, so I can put it on as a discussion case if we have all of our questions answered. Well, it's. It's open for technical assistance, so any questions can be done prior to the next hearing. Okay, thank you. Thank everybody for participating. Thank you, Miss Gutter and crew. Thank you.

Affirm under the penalties of perjury that the responses given and statements made will be the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Yes. Okay. I take it Miss Gutter is going to start out telling us what's proposed. Yes. Under v 2424 for 1306 Opus Street. I want to first clarify the applicant's request. We are using the zoning ordinance and the only variance we are requesting is a variance with regard to net lot area. So we're requesting 1000 sqft with regard to net lot area. I see on your agenda that there are a number of other variances listed. And I think that may be because this was analyzed under the new zoning ordinance. But we submitted our application under the old or under the prior ordinance. So again, the only variance we are seeking is for the thousand square feet of net lot area. I'm sorry. No problem. Let me. So all we need is the 1000 sqft? Yes, that's correct. Let me verify on what we did with the hearing notice. This is v 2424. Bear with me 1 second. No neighbors on this one. We can invite the other neighbors. It looks like we did review it under the old code. So we have 442 b, table one prescribed set, each lot. We definitely know about the net lot area. Section 442 D prescribes that each lot should have a minimum of 65ft measured along the front building line. Barbara, this is the Atchelabi. Yes. Yeah, Barbara. And under the old zoning prior to 1928, frontage and street, you can go down to 40. You can go down to the five and five on both sides. And what else do we have? What's that? Cover lot coverage is 30%. We should be. We are. Okay. Okay, hold on. Yeah, no problem. Take your time. 3ft, left and right. You said five. It's. Yeah, we're providing five and five, madam chair. And that's the minimum requirement. Right. So the only thing you need is net lot area. That's. That's it. Okay. To the 5000. Because the 5000 is the minimum required. Right. I think just we skip some footnotes. Yep. It's not an addition, it's a new construction. I don't know if that makes a difference. Was there ever anything on the site, any building? No, no, it's a vacant law. Why is this saying building part of proposed two story addition? It's not an addition, it's a new construction. If it says anywhere in our application, it must be an error. But it's not. I don't think. And the statement of justification says the applicant is proposing to construct a two story house with a basement and a one car garage on lots 25 and 26. Yeah. The thing is, you just send a justification letter recently. After we send a notice of heating. Gotcha. We got the justification letter later. Yeah, actually, it's right here in the last. You know, it is the same. I guess we could also look at the application that we submitted. I'm looking at that right now. The application, I think, says construction of a new single family. Single family dwelling. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So. Oh, do we need to redo the hearing notice? I hope not. Well, we're asking for less, you know. Yeah. Than what we advertised. Building permit? The application. Oh, Miss Garner or Mister Watson. Do we need to re advertise this? I don't want to. Yes. The notice wasn't correct. It said a two story addition instead of a new single family dwelling, but it's. The new single family dwelling is a two story, so you just wipe out that word addition. I still think that if you're correcting the record, that it has to be sent out again. The corrected notice. I agree with Miss Gardner. The notice requirement. Sorry. Don't kill me.

Same theme, same lineup request for variances of 30ft lot with 20ft lot frontage and 3.8% lot coverage. To validate existing conditions, the lot width lot frontage and obtain a building permit to construct a proposed two story single family dwelling and ten by 28 foot driveway at 5408 Center Avenue in Lanham. Miss Scudder is back with us. Yes, I'll state for the record my name and address. Tracy Scudder, 4200 Parliament Place, week 220 Lana, Maryland 20706. Mister Shalabi. Zia Chalabi, 9470 Annapolis Road, Suite 414 in Lana, Maryland 20706. Anyone else here with you all? And Terry Myers, legal assistant to Tracy Scudder, 4200 parliament Place. Lana, Maryland. Okay, could I get the two of you to raise your right hand so that we can swear your testimony in? Do you sound the square? Affirm under the penalties of perjury that the rest of responses given and statements made will be the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Yes. You had your statement in here, Miss Scudder. Yes, I sure do. The statement of justification is in the record. It's in the binder. This case. It also relates to a proposed infill development project. The request for variances are being made under the current zoning ordinance. This lot 15 is in the Lincoln subdivision. The Lincoln subdivision has existed since 1908. This property is as I mentioned, the proposal is to construct a two story house with a one car garage on lot 15. The subject property is 5400. It's located in the 2010 Glendale, Seabrook, Lanham and vicinity approved sector plan and sectional map amendment. The property is zoned rr. My statement of justification goes through the specifics of, you know, the requirements and what's required, what's proposed. So you'll see that and colorful charts throughout the statement of justification, which I hope will be helpful to the board. But I would mention that pursuant to under the new zoning ordinance, and pursuant to 27 7403 a, which pertains to the development of nonconforming lots in residential zones, it says that nonconforming lot. Whether or not compliance with the missile standards is possible, one single family unit is allowed. The applicant did get a site development concept plan approved by DPI under permit number 405-54-2022 the county subsequently determined that there were variances that were necessary. So that is why we have come before the board this evening, is to request the variances that the county has said we need to apply for before we can proceed with the construction of this single family dwelling. Let's see. I've included the permit information permit comments so that you all will have all of that. But by way of background, Mister Shalabi, he purchased this lot as well in 2023, with the intent of building a two story dwelling with a one car garage. The requested variances are the minimum necessary to afford relief. Just to kind of get into some of the criteria of approval, which I of course lay out in the statement of justification, this particular property is a corner lot in an older subdivision. Like I said that was created in 1908, thus preceding the subdivision regulations and zoning regulations that exist today, including minimum lot width and lot from frontage width at Front street line and maximum lot coverage requirements. As you can see from the application, the property is exceptionally narrow and small in size. And this block that this property is on, it has an alley behind the houses on the block. And what makes this particular lot unique is that the alley makes a sharp 90 degree turn at the subject lot's location. And it sort of. That turn, it kind of cuts into the lot to effectuate that turn. And as a result, the lot has a peculiar shape, unlike all the other lots on the block. So we've enclosed a general map of the properties in the area so that you can see that, you know, that illustration of the alley's 90 degree turn right at that lot and the odd shape of the lot that's. That sort of results from its location. So it's not feasible, you know, to meet the minimum requirements of 70ft lot frontage at Front street line and the maximum lot coverage of 25% in particular. So of course, my statement of justification does go on to address all the other criteria. I'll note that again, the various plans. I think this application is in harmony with the various plans and their goals and policies. So there's a section in the statement of justification on page six where I address the goals and policies of the various plans and demonstrate that this application is in harmony with those. And so with that being said, I will conclude my presentation and I'll turn it over to Ziad to see if Ziad wants to add anything. Ziad? Yes, madam chair, I would. If the board members or the chair has any questions, specific questions, I'll be more than happy to answer. I don't have anything else to add to Miss Cutter, but be happy to answer any questions you may. The board may have. Thank you.

And as I stated before, I live directly adjacent to the non conforming lot at 5408 Center Avenue in Lincoln Covenant community. Lincoln is a historical community that is one of the oldest african american communities in Prince George's county.

I stand united with our neighbors against approval of the variances requested in appeal number v 29 24. The very idea that three different variances, that is a lot, width of 30ft, lot footage 20ft and maximum lot coverage 3.8% are required for a lot. This size indicates the sheer lack of size necessary and required by the county on which to construct a house. I do want to correct a statement that was made that this property in question lies on a corner. My property lies on the corner. The lot in question is between my lot and another lot. It is not a corner lot. It is honestly not the right property for the structure desired. The owner who purchased this property in January of this year clearly bought it with the intent to build on it and could have had the opportunity to check the lot sizes and requirements before purchasing. But he did not. And at this point, approving these variances will affect the overall landscape of our community. My husband and I have spent a lifetime building a legacy for our family. Approval of these variances will have a negative effect on our quality of life and will potentially have a negative effect on the equity and property values we have built over the last 38 years. It is my understanding that in order for the variances to be approved, there are six requirements, all of which must be met before it is approved. Clearly, requirement number five, such variants will not substantially impair the use and employment. Enjoyment of adjacent property is an issue here. It definitely would impair number six. A variance may not be granted if the practical difficulty is self inflicted by the owner of the property. The owner of the property self inflicted. This need for a variance in buying a lot, a non conforming lot that he had the intent to build on immediately without checking the proper requirements. I stand in united with my neighbors, and I ask, I urge you, to deny the variances that are requested and help us continue to embrace growth while honoring the legacy and heritage of our historical. Historical community called Lincoln. Thank you so much for this opportunity. You're welcome. Let me ask you a question. How would this impair your enjoyment? Because the lot would be so close to our property that in spending time out on the side of our house, we would be basically looking at them, rather than the green space that we're accustomed to looking at. Now, you said you want to enhance growth. Yes. We embrace growth in our community, and that is how we became such a diverse community, which we are very proud of. So embracing growth would mean not having any further growth in the neighborhood? No, no, no. We embraced the growth in the neighborhood, but we want it done in accordance with the rules and regulations and zoning ordinances that are in effect. Not that someone would come in and knowingly know them and try to get the variances approved, knowing that when he bought it, he needed more property to build on. Okay, thank you. This is Cesar. Hey. May I also speak to the opportunity? Okay. I'm sorry. I think you all had some orders. They gave an order when you first came on, Miss Barrett. Well, I'll go on with Kim Jackson. Hello. Good evening. Yeah, good evening, everyone. My name is Kimberly Jackson, and I live at 99. 54 Park street. And my property is backs up to the property of Miss Barrett and the property that's in question. And the way my lot is set up, I am below that lot. And right now, the current lot is full of trees and growth. If that vegetation was to be cut down, all of the water would be coming down into my yard. I already have some issues which I have addressed, but when it rains, it's like there's a. I've been in the middle of a lake, so to speak, sometimes because all of the rain that currently comes down my hill. And so my. That would be my first issue is just having all that greenery cut down, but also the fact that depending on how much backyard space they would have, I am very worried about people starting to move backwards into the alley that they talked about into my yard and start to mess up or deal with high grass and everything. Miss Olga, can we see the photos starting with six a. Miss Olga? Yes. I look at. Oh, okay. Madam chair, can I just ask a question and anybody can answer this? From the, from the subdivision plan, it looks like the alley is drivable. Is that true? Is it a drivable alley? It is not. It's not even an alley. I mean, it's full of vegetation or growth from the different yards. Madam chair, this is Ziad Shalabi. May I respond to the question? Yes, mister Shalabi. Yes. This alley is wooded. It will remain wooded. We don't touch it. We're not getting closer to it, so we're not going to be disturbing that vegetation within that area will remain. Don't believe him. Excuse me. Excuse me. We don't have outbursts like that. Okay. When you get an opportunity to speak, you can. Okay, go ahead. Mister Shalabi. Yes. With respect to that particular point, the, like I said, and I will emphasize that alleyway is undeveloped, so it's all fully wooded. We don't have the right to go into that.

Pamela Gray is here and I have a few points to add. I am on Highland Avenue, longtime member of Lincoln Vista. I do believe the current ordinance requires 20,000 build, not the 10,000. 10,000 sqft was the old variance or the old ordinance, which we all complied to. Every resident within this community has complied to the 10,000 sqft, with exception of this current build projection and a build that we had last year. If I may show my screen, I can share you a. Show you a picture of what the impact is submitted. Oh, did she freeze? I think she made proton. Okay, well, we're going to move on. Who has not spoken? Mister Hay? Yes, ma'am. Yes, I am concurring with the earlier residents who spoke. And there are quite a few things that this variance creates problems and issues with. Miss Jackson mentioned the removal of the foliage and the water, groundwater getting in the yard. Lincoln is historically a neighborhood built in folly branch. It's an older neighborhood. And in and around Folly branch, there is a great deal of high water. There's a great deal of water intrusion. There's a great deal of flooding that gets into the basements of our homes. More improvement. And we don't want to deny improvement. We just want improvement to conform with what we have done exist. What we have existing and we have done previously. We previously had a covenant in the neighborhood that was given by parking planning for a 10,000 square foot minimum that has not been maintained. We ask that. We're asking that as a neighborhood, not only the adjoining residents, but it creates more construction that doesn't conform, creates more problems with water, water intrusion. The problem that we have with the wetlands at Folly branch. And it creates a lot of flooding in basements in the neighborhood. Has this something been existing for a long time? Yes, ma'am. Have you ever contacted county about it? The county is where? Well, we have had problems. I'm just asking the question, ma'am. I'm just asking the question. Is it yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Or has it been a while or what this flooding has gone on? I mean, I've been a resident and neighborhood. I was born here, I grew up here. I built a home here. So I'm well aware of all of the problems. And I was a part of the Pacific association when the covenant was established for the preservation of the rural residential impact we like to have on the community. The water problems are created by more construction. The water problems are created because there are not a lot of gutters, storm drains within the neighborhood where storm drains could be built, they have been built. Some of the residents themselves constructed storm drains back in the back in the earlier part of the later part of the 20th century. So what I'm saying is more construction, any construction impacts the neighborhood. But construction that does not conform houses and greatly impacts the neighborhood because the lot coverage on this particular property at 5000 sqft is 25% of the lot requirement. When was the last time you all had a new build in the neighborhood? A new building? Is that what you're saying, ma'am? Yes. There is a building built on Grant street that doesn't conform. I mean, I say when was the last time? I'm saying when you. Year. Within the past year. Oh, okay. Thank you. Uh huh. Okay. This is board member Isaac. Can I ask a question, chairman? Yes, please. So the 10,000 sqft or 20,000 square footage required to build, is that a covenant or. I heard reference to it. I was just trying to understand. Okay. This Caesar hay. 20,000 sqft is the rural residential zone. A 10,000 sqft was a lot minimum that was granted in the covenant. Okay, so 10,000 sqft, most, most. All of the residents who built under that covenant had to have a minimum of 10,000 sqft. Most of the residents, a lot of the residents in the neighborhood built their own homes and were subject to that 10,000 square foot covenant. So therefore. And that's this particular lot is probably the smallest lot in the neighborhood because most of the lots in the neighborhood are 7500. Think if you put two lots together, you get 1500 square feet. Excuse me. I'm sorry. When you say covenant, I think you're meeting zoning ordinance. When you say covenant, that. That leads me to believe that it was an hoa. Covenant or my mind just went blank. No, we're not an hoa, but an hoa cannot determine that lot area. Only the code can do that. This", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Shalabi's Construction", "insights": [{"observation": "The alley is wooded.

No, we're not an hoa, but an hoa cannot determine that lot area. Only the code can do that. This is Caesar Haigh. The code, the zoning code is rural residential. We were granted a covenant by park and planning. Park and planning cannot grant a covenant. Parking planning granted us a special exception, if you want to call it, or whatever. They gave us a special exception and we had a document in our citizens association. Okay, do you have that special exception? We know that when, when. When the. When it was Pat, when leadership was passed on, the covenant was lost. Leadership in the civic association passed on for whatever reason, the covenant can't be found. But, but we can give testimony of multiple residents who, who built under the covenant that we had. And it was with parking planet. I just like to get to the point of why you're against it. Could you give me two reasons why you're against it? One was lot size. What's the other? I have issue. I'm not adjacent property owner, but I have issue with the construction that doesn't conform because more construction that doesn't conform leads to a downward trend in the water table, the quality of the existing homes in the neighborhood. Miss Jackson mentioned about the fact that that dwelling or the construction of that dwelling will possibly cause water intrusion and flooding in her yard. And I'm aware of that, and many of the residents here are aware of that. Lincoln is an older community. It's not a new development where you can go control all of the construction on the property in the neighborhood. So what happens is you have flat lands. You have areas where there are flat lands where water puddles. It just puddles. And then you have areas where you have great slopes. So it wasn't developed for infill. It really wasn't developed for infill. It was developed at the time for a different composition of home. That's my objection. It'll cause. I object to it because it will cause a problem of livability with the other existing homes and residents in the neighborhood. Man, I understand your concerns. Thank you very much. Is there anyone we missed? Madam chair, this is Ziad Shalabi. May I respond quickly to the two points mentioned? Yes, yes. Okay. Mister Gray, I think the. My name is Hay, sir. Hey, mister Hay. H a y. I apologize, mister Hay. My wife approached you the other day and you ignored her. But that's okay. Go ahead. Yeah, we're very respectful here. Okay. Yes, ma'am. I'm just. Just telling you. I understand that, but you do that when you catch them out there again. But we're respectful here. Well, I'm not aware of that encounter, but anyway, I just responding to these two points with respect to the area, we are not asking for any relief on the issue area. The new zoning ordinance allows for sizes for the lot that we have. It does not specify 20,000 or 10,000 under the non conforming use. So that's number one. We had approvals from park and planning, and because of the change in the interpretation of that, they asked us to go back and get a variance on the lots on the building, front building line and street building line. With respect to the drainage, this lot. I mean, I understand what Mister Hay was talking about. In some portions of the Lincoln subdivisions, yes. There are areas that are flat and have drainage issues. This particular section has slopes and drainage is non issue. With respect to the downstream neighbor that is below us, we are separated by that neighbor via street, Park Avenue, I believe, and the alleyway. Any drainage goes into those areas away from her house, it does not create any problem for her. And we will make sure that doesn't create a problem for anybody. Not just her. As a result of this development. We're not going in there to create a problem for anybody else. We definitely will not cause that. But the topography in that location would easily drain the water away from the house. That's not. Well, I'm not gonna, you know, argue with you, but I will leave that determination for deep high because they will not issue. They will not issue us a permit if we cause problems to any downstream neighbors. Sir. Sir, this is Caesar. Hate. You said you're not looking for relief. Then why are you here? I was talking because they know that there are issues within this neighborhood. We are residents in this neighborhood. Mister Hay. Yes, ma'am. We're trying to get to some points, so. Okay. All right.

And I just wanted to go back on a few points we had discussed and I heard Mister Zaid, and I apologize if I pronounced your name wrong with respect to the square footage that's required to build in our neighborhood. And I'm not exactly sure what reference you're going from, but everything that we have received from our legislators, from park and planning and from the county, there is a zoning ordinance for square footage to build within our neighborhood. The house that you are proposing to build drastically is lower in size of any, any of the 340 houses we have in our neighborhood. I will speak to the fact that there were multiple lots for you to choose from to build. And having sat on this hearing for 6 hours, it appears as though you have a recruitment for lots that don't meet neighborhood standards that you're building on. And to speak with. Mitch Barrett had spoken and Miss Matthew had asked her about the expansion and beautification of our neighborhood. We are a historic neighborhood. We did not grow in size. We started out with ten houses. We have grown to over 320 some houses. And we are continuing to grow. We have developers that are coming in here that are appropriately building and they're building the appropriate infrastructure when they come in here. We are a beautiful historic neighborhood with fantastic wildlife such that Maryland National Capital park and Planning and Army Corps of Engineers continue to try to preserve the wildlife in here. The alleyway that was mentioned was considered by the county as a paper road, and it is there for the county to come in to complete the stormwater management that they should have completed some 40 years ago, waiting for funding and whatever. But we do have a stormwater management problem and tearing down trees and continuing to build on small spaces. You're asking to build on a lot under 6000, believe it's only close to 5000 sqft. That is a very small space of trees that you're going to clear away that is necessary for us to maintain water drainage within our community. If stormwater management was not a concern, Chesapeake Bay would not continue to give us money to build trees. So we are not trying to tear down trees that are adjacent to small lots next to one another where those trees, that vegetation is necessary to absorb the water that is produced on and in our neighborhood. We are built on a water table and we do know that. And that's why all of the infrastructure has been put in place and the vegetation remains so that we can control this water flow and enjoy the wildlife that we have here. We have a builder in our neighborhood now building several houses. There are umpteen lots that are available to build on. This particular lot should not be the lot that's given the exception. In fact, our legislator, Eric Olson, he argued and supported our neighborhood before the county on CB 1524. And on April 25, he got approval. He won his amendment to stop the building and stop realtors and investors from coming in to try to usurp any and every free green space within our community. The community needs to go back, the county needs to go back to the enforcements that they required all the other 320 plus houses to stick to a minimum of 10,000. Minimum. Most of us, 90% of us had to build on 20,000. Neighbors in this community have been here in excess of 30 plus years. I would say 25% have been there at least 90 years. You said Mister Olson put it CB 1524. This is board member Hill. So what is the lot size that he is proposing to build on? What's the lot size? I would defer to him, but I believe Miss Scrutter said something. Scudder. I apologize, Miss Tracy Scudder, I believe they mentioned something about 5000, 205,000, 305,000, 405,400 yes. The smallest house will ever have built in our community. For what reason you're doing that? When I got out the car and I. Hold on. Whoever's speaking. We've asked several times to give your name. Caesar hay. Mm hmm. I'd like to add, madam chairman, that if you view the composition. Just to add the composition of how the house that's being built and the two homes that's being built in between, it doesn't conform. It just. It doesn't conform. If you could view the pictures of the homes that are already there. Get that up, miss, over. Can we get that? It starts with the photos overhead. This is great. Speaking again. In addition to that, the driveway that we believe is proposed is not. Mister Zaid, do you plan to live in this home? Mister Shaw? My daughter is. Your daughter does. How many cars, how many vehicles does she plan to park at this residence? Two. So is the driveway being built going to suffice for two cars? Yes, there's a. We currently have a problem with people moving into the neighborhood saying they have one or two small vehicles and end up parking on the street, which I know this board is not responsible for that, but that is another concern for us as citizens here. Building, that is. Ma'am. Chairman. I'm sorry, Ellis Watson. All comments should be addressed to the chair and not the petitioner.

Building, that is. Ma'am. Chairman. I'm sorry, Ellis Watson. All comments should be addressed to the chair and not the petitioner. So please direct all the comments to the madam chair. Matt, please. This is Pamela Gray. I stand corrected. Thank you. Okay. Was there anything else? Somebody else had a question. We have the pictures. This is board member Young. As you all are pulling up the pictures, I just wanted to respond to some comments that Miss Gray just made. She mentioned CB 15. That bill has not passed. That is, the omnibus corrective bill is currently pending. It's a draft bill. It has not passed the county council, so it is not current law. This is Pamela Gray speaking. Miss Scudder, Eric Olson was at our civic association meeting on April 18, and he did communicate to us that the bill passed. In addition, our vice president and our security chief was at that meeting, along with Miss Jacqueline Bates, who had to drop off because of timing, and another community member, who is serving as an election judge, had to drop off. Miss Barrett was also at that meeting. And she's got her hand waved. She's trying to say something. Follow up with that. That's easily verifiable. Yes, absolutely. Okay. Miss Barrett has a question. Is Olga available? Yes, I'm here. We needed to see photos. Okay. You're not seeing anything? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is Pamela Gray. Could we acknowledge Miss Tony Barrett? She has been waiting to speak for some time before. Before we do that, madam Chair, Miss Olga, I believe we need to see the aerials. Yes, subdivision. Okay. We haven't talked with you, Miss Barrett. Madam chair, Miss Barrett gave a statement at the beginning. History of the community. I had my hand raised because I think Daniel Francois is on the line and he wants to speak also. He owns the property directly on the other side of this lot. I don't have his name as being sworn in. Was he here when I was asking who's here? I don't believe so. He was not sworn in. He may have gone away from the. The phone or something for a break because we've been on. On the line since six clock. But he is with you. Don't register. Well, he. We have to. Excuse me. This is board member Austin. Listen, all of us. I want to say all of us have been on the line since before 06:00. This is a process we all work through and we try to do it as expeditiously as we can. But I believe each and every one of you have told us how long you've been on the line. It's a process and we're trying to work through it. We appreciate your patience. Thank you. And we try to give everybody ample time to say something. But Mister Francois was not here when we were swearing in. If he chooses to say something once we finish with this, he can do that. Okay. This is Pamela Gray again, from the civic association. We are not upset about the time. Somebody has to be last. We do understand that. I'm sorry. We're not talking over one another, right? We're not talking. This is board member Austin. You are not last. We have another case after yours. Thank you. We have several cases after yours. Not a problem. I didn't want to talk over anyone. I just wanted to say that us mentioning that time was not being disrespectful to the board. It was just acknowledging that if we're stuttering or some of our members may have dropped off, it's because we have. And as you can see, our age, we have had to leave for work. We have election judges on board. So it's not just a handful that are here. We're trying to read our texts and go back and forth to make sure all of our questions are responded to. That was my concern. I understand. Okay. Thank you. You put your comment. Did you have something else to say? No, I defer. This is Miss Pamela Gray. Again. I defer. Back to Tony Barrett, who was trying to submit her comment before she was interrupted. No, I'm fine. Thank you for. This is Tony Barrett. I just wanted to be sure that Francois. Mister Francois had an opportunity to speak because he is directly affected by the lot. His lot is directly adjacent to the lighting. Question. Is Mister Francois on the phone now? He has to be here, and we have to swear him in for him to speak. But if he's here, we'll be happy to hear him. He might be having technical difficulties because he sent me several texts asking if we could hear him so he could have some technical problems. But thank you so much for considering that. Oh, yes. Okay. Now, we see a photo here that's outlined in blue is where the allot is, and we're talking about going around the curb. Somebody said it wasn't a curb there. No, he's not. This is Cesar Hay. I think there was. I think the. The attorney mentioned it was a corner lot, but it's not a corner lot. Okay, now we can see. So let me just clarify what I said earlier, because, you know, I guess what I was trying to say is that it's on the. It's on the corner of the alley. You know, it's located right where the alley starts making that turn. Miss Gutter, could you state your name before you speak, please? I'm sorry, Miss Stone? Yes. Tracy Scudder.

He's not muted. I'm not sure what the problem is. Okay. I don't know how much longer we can give. Okay, sorry. And do we have the blueprints for the house? This is board member Hill. Do we have the blueprints for the house? Yes. Can I see that? The elevations? Yes, sir. Mm hmm. Miss Olga? Yes. Hold on, please. Okay. I know it takes a minute. There it is. Let me unlatch. This is board member Island. Miss Barrett, if I'm facing the proposed lot from Senator street, are you the house to the right or the left of the proposed lot? The house on the corner to the right. Thank you. You had a question, miss, um. Hill. She's in, as I'm looking at it. I'm just trying to. I'm hearing everybody talk about the lot coverage and the lot size. I just wanted to see what. And then she said it was the smallest house that would be built there. I see. However, if you look at the, you know, the maps that are in the. In the binder, like the one that's below. Speaking. Miss Scudder. Tracy Scudder speaking. I was just commenting that if you look at aerials of the entire neighborhood, you will see that there are various size lots and houses throughout the neighborhood. They're not all conforming with one another in terms of size and lot size. There are various size lots throughout the neighborhood and various sized homes. This is Pamela gray speaking. I'm sorry to the board. Miss Scudder's statement was absolutely correct. There are various size houses throughout our neighborhood. But aside from the house that was built last year, they are all on a minimum of 10,000 sqft. Most of them are on 20,000 sqft. Okay. May I add to that, chairman? Madam chairman. Who's speaking? Caesar Hay. May I add to that? Yes. It's an old neighborhood, so therefore, you have older homes which were built on single lots. Historically, as the neighborhood came into the modern era, dual lots or ten, 10,000 sqft became the priority to enhance the neighborhood and not detract from the neighborhood. 10,000 sqft in a rural residential is a minimum. Because 20,000 sqft is a maximum. The builders who are building now, we are not averse to growth. The builders who are building now are building on the lot, minimum 10,000 sqft. This particular property, at 54 or 5200 sqft, or whatever it is, is grossly inferior to the other lots. It is the smallest lot in the neighborhood, and it was probably kept that way to preserve the lot coverage. And earlier, and it was for sale. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Earlier, and I certainly took note of it. Thank you. I could just 1 second, Miss Cutter. This is board member Hill. That lot, he was able to purchase that lot, correct? Yes. He was able to purchase it, yes. Okay. This Caesar. Hey. Yes. He was able to purchase it. Okay. He was able to purchase it. And if I'm. If I am accurate, he was able to purchase it as a yard sale price because of the fact that it doesn't conform. If you were to purchase lots within the neighborhood that did conform, you wouldn't pay 10,000 or $20,000 for it. You would pay a great amount of money, much more than that, to the point where when it was purchased, it wasn't. If he had knowledge of the neighborhood, which he seems to have knowledge of quite a few neighborhoods, he would have been aware that it was well below the residential minimum. And if he was concerned about the neighborhood, as he seems to, if he is, let me say, if he's concerned about the neighborhood, he would be aware of the problems that we've had in the neighborhood, and what the composition and what he's proposing to do would affect the neighborhood.

The area is not an issue. The county in the current zoning does not require, for under that section, does not require any, a minimum of 10,000 or 5000. It does not. They are trying to change it. Okay, fine. If I can jump in, Mister Shalabi. Cause I just wanna piggyback on what you're saying. Point out to the board that on page, I think it's 38 of the binder that was sent out. In the statement of justification. In my statement of justification on page three, I addressed the requirements with regard to, you know, this. We're coming under the current zoning ordinance. And as I mentioned earlier, pursuant to section 27 7403 a, which addresses the development of non conforming lots in residential zones, which is what we have here. It states that a non conforming lot, whether or not compliance with the dimensional standards is possible, a one single family unit is allowed, and a net lot area variance is not needed. Also, I have submitted into the record the comments from Parkin planning with regard to the site development concept plan that they approved under permit number 4055 420 22. You can see that staff is saying that the applicant needs to obtain variances from the board of appeals, except for lot size. So with regard to lot size, this property is not in need of a variance. Well, thank you for your comments, Miss Scudder. So, what we're going to do, I'd like to make a motion that we take this under. Madam chair, is Pamela Grace speaking? Miss Barrett has her hand raised again. May she be acknowledged before the board? Yes. You're muted. Hello? Is she there? Miss Barrett, you are muted. Thank you so much. I'm so sorry. I guess I'm a little tired, huh? Like everybody else? Yes. Am I correct that in order for the variance to be approved, that all six of the requirements must be met? That's what the law says. That's what the law says very clearly. This is a self inflicted. You brought that up before. Yes, I did, but I wanted to make sure that everybody understood that it is. He bought the lot. Our meetings are taped. We know exactly what you said earlier, so it is on the record. Okay. Thank you. I won't repeat it again, then, but I will do want to say that the lot down the street from me on Center Avenue for $100,000. Surely, if the owner of this property had bought two lots, he would have had to pay very close to that. In fact, we have two lots that are on in this we're putting up. We're only here. We're only here on this lot. Okay. Okay. Sure. Now, I do thank you for your input, madam chair, Pamela Gray speaking. I'm not quite clear what the distinction was being made by Miss Scudder and misses a. With respect to. To only talking about the front and not talking about lot space, could someone clear that up for us? Yes. 27 7403 does not require net lot area for a single family dwelling. Period. Okay. Net lot area is not in question for this piece of property at all. Pamela Gray speaking. Miss Stone, I'm sorry. The board. Was that reference coming from the requirements for a non conforming lot? Yes, the numbers. Thank you. In response to that, if I could state, going back to the change in the variance in the zoning, it is very clear that this particular parcel was up for sale. And that is why our legislator, Eric Olson, once our neighborhood became aware of what was going on and we made our petition to the permit board and to other county officials to stop the process for this one until we were heard. Because this was something that did happen without our knowledge up until this point. That is why our legislator from the county supported our community and bought this concern before the county legislative board under CB 1524. And I understand we're not going to rehash old discussion, but this will be confirmed. I just looked at the video myself. So the video is there for the approval. And that is why the county agreed to pull back on the ability for someone to come into our historic neighborhood and construct a property like this. So it is. We're not being non neighborly and we're not being non supportive of the county initiative. As commented, there are plenty of lots within our neighborhood. It's just this one is. And the build on having homes that are built on one lot may be true. However, every homeowner owns two lots. So one lot may be green space, one lot may be just their backyard area or extended space. But every homeowner here in our community, with the exception of that one home, has a minimum of the 10,000 sqft. Maximum of 20,000. Will conclude my comments for tonight. We hear you.

So that's why I was saying since you have to come back anyway on June 5, do you want to reschedule for. Well, we're not rescheduled, but we can put it on discussion. Is that good with you all? Yes, it's fine. That's fine. I'm just looking at the calendar. That's our meeting night. Yes, I'm good. Board member Austin? Oh, yes, ma'am. I was just right for them. I know. To how many we had said we're moving to June 5. That's all. One discussion, one case. Okay. Okay. Thank you all for your participation. We will be having a discussion item on this on June 5. You're more than welcome to listen in. There's no more testimony except for technical assistance. Thank you so much, madam chair. May I ask when we come back on June 5, much like attorney Scudder has a binder and you have a binder, will the civic association receive a binder so that we can prepare our comments as well? If you provide the. Excuse me. The case reviewer is Celeste Barlow. Provide her with a copy of the address, either an email address or snail mail address. We can send you a copy of the binder, but I want to let you know that you will not need to come back. You can listen. If you go to county council website at bottom of the page, you'll see a live stream. We will not be taking any further testimony or exhibits, so you can listen into the discussion on the county council livestream. Thank you, Miss Stone. I appreciate that. Good night. And recall case. Good night. Good night, everyone. Thank you for hanging in there with us. Good night. Thank you. Thank you, misses. Thank you. Thank you, madam chair. Thank you, member of the board. Thank you, Miss Mac. You're welcome. Thank you. Okay, we have a recall case and she had kids. I hope she's not asleep. She rejoined Miss Vasquez. Do we see her? It's. Yes, we see. Okay. V 28 24. I thought it was 27 20, and I think it's 27. She tall? Yes, 27 24. Chattel and Gwy Bandari. This is a request for variances of 9680 sqft net lot area and 6.6% lot coverage to validate existing conditions in net lot area and obtain a building permit to construct a driveway extension at 5607 Savannah Drive in Brandywine. Miss Bandera, are you here? Miss Bandari? She's still here, but her camera is not on and she is muted. I wish we had a little bell we could ring for people. We can ask her to unmute. That's the only thing we can do. Then we have to discuss if we want to continue with these discussion items or do we want to take it to another day? I would probably reschedule. Schedule it. Yes, I think so. We had two kind of long cases tonight. Yes, just two. Participatory. You know, I have some comments, but I can't say them right now. We're on the live stream. Nah, I'm feeling like. What? Okay, can we get a motion on rescheduling Miss Bandari? Yes, she hung up. She's still there, but not getting. I'm not getting a response.

Absolutely. Especially when we have so many witnesses per case. Yes, it's just like the old days. We used to have 20 and 30 witnesses per case. Yep. But I don't think it's necessary. If you all saying the same thing. I try to cut them off, and then somebody will ask the person need to make. All right, let's try one more time for Miss Mandari. No, I think they said they're going to let her know today. She rescheduled. Hey, I'd like to make. I'd like to make a motion that we reschedule v. 27 24. And can we get a date so we can call her or contact her? I'll have to figure that out. Hmm. I'll have to figure that out. Okay. I made my motion. Second. Thank you. Madam chair? Aye. And Mister Eisler? Aye. Miss Alston? Aye. And Miss Till? Aye. Motion carries 40. Okay, do we want to just do the minutes? Yes. A motion to approve the minutes of April 24. Second. Oh, wait a minute. We have lots of discussion cases. I thought we said we were going to put those on another day. No, we can't. Okay, we're going to be in the exact same position. Okay, we have to have us a little gathering with Miss Garner to see how we can get through these. Well, I think we're just. Let me get my notes from last meeting. Yeah, I think we're just putting too many cases on each night expect. You know, and we've gotten into this habit of saying we want to hold open or whatever. I like to make my decision that night. No problem. Chair. Lady Mac, can I just share with you, I was ready to vote on at least two cases tonight. I was ready to vote on eight. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Barbara? We're still live streaming. Mister Watson. Sorry? Live streaming. I just. I just want to see if it's possible. Barbara, is our earlier start time for next meeting possible in order to do the discussion items for the night? That's what I was saying. Can we possibly advertise the meeting for 05:00? Well, we've already sent. Oh, wait, I'm sorry. Can always do a revision. Yes, of course. On the next agenda, I can say the meeting will start at five. How's that? And then that should give us ample opportunity and for the board to deliberate more on the cases so we can, you know, knock these on discussion out fairly quickly next time. So it's not good for us to make that decision on the same day. The only thing I worry about is live streaming. Yes. And having petitioners, usually when we just do the discussion, it's just. Yeah, yeah. This is kind of considered like a closed reading when you're deliberating, so it shouldn't be. It shouldn't be live stream. All right, well, you just do it. You want to live stream? You all want to run through. Yeah, I'm sorry, what did you say? Mister Watson, my apologies. We are still live streaming. Yes, we are. As part of meeting. I think we can run through them pretty fast. Fast. We know what the criteria is. I'm sorry, I mean, the merit. So there are certain, in terms of the open meeting act, there's certain things that don't have to be available to the public, and that's quite the judicial parts of the meeting where you're making determinations. We cannot meet as a group, as a group without it being advertised. So the only way we, I mean, we could go into maybe executive session. So I think that's what miss, I think that's what Miss Garner's trying to say is like, maybe we could push these back to next week and just start at five. But like I was saying, then you're going to have petitioners listening in, because if this, if this hearing is open, you're going to get petitioners logging in. I think she's saying we can make it a closed session. Is that right, mister? I may be missing. Well, we've invited people back to listen even though they can't have any input. So I'm going to ask Mister Watson, is that what you normally do? You all deliberate on the record? Like open text, we delivery on the record, because there's our criteria to close the meeting. And those criteria I don't believe we have met, you know, the training sessions for the chair, that council, and we have to have two members and we have to have, also we have to have somebody from communications on. So it's a process to close the meeting. Right. And plus that has to be advertised as well that we have a closed meeting. Right. I. So I don't know what your agenda. I mean, I mean, I would think that the agenda would have a closed session on there. So I don't know if that's. Have you ever, have you ever added a closed session to your agendas? Maybe going to executive session? I don't. Yeah, that's the same thing. Executive session, closed session, executive. But it's not a regular thing, though. We don't do that. Well, we don't.

That's this one. Woodbury street in Hyattsville. Not the one I have. Yes. Colvin? Huh? You turn the page. It's the last one on the previous page. V 90 23. Van Dorn. Yes? I'm on the wrong page. Oh, no. You want to take it over, mister? I have 95. 30. That's 95. That's the next case. That's the next case. Okay. There was one more left at the bottom of the previous page. That was Miss Banduri. Yeah, it was. It was two Bandari. Oh, it's two of them. Yes. Okay. All right. I thought I was going crazy. All right. Discussion item V 90 23. Smida van Dory. Request for variances of 7ft lot width at the building line, waiver of the parking area location requirement to validate existing conditions. The lot with at the building line and parking area location and obtain a building permit for the unauthorized gravel extended driveway. 25 by 20 partially located in front of the house at 2014 Woodbury street in Hydesville. What happened to Oprah? Can we see the site plan, please? Do we need to. Does everybody remember. I don't. I kind of remember it. It's the rental property. Woodbury. This is where they wanted, um, a driveway because there's. Permits are required now for street parking, and they didn't want to buy. Right. That's. That's. They're not gonna pass. It's a. No. But there was nothing unusual. Unusual, unique about their parcel, so I don't know if they. I don't believe they meet the criteria. They don't. Can you push that down a little bit, Miss Olga? My computer is very slow today. Hold on, please. It's on fire. Miss Olga, do you want me to share my screen? This is up to you, if you don't mind. Okay, mine's getting better. It's working so slow. B 95. No, 90. No, B 90. It's not be 95. B 90. Okay, I got. Okay, I'm gonna. Whoops. There it goes. This is whole. You got it? Got it. But I think he just made a ruby site plant, which I remember. You're supposed to match the site roads thing. Yeah, hold on. I need said match back to site roads to match the plan. No parking on the side. That's another thing I'm really confused about. That's why we need to sit down, Miss Garnet. When we get site road, sometimes it comes back kind of crazy. With this new criteria. I don't know if we need to be sending to site roads, but it gives people false hope when they say they approve it, and then we say, oh, no, that's true. How it slow is? Yes, this is very slow. You want to use your. You're gonna need to erase something. You have your binders? Yeah. Yeah. Let me look. Maybe look at your binders. What was that? 90? 93. My notes. Not that I can see the picture. My notes say the driveway must match the approval. Go back to the site roads. For site road matches the approval. The side yard driveway must be removed unless site roads approves it. Did they go back? I see two. Did I see two stairs? April? Oh no I didn't. This from April 23. Was there. Revised April 20. Look at it though. I think I find one here. Oh, here's one right there. Parking all. He has parking in front of the house and he has parking on the right side of the house. He went up parking everywhere. The one with the rental property said, oops. Sight Roads said. Can you scroll down a little bit? No, he wasn't the rental. I think they approved it in the apron. Okay. Okay for 25 by 20? Yes. This is the one. They did approve 30. What they did is they broke it down okay for 25 by 20 in front of the house and then a ten by 30 driveway pad and double apron. So they did. Site roads did approve it. Yeah, but is it something we can approve? No, it doesn't meet the criteria. He's no different from anybody else I meets. Not even one. It's self inflicted. Because he added the driveway to the left. Already had a driveway. Yeah. He already did this? Yes. Yeah it was. Yeah, I remember it was already. It's unauthorized gravel extension. So it's self inflicted. Yep. It would be nice if we had one or two of these. We could work around. We're gonna this garner for that. I'm sorry, what did you say? You have to sit here. We can wiggle around anybody. I think we should make a motion. Can we get a second? Madam chair? Aye. Mister Eisler. Our next discussion item is v 90. Miss Holston?

Yeah, but this is the one we were waiting for. Additional information from the permanent expedited. Did we get anything? It was taken under advisement. It was not held for technical assistance. This was unauthorized construction. Yes, but I think we have the record. The last one was we had a neighbor there, Ruth. No, we had. It was the expedited. The permit expedited was the person. And she was supposed to provide some additional information in regards to the permit that was obtained. And that's what we've been waiting for. Right, but he also did that stuff without, like, he did it himself. No. Yeah. I mean, technically, yes, but he hired somebody who he thought was getting the permits expediter. Well, but it's. I can't say anything. Does he meet the criteria? No. Was that Miss Duggar? Miss who? Decker. Anthony Henderson was the contractor. No, that's the brown. Okay, that's why I said we need to double space these. I have room to write. Okay. Anybody want to do something on this one? Can we continue to hold it open? You want it? Yeah. And then maybe try and. Try and contact an expediter again. I can't mean I'm looking at it. We're gonna make a motion and leave this one open for additional information. Yeah, I think. I think he did. He did meet some of the qualifications because he had the corner lot. He had a lot going on. And the way his house was struck was positioned on the parcel. He put his house in the corner even though he has a ton of space in the back. So what is the reason then? We're going to come follow up with the permit expediter. She was supposed by providing some clarifying documentation. I'll second that. Technical assistance. Yes. Okay. Technical assistance. Okay. Okay. You need to follow up with the permit expediter. Yes. Yes, please. If I can spell permit, I have to get a book because I'm getting all my current mixed up. Okay. Can we make a motion? I did. I second his motion. Oh, Mister Eisler and Miss Mac.

Or that's just gonna. We're still on. We're on the wrong one. Olga, we need to go to V two. I'm sorry, which one you want? V 95. No, V two. V 24. Or do you take any decision? Open. We held it open. Oh. How about V 90? Yes. Open to nine. Denied. Okay, all right, let me open V two. I'm sorry, V two. We're looking for the confirmation from Bowie. From Bowie. Okay. For 24. Should be the last thing coming in. I think the computers still acting up. I've got a letter here. Okay, let's see. The Bowie city council adopted revisions to fence setback requirements on April 17. The change was. Were approved by Prince George's county council. What date was on that? What year? There's no date on the letter. The one we had was for 23. In the case 3703 media lane, Bowie. The amendment allows the location of the existing fence to be in compliance with the city of Bowie code. Any replacement of new fence position in the same location will also be in compliance with the city of Bowie code. If there are any questions. Questions? There is no date on this letter. Well, we need a date. That's the main thing. We're asking for the date. Yes, please. I'd like to make a motion that we leave this open so that we could contact Bowie to get a date on their letter for the approval. Hold it open. Will it remember Austin? Second. Hold on 1 second. Please tell our media folks we apologize. We're late again. Okay, who made the motion? I did. And seconded by Miss Alston. Yes, madam chair. Aye. Mister Eisler? Aye. Miss Alston. Aye.

So we could. Don't we have to meet all six? Yes. Would you guys? I think the topography was how we were going to see if clearing the first. Right. But then we still get hit as mountain. On two, three and four. This is B three. Right. Finder. So what's the deal on him? Mister Eisler wanted to see the topography because he was saying that we.

So we could. Don't we have to meet all six? Yes. Would you guys? I think the topography was how we were going to see if clearing the first. Right. But then we still get hit as mountain. On two, three and four. This is B three. Right. Finder. So what's the deal on him? Mister Eisler wanted to see the topography because he was saying that we. We don't know what the surrounding properties look like, so. Can you see it, Mister Eisler? I was waiting on that PG atlas. Yeah, and that doesn't show us. Didn't show us anything. But the thing about it is we still run into a roadblock with the others. Right. Well, if the. If the. They say six has to be met. Which is very, very difficult. Very. So I'm looking at the subdivision plat and where'd it go? All the lots are identical. An old. The plat was 1932, so they're all rectangular lots. They all look the same. You want to make a motion? I'll make a motion to deny. That's it. Our next case is vat. We got a vote. Hi, Eisler. I would have stayed with stain Alston. I and Miss Hill. Aye. Thank you. Next case carries. I'm going to. No, wait. Hold on a second. Three to 130-1301. Mister Gardner, do we this chair back have to read the discussion items in full? You said does you have to read them? You mean read the variances? Yes, since there's poor discussion items and not a new variance. Um. It's within the chair. Go ahead. Yeah, I always thought it was up to her if she wanted to read. Go ahead, read it. Because we. We got to move this stuff. I was trying to save you a minute. As long as when I start stammering, then you do. V. 1824. Frank Uzuma. Request for waiver of the security exemption for a fence over 4ft in height and to obtain a building permit for the unauthorized installation of a six foot fence at 14 two oh eight old stage road and buoy. The record was taken under advisement. 1824. This is the one with the house that was wrecked and he was just gonna build up on the old foundation. Oh, no, this is the one. He's putting up a fence and he's on an easement. And his frontage. That's the one. He said his. His family was being attacked by the dog. Yeah, wildlife. But he put it up without a permit. That was the problem. He. He has since gotten the security exemption for the fence over 4ft in height and to obtain a building permit for the unauthorized installation of a six foot fence. He said his mother in law was being attacked by wolves or something, right? Yeah. Yes, the whole family. Yeah. But his lot is odd shaped and the placement. And the placement of his house. Of the house is behind the lot. He has to access it by easement three. I remember you saying that the. The front driveway. Yeah, that that's the front. Just where that easement comes in. His, his is only frontage. The rest of that front property line is a side lot line. But the only thing about this is it doesn't affect the neighbors, but it's self inflicted because you did it without a permit. Well, but that's the practical difficulty, isn't self inflicted. He. The violation is self inflicted, but the practical difficulty is the fact that the house was constructed, was parceled out in the way that it was, and the home was placed on the land in the way that it was. And that's the practical difficulty. He didn't do that itself. Chair isler number six are the criteria. Self inflicted. If you build without variants, are permit that self inflicted. That's everybody. That's everybody. Yeah. That's a denial, ladies and gentlemen. We cannot use compassion. We have to be, we have no goes and olsens. Well, I mean, I don't want to get into everybody's politics. I'm just trying to understand. Yeah, please. Thank you. I'm sorry, say it again. Let's not call names. Yeah, yeah. CB 16. I'm just trying to understand how the practical difficulty is self inflicted. If the practical difficulty is a lot the way it was. He had a building built, but the thing about it is the violation is because he installed a fence without a permit, but he had a need to because of the way they set his house up and then he couldn't. We have to look at legislative intent of CB 16 and legislative intent. If you build a job permit or you don't get a variance, or you don't come to the county in the first place. Right. That's self inflicting. I've been reading this and I'm just, I've been. That's why I want to talk to Miss Garner about some wiggle room. So you threw me to the curb, miss? No, no, because y'all know how I feel. What? Lead the pack. Tell us what you did. No, Mister Watson, I just, I'm just, I'm just trying to make sure I didn't understand the legislative intent was. Read it. The first thing is we have to follow the law. The law says they have to meet all six criteria. If there is one that they don't meet, we cannot approve a variance. Yes, I understand, but I'm just saying if we disagree on what the practical difficulty is because there's a different interpretation of what the law is, we have gone through the first one, he meets the second one, he meets the third one, he meets the fourth one. He meets the fifth one, he meets at the number six. So if he meets number two, it results in a practical. If that's not the practical difficulty that's being referenced in number six, it appears that he just shouldn't have built in advance. Sorry, madam chair, for interrupting. Is this.

The record was held open to allow the petitioner to revise the site plan to move the fence back from the front corner of the house and obtain an HoA approval for the location of the fence. Right. This is the one where she had it, I think, going up to the front of the house, and she wanted to move it back behind the trash cans. Yeah. The plan was just wrong. It was. Okay. Yeah. And then she had the Hoa letter that was either not signed or didn't have an email address or something. Yes. Did she meet the criteria? Well, she was going to submit that stuff. She met the criteria, I think. Cause she had a pentagon shaped blood, didn't obstruct views. She was willing to lower the fence. She just hasn't gotten her permit yet. Mm hmm. Miss Hellos. Did she submit a revised letter? She did not. She said that she's having some difficulty getting in touch with the HOA, but that she has screenshots of their approval in their system and wanted to know if we could accept that instead of a letter. Okay, so do we want to hold this one open until we get some word from her? Um, I mean, I have the screenshots. Um, I don't share. Can we look at the screenshots just from the homeowners association, from there, from their website or their system, which is the way most of them are. Okay. Kind of moving to. Um. Yeah, let's look at those. They're not in the binder, but they are. Give me one moment. Okay. I've gotten everything all mixed up. Oh, we have an approved email. Is that what it is? I don't think so, but I might have sent it to you. I don't see. I don't actually see it in the folder. Okay, well, we can help. Okay, I'm looking at one. Oh, that's from January. No, it's not it. Oh, she actually sent this recently. Let me teach it for. Okay, so should we just hold this one open? Yeah, I think so. The binder. So I do have the screenshots. I can show them now, but you. What did she need a revised site plan for? Just showing that the fence. The line on the plan was she moved back behind the house. Yeah, behind the front of the house. Okay, wait, can you share your screen? She did submit that. There's no. Yes, she did. Um, I I'm sorry. I I know it's three. It's 1253. We get it. We got our text support. They with us.

Request for variances of 7ft front lot, 7ft lot width at the front street line, 5% net lock coverage and 4ft rear yard depth. And to validate existing conditions, the frontage width at the front street line, rear yard and lot coverage and obtain a building permit for the proposed screen room at 8911 Palmer street in Fort Washington. And I just want you to know that this evening I have gotten four emails from Miss Crockett. And the first one says, we're still waiting, please. The second one. If we can just get an approval tonight. Was it a notice issue? I see a recorrected notice for re review and revised site plan for the rear yard. It was held. Oh, okay. Can we see the site plan and I will explain it all? You. This is. Is considered a corner lot. I had wasn't. Yeah. Everything is completely cleared up and I was 100% wrong. Why were you wrong? Once the site plan pops up, I can explain it. Was this the one we saw where. Because the whole front was curved. It was one. I had said that this is not considered a corner lot, but it actually is a corner per the definition of corner lot. Therefore the. This isn't the same site plan I saw. It is this one. I don't remember all these stamps all over it. Okay. Because the last time you say that, you were considered, the front yard is on the right side. So that means the rear yard needed the variance. Actually thinking she doesn't need any variants except the lat coverage. That's what I. Rear yard. I thought we said that last time because she had the curved front. She had only two side yards and there was no rear yard. I was completely incorrect. Oh, okay. I was completely incorrect. This is a corner lot. The front yard is the 45 degrees 40. Can you make that a little bit bigger? Please say that again, make the picture a little bit bigger. A little bigger. Okay. Is that enough? Yes. Okay. So the side along Palmer street, that is 50ft. That is the front yard. So the opposite of the front yard being the rear yard abutting lot 23. So I'm reading the variances. Request for variance of 7ft lot width from the street line. 5% net lock coverage and 4ft rear yard depth. And to validate existing conditions, frontage, rear yard and plus, they had gotten. They've already gotten variances. That's what it was. They already received variances for. Miss Holger. Go back to the. They already got the side yard setback. So I'm thinking, okay, let me go to the file and I will pull it out. I think I have a decision. Final decision here. One of them taking too long for this one. Now. I know, Miss Crockett. I know. You're watching. Yes, she is. She is watching. Okay. V 104. Scroll down to the very bottom of the hearing notice. Okay. Keep going. Keep going. Oh, that's old. Yes. She has two variances, I think. Okay, keep going. You want me to keep going? No, keep going to the very bottom. Okay. Where the decision is. Keep going. Is this old? This is there. Yes. Stop. Okay. Unanimously that waivers of the fence location and height requirement for a fence over 4ft in height in the front yard of a quarter lot are requested and ordered. And that was approved. So she does not need anything for the fence. Now go to the other one. Look, Bobby Mack approved it. The other one is for the garage. Can you open up the other. Carter's handwriting. It is. So where do we go from here? Hold on 1 second. I thought I kept that. Here it is. I found it. Okay. Okay. This is a corner lot. When I fill out my forms, I'm gonna have to double space so I can put enough room for notes. Okay. She doesn't need a variance for. You can go back to the site plan. Go back to the site plan. Okay. Yeah. Request from. Of 7ft lot width. So we didn't get what we needed on this, huh? Yes, we did. Okay. Because what we needed was me to fix my brain. All right. So now that your brain is fixed, is it something? Can she pass the. Christina? I believe she can, yes. Um. She does not need a setback from her screen porch. See, this is. This is the old plan. This isn't the new plan because the screen porch isn't on here. Oh, hold on. This is the old plan. This is the old plan for the all decision. I'm sorry, the plan that she submitted originally to us. See, that's exhibit 17. Okay. That's what's throwing me off. Okay. Okay. Saipan certified. Can she meet the criteria? That's what I want to know. I believe so. What about our board members? I think we agree that she. She did, but we were trying to see about this. I'm just trying to wipe out. Oh, there. Here we go. Okay, so on the right hand side where the garage is, they got a variance for, um. The setback for the garage. They do not need a setback for the screen porch because that's a side where it says lot two. That's a side side yard. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is a corner lot.

She still needs the seven foot lot width at front strip, 5% lot coverage and 4ft rear yard depth. Did anyone want to make a motion? Actually, she doesn't need the four foot rear yard depth.

And obtain a building permit for the construction of a proposed six foot vinyl fence, eight foot vinyl fence and a 15.33 foot by 18 one story addition at 4311 Quinn street in Capitol Heights. We took that under review. Could you open that site plan, please? Wasn't this the one where we were trying to see if they took away some of the patio and driveway or other covered areas that would alleviate the need for a variance. And all they would need was a security exemption. Well, no, they don't need a security exemption for the back. Right request. Correct. But request for variance of 25 sqft net lot area. Bless you. Thank you. Can we see the subdivision plot, please? Oh, it's not unique. Yeah, that's what we were trying to figure out. If there was a way to, you know, cut their lot coverage so they wouldn't need the variance. Subdivision? I don't think. Okay, let me organize here. We can see subdivision products. Oh, right here. No, they're all the same. Yeah. Yeah. That doesn't even meet the first one. But they only needed what? 7%. 7.6% net lock coverage. And so I think in looking at the site plan they had a little patio in front of the driveway. If they were to be able to take that out. We want to see if that reduced their net lot coverage. But we still need the. Still need the net lot area. The 25ft lot with the 12ft lot frontage, 7ft front yard depth. Do they still need the net lot area? What they need to let. Oh, yeah. I lot that goes with the land. That doesn't go with any. Anything that's built. This is those older communities and we said we're never getting. I take that back.

Thank you, Reverend, for joining us this morning. I was hoping that you could keep in your thoughts and prayers this morning as you lead us just the conflict that seems to be happening in our world, in Israel right now. May we find a sense of peace in all of us, some harmony and God's calming presence in our lives. And may we find some commonality of just finding how to make our world better for each other. I also would like to ask if you could keep in your thoughts and prayers this morning. Just my family, as we're experiencing the loss of my aunt. She lived 96 years, 96 years. Took a fall, and after that fall, two weeks later, she was gone. I do understand. Just keeping her in our thoughts and prayers as well, but also thank you for being here this morning. Thank you. And you and I talked before you went over to Israel, and I do understand. And for one whose aunt transitioned, we know that they're in a better place. Although it's difficult to deal, the degree of our mourning is the amount of love that we have for our family to include dad, who's 84 years old, God promises 70, 71, 72. But to have 84 is a wonderful experience. Thank you. We still have more. Oh, we still have more. We have councilmember Oriada. Oh my friend, thank you for being here. Just now. One of my staff, Imani, her grandmother was in an accident. She's rushed to the hospital right now and so I just want to keep her grandmother in our thoughts and prayers and make sure that everything okay with it. Family who was in an accident? We have a father, we have a family that's hurting, one that took loss and then another family in an accident. Are there more? Mister Burroughs, my champion. Thank you pastor, I just want to ask for you to pray for a special blessing for Reed Temple, for all that you do in the community, for young people, to seniors and everyone in between. And thank you for being there for us and many things you've done before you ever came to this chamber. Thank you for everything you've done. Are there more? I have two people I would like you to keep in your prayers. Thank you. One is Lela Price. She passed recently. And her husband Fred Price is an upstanding member of the Cheverly community, a former council member, and he is bereft. Fred Price and also the family of Lorena Royster, everyone who loved her. She was tragically murdered about a week ago and lived in Bladensburg and was enthusiastically loved by all who knew her. So her funeral was yesterday, we had a vigil for her on Sunday and I just don't want people to forget her. Thank you very much. Absent from the body, present with the Lord. Mister Hawkins. Thank you madam chair. Pastor, if you would. Would you pray for those two kids and all the young kids and children who have been in recent fires and all the tragedy those who are still living are going through, and pray for those young people who are dying on our streets and those that are involved in those crimes. Pray as only a preacher could pray, and hopefully in some kind of way to touch their hearts. And lastly, pray for the council family. Even though she was buried last week, I'm sure many of them hearts are still heavy from the loss of Miranda Jackson. Wanted to bring that to you and thank you for being here. The Bible says the effective fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much. We should pray without ceasing. And I thank each member of this wonderful band of county leaders that dare to ask for prayer, because it is through prayer that we find peace. Please allow me to introduce our team of prayer partners. We have with us Darren Bell. Darren Bell serves as our executive director of our CDC at Reed Temple. Then we have Pastor Joseph deck that will actually deliver the prayer. He serves as our pastor of pastoral care as well as the pastor of Wayman AME Church. Brother Bell, just wanted to say God bless. Good morning. Thank you for having us. We are located in district four, and we love working with our council member, councilmember Watson. Amen. Let us go into a place of silence and let us pray. O Lord and our God, we come at this moment, at this hour, seeking your divine wisdom and your divine guidance. We pray for the leadership of this council, the county executive. We pray for the county council, the administrative support, the clerks. We pray for first responders. Lord, school systems and housing requirements. Lord, we pray for those who may be marginalized by society, economically, spiritually bereft in so many places. But now, Father, we look to this place of prayer with a specificity that was called out. And I believe you've already dispatched angels to go to those places. We pray, lord, for the longevity of life. A father was celebrated 84 years old. And we thank you for that legacy that continues to give wisdom to a family that I believe the cup will overflow to other families and replicate itself in love. We celebrate mothers and fathers, lord, there's conflict. There's wars and rumors of wars all over the place. But, Father, I believe that one d", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Reed Temple AME Church", "insights": [{"observation": "Reed Temple AME Church in Glendale, Maryland, engages with the community by providing support to young people, seniors, and everyone in between.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Reed Temple's Community Development Corporation (CDC) executive director, Darren Bell, is part of the local parish team indicating organizational structure and community engagement.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Reed Temple AME Church", "insights": [{"observation": "Reed Temple AME Church in Glendale, Maryland, engages with the community by providing support to young people, seniors, and everyone in between.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Reed Temple's Community Development Corporation (CDC) executive director, Darren Bell, is part of the local parish team indicating organizational structure and community engagement.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 2245282, "chunk_end_time": 2726094, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3485?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3485?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=2245"}, {"start": 19000, "end": 25000, "text": "ce and let us pray.

But the fall didn't end down here because I prayed as she fell right into your arms. Your ever loving all comfort the family, Lord, in this place, Father, there was a grandmother that is in an accident. God, I pray right now that there will be angelic assistance where she is. Let the guide doctors hands guide emergency rooms hands. Let them know there's some things you can learn in medical school.

We know that weeping only endures for a night. But, Lord, if we keep on walking, the joy will come in the morning. And we know that there is a place called heaven. There is a place where there is no. No more weeping and no more crying. And, Father, we thank you for hearing this prayer. We also lift up the name of Leila Price in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, as she's gone from labor to reward. We pray for a morning husband Fred. We pray for a mourning family and a family in a community that is missing her. On this side, Father, we lift up the name of Miranda Jackson, Father. Whose roles she may not answer. Roll down here. But there's a heavenly roll where the lamb's book of life will open up. And that name is found. As she walks, we pray for churches and synagogues and mosques and all over this county, Lord and lord. But we want to spotlight Reed Temple, African Methodist Episcopal Church. Lord, may it be a shining light, a beacon. Lord, a way station for the lost so that they can be found where hope is. The major product that's manufactured, that comes from the pulpit through the ministries. God, we ask this in your name now, Father, as we close this prayer, as the civil laws are enacted here. When the ink is flowing onto the paper, let the color of the ink be bound with wisdom. Let wisdom flow through righteousness. Let wisdom flow through justice. Let wisdom flow to a place where compromise will come and food deserts will be historical poor and poverty will be historical record. Lord, at the end of the day, we love you and thank you for this council. In Jesus name, amen. Amen. Thank you so much. We'll now be led in the pledge of allegiance by council member Watson. Thank you all. God bless. Thank you very much. We have a few requests by the general public to address the council. The first is Mary Durkin. Can you please come forward? Good morning. Thank you for this opportunity to speak to you. I'm here on behalf of my son. As a student athlete in Prince George's County. I think that it's already been well documented this morning that you all understand the importance of athletics to our students. I'm here because I not sure where else to turn at this point. My son is a senior at Northwestern High School. This year. He started his school career at University park elementary School. In his fifth grade year, he was diagnosed with ADHD. I did, after his 6th grade year, pull him out of pgcPs. He was one of 30 students with one teacher in the classroom, which I don't hold against the teachers, but it just. It wasn't the right fit for him. I did pull him out of PGCPs and move him to a very small private school where he did his middle school years and his 1st, 9th grade year. That was also the year that Covid hit, he did not pass that 1st 9th grade year. At that point, he really wanted to return to pgcPs. He felt like he was ready for that. He had done some growth, had some improvement in his adhd symptoms and was better able to handle that. But also he is a baseball player and that is a huge motivation for him. He started back at Northwestern High School as a 9th grader. I did bring a few documents with me which I'm not sure if you have access to right now. You can leave them with the clerk when you're done. Thank you. One of which is a transcript from PGCPs from mid last school school year indicating that he was a 9th grader twice and then a 10th grader and 11th grader last year. Unfortunately, this year the athletic board has decided that he was a senior last year. That is the rule. They're citing that he is a senior again this year for the second year and they are not allowing him to play baseball. Sorry. He's missed half of his season now. I don't know where else to turn. The principal and the athletic director at the school declared him ineligible. They're telling me that his transcripts declare him ineligible. I appealed to the athletic office and they also declared him ineligible. I have reached out all the way to the state level athletic association and they're pointing me back to the county.

I'm not really sure what else to do at this point. But I mean, I have documentation that he repeated his 9th grade, not his 12th grade and the year. I've also provided you with the letter of ineligibility as well as an impact statement that my son wrote on his behalf. He meets all other eligibility requirements. He has played only three years. Miss Durkin. Yes. I really appreciate what you're bringing to us. And as a mom, I totally get what you're going through. And my children also went to Prince George's county public schools. But would you please leave your paperwork with the clerk and I promise you I will look at it today. But your three minutes are up. Oh. Oh, dear. Thank you. Thank you very much. Next we have Rosanna Weaver. Good morning, everyone. Thank you. I brought a prop. This is Northwestern High School 2019. And we actually don't traditionally allow the use of props, even if it's innocuous, because the next day it could be something really offensive. And I trust you, but I can't trust anyone. I will just say on there planned one is going to say all around us, it's not going to be as good without the picture we remember. Go ahead. That group of kids, Raymond Gonzalez was the one on the far left. Then it was Darian Belle. I saw Darian yesterday because he was at Northwestern's game again. He graduated, went to an HBCU, is back here and comes back to his old team's games. And Adonis Escara was on there too. His mother, Denica, who some of you might remember Danica, did a lot for. For Prince, Georgia county, worked in Langley park with immigrants and so forth, and passed away from COVID in early 2020. And I wanted to bring that up because none of us know how many more opportunities we have to make memories or to make friends. So the final person on there is my son Eric, who's korean and adopted. And again, this picture if like, it looks like an aide ad, right? It's five kids from a variety of circumstances. And they all had a great experience through baseball. And the reason I brought this picture. So Eric, who I'm most proud of, my son, has come back twice now to help coach. And so he's here this spring to coach because his brother is playing and also because one of his very best friends is playing. And that's Sandro. He moved from Indiana. His fiance's upset. We're all working through all that stuff, but he prioritized this. And, you know, I brought the senior day picture because it's important. It doesn't feel like, I know we're all dealing with many, many huge things, but for this kid, he didn't have a senior picture because last year when he played baseball, they told him he was a junior. We all agreed he was a junior. That's what's on the transcripts. That's what's on everything. Arbitrarily. At the end of the year, they thought they, Prince George's county schools thought they could maybe clear some numbers if they forced him to graduate early and decide that he was a senior arbitrarily. And Mary had to work very hard to even get them to have a second year. 9th grade, 12th grade. Have me. Sorry. Well, first year in 12th grade. Anyway. Anyway, it's just such an absurd thing that a little request can't be honored. Thank you so much for bringing this to us. And we'll be in communication with the school board. Thank you. Okay. Did you want to say something? Okay. Mister Olsen. Thank you, madam chair. Yeah. And I also am going to look at the transcript and the materials that you submitted and be in touch with the school system. I trust you've also contacted the school board members I'm sure you've done that. So we will look into this. Thank you. Finally, we have Miss Akoma love. Well, next. Is she here? Oh, she is here. Thank you, Miss Love. Okay. Good morning, everyone. The prayer I heard this morning, I truly felt left out, and I felt the homeless population left out of the prayers and the intentions. I don't want to start with. We have abandoned our responsibilities to our own race, which makes us worse than the heathen, the Bible says, and it's time for us to get black to business. The homeless population is overrepresented by our people. And I've been coming here since March 5, and I truly feel the coldness and the left outness, not just for myself, but others. I'm not going to go into details, but homeless people have no rights, and we have no voice. We have no choice. And it's time for us to declare our independence from homeless services, which is slavery by another name. Three points. One, I'm happy that God gave me the vision to rename PG county, which is Prince George, who the heaven knows who Prince George is. Anybody know who Prince George is? Raise your hand. Well, forget that. Praise God county is the new name for PG County. George, Duke, Duke of Earl, Jesus, overall. And we'll be taking the steps to make that official. And it's time for us to blanket the world with the african fabric of society. We have been whitewashed too long. We have been whitewashed entirely too long.

Men's black History Month banquet will be May 3 is James Brown's birthday. And of course, say it loud. I'm black, and I'm proud. Okay? If you've never been black, you don't know what it feels like to wake up every day and have to feel like, you know, you have to put on your defense mechanisms. Okay? It still takes a village. And integration destroyed every foundation that black people had built, starting with tulsa. Everybody knows that story. If they don't, they need to do the research. Over 40 square blocks destroyed. Over 300 lives massacred. And then the rest became homeless. Over 10,000 people. So you don't create homeless services for the founders and owners of Black Wall Street. Homeless Services is slavery by another name. And I'd like to know, what is the penalty for committing the act of slavery? And I wanted the young people to know I did have a chance to talk to some of them and let them know we never needed homeless services. We never needed homeless services. And again, I want to reiterate PG county. That's got to come down. Praise God county. We are one nation under God. I heard the pledge of allegiance. Praise God County God over all. Jesus over all. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Love. Today is legislative day number nine. I will now go to our consent agenda for the approval of county minutes dated April 9, 2024 for county council and also board of Health. And now we will go to the first reading of bills CB 29 2024, an act concerning juvenile and minor curfew zones for the purpose of allowing commercial property owners the ability to request the police chief to create zones within the county with a more restrictive juvenile or minor curfew providing for the application for a more restrictive juvenile or minor curfew zone, including the specification of the area covered following reasonable geographical boundaries providing that the proposed area is primarily commercial providing that the applicant demonstrates the ability to provide notice to the public of the more restrictive juvenile or minor curfew zone and providing the applicant represents the district containing the more restrictive juvenile or minor curfew zone and other related provisions. This is to be presented by councilmember Burroughs with a referral to committee of the whole CB 30 24, an act concerning untraceable firearms and minors for the purpose of adding and incorporating the state code definitions related to firearms to the county code, including the definition of untraceable firearms to the list prohibited to the list prohibited loaded weapons sorry prohibiting the transfer of untraceable firearms to minors and increasing the maximum penalty for each violation and other general provisions related to untraceable firearms.

This is sponsored by the chair by request of the planning board, and it will need eight votes if we are to suspend the rules prior to adoption. Let's see. Miss Zabakas, are you here? No. Is Kathy Canning going to speak? Who's going to address this one? Oh, Miss Zabakos is here. We're on the resolution concerning the Yates and Mary Boswell House. We're ready for a staff overview. Good morning. I can provide that. This resolution is the final step in a process that is authorized under the land use article and set forth in your local laws under subtitle 29. Specifically, there's a process by which a property owner can petition to have their property considered and ultimately approved for designation as an historic site within the county. If you'll recall, this property, which is located in councilmatic district three, came before you all in a joint public hearing with the planning board in January. And on March 5, the planning board staff. Excuse me. The planning staff came back and did a digestive testimony and reviewed the planning board's recommendation, which was to approve the proposed designation of this property. And so there was a motion to direct staff to prepare a resolution of approval, which is before you now. And so this is the final step to approve this designation. Thank you.

Chair Harrison. Thank you. I'm present. Vice Chair Watson? Present. Two members present. Thank you so much, Mister House superintendent, you are before our committee today to give us a presentation on the athletics and the athletic field presentation that we have at the Prince George's county public school system.

Excuse me, chair Harrison. They're having a little it problem with the presentation. They're restarting it, so it should be available shortly, I believe. Okay, well, we have our copies, so why don't we go ahead and get started. Yep. Okay, so, Miss Diggs, why don't we go ahead and start with slide one? All right. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm here to discuss some of the field use that we have in Prince George's county public high schools. And so I want to go through the slides very quickly. For the first slide, we talk about the start dates and the first play date and the championship dates. Those dates are set by the state Maryland Public School Athletic association. And so we follow that calendar. And what you see, I'm not going to just go through all of it, since you can see it. But as you can see, from August 14 to December 7 is the longest sport in the fall. Winter goes from November 15 to March 15, and spring is March 1 to May 25. Those are the times and dates that the entire fields from the county are used daily. Okay. And on the next slide are turf fields. We have eleven turf fields that we use. And as you can see, the schools that now have turf and the grass fields, we have ten fields. But at this point in time, Suitland high school is being built, rebuilt, renovated. So they are now using Forestville High School as the grass field. Okay. Going on to the next one. In the fall, sports, mainly football, boys soccer and girls soccer are the sports that we use. All the fields. And I mean all fields are used all season long for the fall. There's not a time where they're really empty, except for Sunday, because we are not allowed to do anything on Sunday. If you go to the winter sports, of course, there's not very many. We use the fields, so that's when our fields are empty. It's cold, so we don't use them. Our indoor track team will sometimes go outside, but other than that, we do not use the fields. Come spring is very busy. We have outdoor track, boys and girls lacrosse on the fields. We have softball and baseball on the other fields, which many times people want to rent those fields. So we are in full force. But what I would like to tell you about spring is that we also have middle school soccer. And so those middle school soccer teams have to.

So we are in full force. But what I would like to tell you about spring is that we also have middle school soccer. And so those middle school soccer teams have to. They don't really have good fields for the middle schools, and so they have to use some of the high schools. And we actually use all of these fields for the state championships, the semifinals, all of those things. So again, they're being used constantly. Now, the grass fields, it's hard to use because they just don't hold up long enough. When you put soccer on it, you put football on it. We can't use it for anything else. Middle schools they actually, what's important is spring sports, boys soccer and girls soccer. Those use all of our high school fields also. So this is just letting you know who all is using our fields constantly for the lawn maintenance. The maintenance of the field, including baseball and softball, which includes mowing and lining the fields. Classic lawn covers high point. Laurel Duval and Roosevelt Blythewood. They cover all our other fields. And the contractors are responsible to provide routine and annual maintenance to ensure a safe playing surface on all middle and high school athletic fields. Now keep in mind, when those companies come out, they are lining the field for the next game. They are cutting the field for the next game. They are monitoring it. So, you know, it's hard because if other people come onto the field and ruin those lines, then we got to call them back out to put the lines out. School practices, as you can see, it's very packed in season teams, open fields. Open field means the school can use it for the other sports just to do workouts. Conditioning seven on seven leagues for football is using the fields. So pretty much we go from Monday to Friday from after school, which is anytime from about 230 to 09:00. And those are the fields with lights. And we have practices all, all day, all night. For those Monday through Friday. After school to 630 are the schools with no lights. So your grass fields, some of our turf fields, don't have lights. Saturdays we are using the field from 08:00 a.m. to at least 03:00 p.m. sometimes we have to do some makeups, which could take the fields on Saturday evening. And the other thing is, our fields are used by three charter schools. They don't have fields, so they use our high school fields and international schools. We have two international schools that also use the high school fields. So we have to schedule them between all the other games and then all the playoffs for high school and middle school. So that just gives you a little idea of how much our fields are used. Thank you so much, Shirley. And so, moving into the memorandum of Understanding with Maryland National Capitol park and planning, this was an agreement that was brokered to begin on July of 2023 and is set to take a hold over three phases. Phase one is currently in effect and shall apply to all artificial turf fields and any future schools that also have a turf field. So currently that includes eleven of our facilities moving into the following year, meaning July of 2024 to take effect. The phase two of the MoU shall consist of additional PGCPs facilities and fields in the north, central and southern counties as negotiated by PGCPs and Maryland National Capital park and planning. And then finally, phase three shall consist of all PGCPs facilities and fields for all schools as negotiated by the two entities, and that should take effect July of 2025. The MoU speaks to how fields, and ultimately facilities will be reserved. The current reservation process always has the school system holding priority when reserving its fields and facilities. So the athletic directors are responsible for entering all practices, game times, and field use into our online reservation system. Following that, Maryland National Capitol park and planning is to schedule their events. And then Maryland National Capital park and planning at that point should open the reservation system to schedule third party users. I'm going to turn it to director Taylor to wrap us up to talk about stadium renovations. Good afternoon. So, actually, I'm sitting next to our subject matter expert on the Turffield installations.

The ones that we have identified here in terms of next products and pipeline. The first one up is Laurel High school. So Laurel has been in construction roughly seven months, and we're nearing the end of that. The turf field has been installed, the track has been installed. Bleachers and press box, et cetera, all been installed and will be finalizing the rubberized track surface here this summer. And at that point will be completed there for Frederick Douglass. We're actively in permitting currently for that one, responding to some of the requirements associated with. With the permitting phase. And then from there, and then contingent upon the funding being approved, we'll be able to move forward with Frederick Douglass. Next up, we have cross and high school crossing high school. We're kind of pushing forward in multiple tracks with that one. We have a aging school program grant that was provided by the state in which we'll be able to move forward with the bleachers and press box. We're currently, have already demolished those bleachers and waiting for final permanent approval to be able to start with the installation. And so we're moving forward with that one. And then contingent upon the CIP approval within FY 25, and also the approval of the $9.2 million grant with Board of public works. We'll also be able to move forward with a portion of that work as well. The next one after crossing, we have Duval High School, which is going to be requested during our FY 26 CIP for funding for that project. Typical schedule that we have for all of these projects to take into consideration, all phases. So approval of funding, procurement of our design, build team, going through the design and permitting process and construction phase, ultimately turnover. You're looking at it roughly two years at the point that you actually have approval of funding and are able to utilize that funding. And so that just gives you the typical schedule for that. There's often times that we're able to beat that schedule, but that is typically just a rough order of schedules just to, you know, to consider next slide that we have, just talks about just typical improvements that we include in our state and renovation projects and rough costs associated with it. And so that all is contingent upon site conditions, additional stormwater management requirements, et cetera, that are required, but typical. We'll do replacement or transition from natural grass to turf will correct some of the non compliance issues related to our track surfaces. Oftentimes they're not in compliance, so we're not able to actually hold events in some of these locations. So at that point, we'll actually demolish the entire track and make sure it is within the national high school requirements to be able to have competitive meets at these facilities. In addition, we'll add storage facilities, press boxes, bleachers, stadium lighting, egress lighting, things of that nature, to make sure that it is a safe and inviting facility at night when we're hosting our night games. Average cost that we're seeing is roughly $7.5 million. And that's give or take. Some are lower than that because it doesn't need the full replacement. Example, Bladensburg already had existing bleachers, so we didn't have to move forward. Press box and bleachers there. And so that came in less. But a project such as Frederick Douglass, it's a total renovation, right? It needs everything. So that would be around that $7.5 million mark. And then the last thing that we had on here is really just talking about where we are with the climate change action plan and some considerations that we have. You know, we, part of the board's approval of that actually mandated the transition of all turf fields back to natural grass. I think that based on some of the advocacy that we're seeing and whether from constituents, communities, athletic directors, coaches, et cetera, the need for turf field is there, and that is something that we're working with our board to try to understand exactly what options that we have related to continuing to move forward with turf or actually transitioning back to grass field and themselves. And so that is something that we're actively working through. And hopefully we'll have resolution on that here soon. To be able to move forward with Frederick Douglass or actually Crossland will be the next one up. And that's the conclusion of my presentation. Thank you, sir, for that presentation. Thank you, Mister House Superintendent House and Doctor Coleman, and your entire leadership team, Miss Diggs, for the presentation, we're going to go to questions.

Thank you, sir, for that presentation. Thank you, Mister House Superintendent House and Doctor Coleman, and your entire leadership team, Miss Diggs, for the presentation, we're going to go to questions. I see councilmember begay has her hand raised, and we do have a quorum just for. So sorry about my tardiness today. I just wanted to ask a question. We have received multiple concerns at Largo high school about a turf field there. It is my understanding they do not have one or looking for serious upgrades.

And he said that this has been brought up to you all's attention, that we met, my staff met with the entire. The leadership there. And this has been a concern that I remember hearing last year. So is there anything being done about the turf fields and Largo high school? So before my team jumps in, what I will say is, as we share this insight, I'd love to ensure that we understand better the. The average costs, because turf fields are extremely costly. And it also, I think it's important for us to understand the climate action plan and how out of alignment it is with us moving forward to move turf fields in over the idea of grass fields. So with that being said, well, I'll let you go ahead and share some insight that be a feasibility student. Okay. Well, regarding Largo high school, we have a party list, and that party list was identified. I want to say 2016 ish. 2017 ish that identified just the party in which we're moving forward with the replacement renovation of all of our high school projects. This is something that I think, you know, I'm very passionate about, you know, being alum of Prince George county public schools, being an athlete as well, knowing the extent of a lot of our counterparts in other communities, that they've had turf field for quite some time. And so I don't think it's. And also with the passion our colleagues have, it's not a situation of not wanting to move forward with turf. I think ultimately the issue is, you know, we have a large need across the board, you know, and all of our facilities, not just athletics. And it's also trying to have that balance of funding needed to make sure that we're making our modernization, school replacements, etcetera, but then also having fun in for athletics improvements. And at that point, it's not so much just going in and installing turf fields. It's, you know, the comprehensive renovation to make sure that it's the, you maximize your usage for each facility. So Largo, we would go in and replace lights, and I think their bleachers are fine there. We would have to expand their track because their tracks also is not compliant. In addition to once we have resolution on the turf field, currently Largo is slated after cross. Then we'll have Duval Central High school friendly Parkdale, and Largo would then be next. And so it's quite, what's the time down in a priority order? Is there any way we can move that? I mean, what is the process of moving things up to? Because we've heard, I mean, Largo has been some of our champions, and we would like to make sure they have adequate turf build. So is there, what is a way, maybe I could talk to you offline of what we can do to bring this. It seems like it's pretty much a long way from now. You know, from an equity standpoint, I think regardless of whether a school is winning a championship or not, we want to provide students with the best possible. So we have a, you know, a system in place, as Will has talked about in terms of the timeline. Will, is there any other information that you want to share? Can we get a year? Or. I mean, what. I mean, what can we get right now? So it's hard to commit to a year because it's contingent on funding. And there's been multiple years in which we thought we were going to receive funding for the stadium category, and we didn't receive anything. And so, you know, even this year, you know, we're anticipating receiving 3.5 for Crosland, but as of right now, that has not been approved and it's not earmarked for crossing at this point. And so it's hard to commit to a year understanding that, you know, there's so many variables, whether it's dealing with the state and trying to get grants and approval for that or whether or not going through our CIP and get approval. So if we just look at, if we just factor on our CIP crossing would be somewhere around maybe FY 30, 31 ish, and that's contingent on getting approval each year. If we do not get approval for that statement category. It then pushes them out, you know, each year because that funding will be needed for whatever that priority school is within that order. Currently. Councilmember Bogey, just for the record, you know, I've been on the council six years and they've been talking. Frederick Douglass High School has gotten pushed back a bunch of times. Obviously, the need is great and the funding is short when it comes to that. And so as you can see, Frederick Douglass has pushed back again a little bit because the funding is not necessarily there. I would encourage you, if you would like, maybe Mister House having an opportunity follow up with councilmember begay about a meeting because we are getting state funding for it. Do think that we should actually get some county funding, too, but we've now reached out to Senator Charlton and he's going to get. Be glad to check. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Councilor boguet. Well, I will say chair Watson of government operations and fiscal policy has some questions for you, but she's the vice chair of this committee. Good afternoon, and thank you so much for the presentation. Appreciate that. I just have some questions. Okay. So in regards to Duval, which, of course is in district, I know the bleachers were fixed last year, I believe, or not too long ago, but I wanted to find out what is included in their renovations.

So in regards to Duval, which, of course is in district, I know the bleachers were fixed last year, I believe, or not too long ago, but I wanted to find out what is included in their renovations. So we have not moved forward with the bleachers at Duval right now. That is part of our FY 25 agent schools program request to get approval for that. That, and hopefully once we get approval and we expect an expedited timeline on that, we'll be able to move forward with those improvements. Regarding their bleachers and press box, Duvall, in terms of just the scope that will be included upon reconciliation of funding for that project, will receive the entire scope replacement there. So, of course, we have the bleachers, press box, you'll have the turf field, we'll have led scoreboard, we'll have stadium lighting, egress lighting. Also, you know, their track and field events, you know, shot put, discus, et cetera, high jump, long jump, pole vault, and their track as well. Okay. I guess. And if I could, if I could just add a follow up to that. Thank you. We also had our building services team contract for a contract company to go out and review the specific needs at Duval's Field, given the fact that we've heard some issues around playability, and we are putting together a short term plan to address the immediate concerns at the field, notwithstanding the broader stadium renovation that will take place. So you're looking at making some renovations prior to the full renovation because I know some repairs to the field to make certain that it remains playable. I would say it that way because I know, I know. Councilmember Olson sent an email last year regarding the dangerous bleachers that we had received email and we heard that it was fixed. We did repair the bleachers and we are continuing under our building services team to ensure that any obvious dangers to the bleachers are taken care of. I think what Mister Smith was speaking to was it's an old set of bleachers that are not AdA accessible and they need to be updated holistically. But as far as making them safe for people to sit in them, that has been taken care of. Okay, thank you. Appreciate that. Also wanted to ask about. I know you all mentioned the natural grass product as opposed to turf, or is it the same? Can you explain a little bit about that, what the natural grass product is? Is that real grass or is that actually a turf product? Just wanted to. Yeah. So natural grass is your lawn. It's natural grass. Right. Versus the turf will be a synthetic turf field. Right. I just thought you mentioned. Okay, so the turf is actually more of an expense than the natural grass. Well, I will say it's a different expense. Right. So it's more of an upfront cost when you install, but in terms of the maintenance, the payability, the usage, the lawn mowing, et cetera, lining, etcetera, aerating, seating, that is a long term cost that then becomes equitable. Right. And so in the turf product usually lasts about ten years. So our warranties, I believe, are ten years for that product. And based on your, you know, how well you maintain it, you condition it, you know, and make sure that, you know, you're following the guidelines for maintaining the fields and filling properly, it can extend well beyond that. But it's also, it's really based on just making sure that we are maintaining it properly. We're also, I think in terms of the usage, that also plays a huge part of it as well. But typically we're seeing north of ten years. Do you ever do a combination of both or. No. Everything is either all turf or all natural grass. Well, in terms of our, the priority for, or the objective for the state and renovations to date, it always has been turf fields. We have not moved forward with installation of grass fields, but I think that that is part of the climate change negotiations to figure out exactly what that party is going to be. An objective going forward will be. Right. And I'm sorry, I was kind of, when you said natural grass product, I was thinking, oh, was there something new that kind of looks like grass that isn't turf? So that's kind of what I was thinking. So I get the natural grass as opposed to turf. I get that piece. So. Wasn't trying to be crazy about that. Also, you know, I get a lot of emails from my constituents about disposal of turf product. So I just wanted to find out what you all do in that regard when you're disposing of the turf from the fields. So we hire or we contract with contractors in order to perform the state and renovation projects. We haven't been at a place where we actually had to replace at this point, but ultimately, the scope would be required for them to actually go through, to demolish and to recycle the material based on their objective or dispose of it based on their methods. Okay. Yeah, because I guess one part of that would be, it would be great to kind of have them outline how they're disposing of that just so we can be aware and I can share that with the environmental side of my community. They just want to make sure that it's properly disposed of. So would love to get that information.

They just want to make sure that it's properly disposed of. So would love to get that information. Also wanted to find out, you know, you mentioned the new high school stadiums with the fields and a track includes lights. So why are the lights not being installed for the turf fields at the new middle schools? That was the question I was told. My question, the Jason Washington. The reason why is that it's not part of the school systems program for middle schools to have lights. So it was more of an equity is that none of the middle schools at this point have lights for their fields. And so the, the lights have been provided at the high schools. So that was the global reason. And why. So does that mean they're never getting lights? I will never say never, but in terms of priority and cost, the priority would be the high schools first. And so because that's where all of the athletic activities are taking place, all of the competitions, et cetera. But that would be a policy decision across the board for the district. Thank you. Thank you, madam vice chair. I'm going to chime in real fast to piggyback on that last question. I'm looking at the MoU, and I understand that the new high school fields have track and have lights on their turf fields. But on the MOU, it says each county board shall encourage the use of public school facilities for community purposes. Right. So the high school fields are community purposes. Middle school fields should be deemed community purposes. And then, so I think that the board is going to have to figure out, you know, how we do implement lights at these middle school fields, and what is the cost when it's associated, because everything is a cost and effect. And I get that. But just to say, well, we focus in on the high school fields. Well, the high school fields have a lot of competitions. You know, those fields are getting used up. You have your middle school fields. How many middle schools do we have in Prince George county? Over 30. 30. How many fields are at these schools? At the middle schools, do you know? Double that. Okay. So when we talk about community purposes, you know, that is some number of an assessment that we would have to get to make that understanding what that investment is. As you all know, there's been a challenge about how we implement community purposes at our school fields. Right. And what's the role of Merrill National Capital park and planning in this as well. And it's been a balance. Montgomery county, they've been doing it for years. It seems to be successful. I don't understand why we are kind of late to the game about how we implement these things. And then there's a cost effect of, like, who is responsible for the wear and tear on the field? Is it the school system? Is the Maryland National Capital park and Planning Commission? Is it combined effort? Like, how do we assess it? That. I think that we need to find the answers to that. So that was more of a statement. Another thing that I wanted to ask about. I noticed that Frederick Douglass, and this is in my district, but Frederick Douglass High School has been pushed back, you know, and I get the field assessment, but inside the gymnasium, they don't even have an air conditioning. That works all the time. Right. So in the spring and summer times, it gets extremely hot in there. And I know that I put in the CIP budget a couple years ago for the renovation for a new air conditioning handler unit to be put in, and it was supposed to be, supposedly supposed to be done. But I understand how budgets work and things get, you know, mixed around. Where are we on that? Do you know? Do you have any answer to that? I'm going to defer to our capital programs team. I know they can provide an update. I think we need to follow back up with the response on this question so we can make sure we get accurate information. Very good. I appreciate that. And then lastly, councilmember Fisher, she's not present with us, but she would like to ask a couple of questions. Number one, if the data shows we are doing well, considering the children with the most needs, how are you promoting the success and informing the residents of that? I guess she's talking about curricular programming, the success of our students. Got it. One of the things that we'll continue to do, and I actually shared with my chief of staff earlier, one of the things that we want to do is come back here to the full council as well as to the, to this group on a couple different occasions a year to provide kind of updates, not only from an academic standpoint. So next year you'll get that request for me maybe once during the first semester, once during the second semester. We also want to make sure that from a communication standpoint, that the information that goes out to our community, whether it be press releases on how our kids are doing, all the different celebrations in terms of scholarships, because our kids are doing some amazing things, absolutely amazing things. So we want to make sure that you all get that information as our school community is getting that information.

So I look forward to coming back and having a regular cadence to share a presentation on where we are in our strategic plan blueprint and other important pieces of our schooling puzzle. Do you think you'll be ready by September? Absolutely. All right. So we look forward to seeing, you heard that director, committee director. All right. So September. We'll look forward to that. Number two, she has a question. What are we, what are you doing to recruit and retain school bus drivers? I know that you just sent the transportation plan over. I just received it, so I'm going through that. But that was one of her questions. What are we doing to recruit and retain school bus drivers? So I'll defer, I believe Director Baldwin is here from our transportation department. But as you all know, and as you probably have heard, we moved forward with a significant step in the right direction in terms of transportation. We completed an extensive audit with an outside organization that allowed for us to really take a look in the mirror in terms of what we want to do and what we need to do for our 85,000 students that are a part of our ridership. Recruitment is a major part of that. But efficiencies that we're finding as a part of this audit should help with that as well. Director Baldwin, I know you. Thank you for that. I'd like to pivot to the other Baldwin, Chief Baldwin, our head of human resources. Good afternoon. I am Christy Murphy Baldwin, chief of human resources for Prince George's county public schools. Not related to our wonderful director Baldwin, no pun intended. So we are very actually proud of our recruitment and retention plan. We actually, the audit that Superintendent House had done, they pointed out that we had a very robust plan. We spend a lot of money to make sure that we post different advertisements. If you ever go through the NBA, you'll see a rolling billboard of come drive with us. We have a major brand campaign and different kiosks all throughout the county to recruit our bus drivers. One of the things that Superintendent House pointed out is the challenge, though, with our bus routes. So having the number of people versus how many routes we have to run on a given day are two very different things. And I think that is one of the challenges when it comes to staffing. And I believe Chief Coleman, as well as Superintendent House reference every single day. We start with 300 routes that cannot be covered. So although we have the bodies, we don't have the routes to cover those individuals or those specific routes to get the children to school. So we are hoping with this change in the bus time, that it will reduce the number of routes that will match then the number of individuals that we hire. Thank you. And how many bus drivers do you think we need to hire for this upcoming school year? So, every year we run between. For the number of routes, we try to have at least 200 to almost 300 drivers. I'm gonna. Did I have that right? Okay, perfect. We do try to hire between two and 300, so we've been pretty good about doing that. We also have a rolling basis of our CDL program. So we do offer free CDL training. And so that is ongoing. So every week we are bringing in new people and they go through the program. Unfortunately, one of the things that we have a challenge with is our biggest competitor is Wamada. So being in the DMV presents a significant challenge, because once people earn their CDL, the doors open up for them. So that's why we really are looking forward to this change, so that we can create a better work balance for our bus drivers to get more individuals to come. I would also say that we're also market competitive, too. You will often hear that we're not paying our bus drivers equal compensation to other school districts, and that is not true. We are markedly competitive. So we try to stay on the pulse of that. And if we ever see a change really working to try to see how we can increase it so that we can have a really good recruitment and retention plan for our bus drivers. And follow up to that is, when you talk about two to 300 that you're looking for, how many applicants do you think you average during that process? And then, of course, you have criteria, you know, some of them just don't make the cut. But when you're looking at a pool that you're trying to hire from, what is that total pool? So that's a wonderful question. Our pool, however, is almost 500 or even more. We have a lot of people because of our recruitment campaign that was like, oh, yes, I can drive a bus. I can drive a bus. So we have a lot of individuals who will apply to these bus drivers, but it is a very long process, and that is one of the areas of growth that we need to work on, because there are lots of different criteria between physical exams. People have to be in good shape. They have to, they have to go through the CDL training. So there are a lot of requirements to become a bus driver, and ultimately, a lot of individuals will begin to drop out.

But I'll go back and get it. All right, well, make sure you send us that information Saturday between nine to twelve at. At Laurel High School. High school. Y'all gotta come down south. What's going on with this? Gotta come all the way down south. Yeah, right. All right. And one last question that Juanika had was councilmember Fisher. With all the blueprint money and supplies and resources met with all the blueprint money, are supplies and resources met for our children? Why do children still need supplies and backpack giveaways? How are the needs of the children being met? You know, it's interesting. These needs are reciprocal needs that come on an annual basis. As a father of a student that runs through a couple backpacks a year, we know that those needs will not stop. So whether it's the incredible philanthropic support from our community, whether it's blueprint, whether it's the county, we know that these needs will be there on an annual basis. Quite frankly, sometimes even more than an annual basis. We also know that our kids come with needs beyond the classroom as well. The supports that our students come with in terms of mental and health support is extremely important. So we are doing our best to meet those needs head on and ensuring that we press rewind every year to ensure that regardless of what was provided in terms of support the previous year, that we're there as a county, we're there as a school district to ensure that we beat those needs again, and I would say to make sure that the principals operating budgets at some of these schools, they have enough resources to provide for the supplies and needs of their children, of the area that they're serving. I do hear often that the teachers and the principals are always pulling out of their pocket because their budgets are so strapped and strangled that they're pulling out of their own resources. And those are things that individuals can't even claim on their taxes anymore of that tax deduction removed. So just make sure that there's some sensitivity in that matter when it comes to funding in certain high performing areas, you know, in low performing areas as well. I know the chair, Ivy, has a couple of questions, and I know councilmember Olson has a couple of questions. So thank you, mister chair. Thank you all for being here today. I appreciate it. We all know how important sports are to our students, and it made me look up a couple of things. This is from the state board of education. Whereas the Interscholastic Sports program is an integral part of the education program, whereas it is essential to promote healthful living, character building and good citizenship for students through competitive sports, whereas emphasis shall be placed on equality of opportunity, wholesome competition and safety of participation. So that's from the state and then our own Prince George's county public schools philosophy. It is our belief that athletics is a way to achieve a balanced educational program for our students in middle school and high school. As we all know, athletic competition, by its nature, will contribute to greater student awareness of self discipline, a growth in emotional maturity, and an increasing realization of the worth of the individual. So I think those are important statements that kind of acknowledge how important sports can be to students. And especially some students are coming from backgrounds that might be particularly challenging, and they look to sports as a way to succeed and to have a reason to come to school every day, because otherwise you might feel like, I'm not really doing great anywhere else, but at least I can go play soccer or basketball or whatever and be a part of a team, and it helps with their emotional growth. But we have a rule in Prince George's county that is different than Montgomery county, for example. The state has a certain rule about students being able to participate in sports and for how long. And all schools say you can't be past 18 years old, and it says a maximum of four seasons in any one sport, and then, which is fine, but our policy, the way it's interpreted here, is interpreted differently than our neighboring jurisdiction. So if someone has perhaps had a year in 9th grade that it didn't go well for them at a different. In a different school system or, you know, private school, I should say, or home school or whatever they were doing. And then they come to Prince George's and start again in 9th grade. That grade, that year of 9th grade seems to be counted against them here in a way that is not counted against them in Montgomery county because the state doesn't require that. That's something that we have done to our own kids.

That grade, that year of 9th grade seems to be counted against them here in a way that is not counted against them in Montgomery county because the state doesn't require that. That's something that we have done to our own kids. So I think that it would be wise if, given how important sports are to these kids, if you have had reason that you had to repeat a grade, then chances are you have had enough of a challenge in your life that the sports are there can help you. One of my kids repeated. What grade did he repeat? I think it was 8th grade, not because his grades weren't good, but he had such a crappy year that year that we sent him to private school for a year and actually was two years because he repeated 8th grade and then 9th grade and then came back and has done extremely well in his life. And he, you know, this didn't affect him because he wasn't trying to play sports. But I know that you can have a bad year and regroup. Right. So what kind of consideration can you all give to changing that policy so students aren't being impacted by that, that they are able to continue to play if they haven't played the four years? I'm not saying change it so they can play more than four years. I'm not trying to change that. That's a state law or a state policy, but it's our own policy that it's keeping these kids from playing. And who could address that? And I'll start off and then let miss Diggs, who is one of the individuals responsible for our athletics and PGCPs, as a former high school athlete that went to school on a full college scholarship as well, I understand the importance. What was your sport? Basketball. Don't let the height fool you. Would not. I could handle mine out there. But what I will say, I completely agree. What I've got out of sports has really been equated to a lot of leadership lessons that I've gained in life. What I also have learned about the sports as a former coach at the high school level as well, is that we're in a day and age that between travel ball, club ball, AAU, EYBL, BCI, our kids, in many instances, are playing a number of games, even if they don't play. Many kids don't even play for their high school teams because they're the competition level with travel ball, AAU, EYBL is so extreme. There are a number of kids in Prince George's county that are playing in some of the best travel ball, best EYBL teams in the country right now. So, quite frankly, the number of dollars that are spent outside of the school system in these kind of private summer, or not even summer throughout the year, is incredible to see. We also know that, you know, from our general counsel to the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic association, that while it's in alignment and the Maryland Athletic association allows for school systems to have some variants. You mentioned Montgomery county. I'm not necessarily familiar with it, but from my perspective and my experience, it's important to think through the body mass, everything that goes along with a fifth year senior, because it's an opportunity for that individual to be bigger, stronger, whether they're playing travel ball, EYBL, AAU, BCR. But that could happen just because they were held back in first grade or they started school late because their parent didn't think they were ready. I mean, now you're kind of overdoing it. So I'll let miss Diggs kind of jump in a little bit here, but I just wanted to share. I wanted to your point from somebody that played sports in high school and then played county, played semi pro my 10th grade year because I had a reading level of a second grader, because I had dyslexia, which hampered my grades, which I could not compete, you know, so I had to go find another outlet to be able to keep up with my athletics. Right. So we don't want to get into a position where we're penalizing somebody. Yeah, we have standards, but you also have variances, like other jurisdictions do, where they're making these decisions to make sure that the child is not getting penalized. When we get into conversations about body mass and height and everything else, I think that's something we need to stay away from. Okay. Like, we don't need to lead with that. And I respect the fact that you play ball, you coach ball. I play ball, and I coach ball as well. Matter of fact, I coached her son. That's right. Many years ago. So I think that we gotta find a balance. I think that's the point the chair is trying to make, is where is the balance? Instead of saying no, what kind of example are we saying? Just no. Like, there's no conversation as long as they meet the age requirement. I don't understand what all of this is about. If you don't mind. I'll let miss Diggs kind of share some of the details here. So I want to start with when Maryland state allows the local school systems to do what they need to do with the rules and regulations, you can go stricter, but you can't go less. If you look at. So not all schools in the state allow you to play after your fourth year. Not all. The other thing is, there's other stipulations that the other parts of the state have that we don't have. So, for example, Montgomery county, if you have one e, you can't play. Done. A couple other places have. If you have two e's, you can't play.

Matter of fact, I coached her son. That's right. Many years ago. So I think that we gotta find a balance. I think that's the point the chair is trying to make, is where is the balance? Instead of saying no, what kind of example are we saying? Just no. Like, there's no conversation as long as they meet the age requirement. I don't understand what all of this is about. If you don't mind. I'll let miss Diggs kind of share some of the details here. So I want to start with when Maryland state allows the local school systems to do what they need to do with the rules and regulations, you can go stricter, but you can't go less. If you look at. So not all schools in the state allow you to play after your fourth year. Not all. The other thing is, there's other stipulations that the other parts of the state have that we don't have. So, for example, Montgomery county, if you have one e, you can't play. Done. A couple other places have. If you have two e's, you can't play. Prince George's county allows you can have e's as long as you have a 2.0. So there's different things that causes a county to allow different athletes to play once Covid hit, I must say, we had so many reclassifications. Now, many of the counties, I know, Montgomery county does not allow reclassification, and neither did we. So when they were trying to reclassify their senior year, they wanted that fifth year. Some only needed one credit to graduate. When you only need one credit to graduate, that's hurting our graduation rate. And so we're keeping them here. When they could have taken summer school, they could have taken whatever to go ahead and graduate and move on. But right now, we're getting so many kids. It's not just one. It's not just two. We have kids that are still trying to reclassify their senior year. And, you know, I don't. As long as they're. I think that you have to be under 19 before August 30. If you're 19 before August 30, then you are not eligible. Right. So as long as they are within the age requirement, why are we being so hardline? Because we want to be able to affect our graduation rate. I mean, I think the real. I think that's important. Well, I'm not sure it's unimportant. I'm just saying that's up to the parents to figure out what's best for their child. Just like I decided it was best for my child to. I think he repeated. It was 7th grade. He repeated, and then he went on to 8th because he hadn't learned anything in 7th grade, even though he. Look at their transcripts from the 9th grade, they have a's and B's. Mm hmm. Why do you need to stay a fifth year? You have a's and b's. You're doing great in school. We don't know. They could have some personal. Mike, they could have some personal family things that happen within their family. We don't, you know, life happens for us to sit back and judge and say, okay, this is definitive of why this has happened, and then penalize the child. I think what I'm trying to avoid, and I can only speak for myself, is that we're not getting in a posture or position where we're penalizing the child. That when we know that sports teaches every aspect of life, every life lesson, you still use it today. Right. So why would we want to block someone from that opportunity? And I think that's where we are. Well, that's where I am with it. It's like, how can we have a conversation about this? Because I don't know if that's working. And normally, when you shelter someone out from not being able to contribute or be a part of something, other things lead down that road. Right. And then what happens with that child as they moved on? Because they've been sheltered out. So we don't want to isolate one child from another. I don't think you all want that, either. But I think we got to find a happy medium about how we create an opportunity that other jurisdictions are doing that we might not be. Are there kids who don't have a's and b's who would fall into that category? Very few, but they move on. They've done summer school. They do whatever this is happening with our a's and b's, kids that really are good students. And I think it's happening with other kids, too, though they're the ones most likely to be struggling. It may be we have kids that have stayed back. You know, that's in the 10th grade again. 10th grade. And they can keep competing. They can compete until that fourth year, but until they're 19, it should be, well, as long as they're 19 before the end of August. That's what it should be. Being an athlete myself, I just feel like I'm right with you guys as an athlete, and I just feel, you know, get your grades. Some of them are failing on purpose, I must say that, because we have seen that just so that they could stay the next year. Well, really? Is that what we're. Is that what we want to teach? But we don't make policies based on some outlier somebody who. The one person who does something wrong. I mean, I would hope not. I think that the policy should be more like what you state and your philosophy about how important it is to kids health. We all know how important it is to their mental health, you know, and we, you know, we want to make sure that kids have the opportunity to succeed and that we're not creating a framework that keeps them from having these opportunities. Not one of our neighboring school districts, also about the same size, is doing things in a way that's still within the state law, but allows children to participate. So I think. Councilmember Olson. Oh, go right ahead, Councilmember Olson, I know you wanted to. Yes, thank you. I appreciate this conversation and I support everything that my colleagues have said here.

And that's what, you know, and one example came to us and that's what opened the floodgates on this to, I think, the councils, we weren't aware of this. And, you know, if you're talking about, you know, the emotional well being of students, you're talking about motivation to go to school, you're talking about a whole host of things. You know, athletics is important. And anyway, I just, you know, I think that we really should be revisiting this. I hope it can be revisited. It sounds like it's a policy that we can not, we, not the council, but we as the county, we as the school system control. It's not, it's not something that has been mandated from outside. So what would it take to have that? Is that a school board decision or is that some other decision, administrative decision? Yeah, it would be the school board. And what I can tell you both, chair Ivy, as well as council member Olson, is that I will at least take a look at the data. I'd like to know how many kids and kind of what the circumstances are. I don't have that data in front of us and at least take a look at the balance and see if there is an overarching issue here versus the idea of outlier scenarios. I think there are quite a few things that we have to pay attention to in this kind of scenario and not setting the standard to be too high, not setting the standard to be too low in finding that, ensuring that we have that sweet spot, because if we do, you know, we don't want to develop a scenario where the system can be played or opposite, where a big mass of kids are not getting the shot that they want to have. So I will at least commit to taking a look at that data to see exactly where we are. I appreciate that, and I also can't believe that it would be of the school system size that we have that this would be affecting the graduation rate and all. I mean, that's that many. That it would sway things so much in one direction or another. So I do appreciate you looking into that. I think there are also students who take more classes and can leave early. Right. I mean, that can happen too, but with the way the state calculates graduation rates, which is cohorts, that actually wouldn't necessarily help the district in terms of a student graduating early. That'd be nice. Okay. I'm just saying that there's a whole variety of things that happen, but. But you know what? I don't want to see, and I don't think anyone here wants to see, and you either. I mean, we're all in this together is, you know, we don't want, you know, our students to be hurt in these scenarios. So. So thank you for looking into that. And mister chair, I hope that we will get a report back on that through your committee. I'm not a member of the committee here, but I do appreciate being able. Thank you, mister Superintendent House. You heard the kind of call to action that council member Olson has just made, and you agreeing to look at the data, how soon do you think, or how long do you think you would need to look at that data? Is there something you could follow back up on? Be glad. I'd be glad to follow back up with you within. We are in before. We are in May right now, so before the end of the month. Okay. All right. Isn't there a compliance officer who could give you that data for school? For sports? I thought that we had a position like that in the school system. You're the compliance officer for sports. Oh, but I am a former athlete. I'd like everyone to know track and I will get out in the 200 any day. So I do have, we do have a compliance officer that works within my division for sports. Not, not specifically for sports. So I think if, if before the end of May works for you all, my team can work to make sure that you all get that report in your hands. Thank you so much. I did have another topic, and I think I'm obligated to say I also was an athlete in high school. All right, what sport? Soccer. Oh, soccer, too. All right. Also baseball and basketball. Jv I didn't grow my height, did limit me in basketball. So I wanted to ask. So last time you were here, I asked about Parkdale High School and the field conditions there. And I actually just did a satellite view on my phone of it, and I don't know when that picture was taken. It is. You know, it's a grass field, which is fine. I'm actually not one of the turf. I'm not terribly enthusiastic. I think the climate change stuff is very important. But the conditions of the Parkdale field are not good. I mean, they are. It's a hard dirt, rocks, that kind of thing. And I know the wear and tear does make. That does impact that. I know you mentioned that it is in the queue at some point in the future, but, you know, it's, you know, I continually hear from parents and students at Parkdale, and actually, my daughter played against Parkdale on that field, and, you know, was a rough field to play on that. It would be great to see that field retrofitted as a turf field. I mean, as a. Not as a turf field, as a grass field. So that the playing conditions and the safe and that it's playable.

We can do a pilot in terms of if we're looking at the climate plan and we're going to be doing, you know, looking at how we can do grass better, maybe we could start there. But I think that that's something that really needs to be looked at, you know, outside of. Outside of Parkdale. One of the things that I've learned at one point, was in charge of operations at one point in my career. And it's interesting because it, especially with the grass fields, it boils down to, what are the soils? You know, what are the soil levels? What kind of absorption rate are we getting in the soils? And it's even more interesting, you know, when you look at some of our fields in Prince George's county and the fields and the soil levels, because that drives a lot of the cost in terms of whether you put a new grass field in or whether you're just grading it. Because if the. If the. If the soil levels and the ph balance is not where it needs to be to redo, that is extremely expensive. So a lot of it boils back down to cost as well. But going back specifically to Partsdale, I'd be glad to have one of our team members to. There's miss Stefanelli. Yep. Thank you for that. We'd like to have director Stefan Elliott come up to speak to Parkdale. Okay, terrific. Good to see you again, mister Stefanelli. So after our last meeting, I went parked at myself. What happened was about five years ago, the athletic director, his parents got together and thought they were going to help us and they were going to redo our field. Dumped like 14 truckloads, what they thought was fill dirt onto the field and ruined it. So we had to go through, we cleaned it all off, we redid the field, we put new topsoil down, planted it. But what's happening now is the gravel that you're talking about is the gravel that was, it got embedded into this thing and it's rising. So we're going to have to take some, some drastic measures there again to get that field back. And I apologize for, I didn't realize that that had happened. I thought we'd take care of that issue. Okay. But we're going to have to do some, some work there because what's going to continue to happen is if anyone knows if there's gravel in the soil, it's going to rise to the top. So that's what it continues to do. Our staff is having a tough time keeping grass growing there because of the ph balance. So we're going to have to do some extensive work. The issue I'm going to have is funding. It's about to redo a football field just in normal basis, about $400,000 once you get through doing all the soil preparation and then layside down. So we're looking into that right now. $400,000. Okay. So it's okay. Thank you, Mister Stefanility, Mister Superintendent. I'd appreciate it if we can do something about that. You heard about the gravel? I mean, it's gravel field. I mean, like it's, it's, it's a danger to students who are out there playing. So, mister chair, I guess we'll have more conversation, but I do hope that we can address that sooner rather than later. You know, Councilmember Olson, you were making a good point about the field, but you have the athletic director trying to help out, did the wrong thing, and now you have to remove everything off that field and bring in new dirt, new soil, new sod, everything. I hope now that moving forward that there's a, some sort of rule in place that does not allow, you know, the athletic directors to say, yeah, I'm going to just go get some dirt, because that's problematic. Yes. Shortly thereafter we established a, a committee that before anything happens in any of our schools, they have to fill out a form because for a committee, Doctor Coleman and I are on that committee and we determine whether or not, they could move forward. And when a contractor is going to do work, they have to sign a no cost contract with us that outlines all the legalities of that. This did. This really wasn't in place back then and it wasn't have followed, but moving forward, we have those things in place now. Sure. Thank you. Not to that, but if you wanted to follow up on. You go ahead. I'll catch up. I guess I just wanted to ask about senior skip day. Are you all aware of that? And what precautions do we take around that?

And then some insight into kind of how we're monitoring social media. That'd be great. Mister Gary Cunningham. Good afternoon, everyone. So we do coordinate with the local police departments. They have a homeland security division. They monitor all the social media that's out there regarding senior skip day and any other events involving our kids. In this particular case, we got the information late. The information was given to local police departments. That's why they were able to go to the park and stage, but as they were staging, the incident occurred. So as a result of that, we have put in place an intelligence liaison officer. He coordinates with the police department. One of the things that we're doing is we are monitoring social media as well as the local police departments. They also have students that work with us to monitor social media. The issue down at the national harbor, we pay attention to those type of events, so we coordinate as best we can with the intelligence throughout all the police departments in the area. Thank you, madam chair. Thanks. Sorry to be skipping around. One thing that you mentioned was when you said $400,000 for grass fields, does that mean where'd he go. He's right here. Okay, sorry. When you said $400,000 for grass fields, did you mean that would be the typical cost for a grass field at a high school? That's the price. We recently received a quote to remove the grass, add two inches, fill dirt, put in a new irrigation system, and then lay sod and roll the sod. So would effectively give you a new. A new field with the proper soil underneath of it. But what I will say is that that can look a little different from field to field, depending on what the needs are at that particular field. One example, I can't remember which council member it was. Actually, it was someone in one of our delegates that had a question about a particular high school that had extreme costs. It was above and beyond what. What some of the other fields were. I think, like, it was a Saddensburg high school. It was a couple million beyond that. But a lot of it had to do with the irrigation, the soil levels, and it was a previous contractor. Yeah. So it's really interesting. So they're all. I just. I just share that because they all can look a little different, and the variants can be sometimes pretty extreme in terms of costs. Right. So. But I guess we can assume that a grass field would be a lot less expensive. The problem is just, you can't use it as intensively, and the upkeep is ongoing. It might be cheaper. The superintendent is correct. That does not include any drainage. This is on a suitable field we don't have any drainage issues with. So Parkdale, for instance, has a drainage issue in the corner, so it may be a little bit more expensive. And, of course, Bladesburg, we have a spring up there, and it has a. We have severe drainage issues. So that would escalate the cost. Okay. On top of the soil type, because it was built on clay, so that created an escalation in costs at Bladensburg as well. Right. Yeah, I remember how long it took to get that field fixed, and that's a turf field. And I also just want to remind everyone, I'm sure you already know, that there are not just environmental impacts with turf fields, but potential health impacts. And if it's very hot out, then the kids can't use it, and then, of course, the fumes that come off of it can be an issue. So I just wanted to put that out there. I know people love turf fields, and I'm not trying to come down on turf fields, but just to keep everything in mind while you're considering the climate action plan, it's also a health impact. So back to sports. So if you can only compete for four seasons, because that's what the state says, and you have to be under the certain age, you can't turn 19 before September 1, that should be sufficient. I would think, and I hope you all will consider that, because the impact of not considering it is detrimental on actual human beings who go to school every day with maybe nothing else to hope for. And also the compliance officer. I don't know that, that, whether that would be a whole job, but in order to determine eligibility. But we have had some really bad things happen the last couple of years from not having that position. I guess it is, or not having anyone take that job on, because I know flowers high school. They. I don't think I have to remind everybody. Pardon me. So we had two situations. Yeah, flowers high school was really bad. I know Northwestern is that one that you're thinking about. Had. They had a situation where there was a kid who just pretended to be another kid, he took someone else's identity with that child's agreement because his own grades weren't good enough, so he used someone else's name. And you can't expect the volunteer coach who's not there during the day to know all the kids.

And you can't expect the volunteer coach who's not there during the day to know all the kids. So you had some kid who wasn't any star player. We're not talking about somebody who. Oh, it's just a ringer. They're trying to get this really good kid in. No, you just had some kid who wanted to play. Nobody else knew or said anything. And then these. This team had been, like, state champions or something the year before, or at least county champions went on to the state champ. No, they did win. They won the state championship. So anyway, their year is going on. It was really wonderful. And then suddenly the rug was pulled out from under them because probably some other coach at another school was kind of hating, turned them in and said, hey, you got a kid on there. It's not eligible. And a compliance officer would have made a difference. Maybe the. I don't know what the school's athletic director is responsible for. I have no idea. But it seems like someone should be responsible for that. Of course, you really blame the child who told the lie. That's who needs to. Even though he. Even though he probably did it just because he just wanted to play and his grades weren't up to it. I get that, but you can't do that. But then the whole team ended up suffering, and so those are the two. Did you have another. So, no, what I was going to mention is that not pointing out one particular case or one particular school. We do have a process at the school level, because our schools and the adults at our schools know these athletes better than anyone. Most of these situations are adult issues where we've had to hold adults accountable because adults knew what was going on. I think in the case at Northwestern, they tried to say that about the coach, and they took it all the way through the state, which was the decision, was. It was not his fault. Yeah. So what I can't do legally, is get into any particular coaches, students, schools. I think that one was before your time, so you wouldn't know. Got it. Wasn't that long ago, but it was before your time. Got it. Your mic's not on. If I could. There's several different circumstances for every one of these that has happened, and I think that there are many reasons. Like Superintendent House said, adults are involved. And because the state doesn't decide something, it's still, when you come back to it, all of us in here that just said we were athletes. Okay? We're all athletes. I wasn't, but I was on the rifle team. Okay, well, then the rifle team. Let's put the rifle team, because that would be important. Don't mess with me. I was a sharpshooter, so that one would be important. If your coach didn't know who you were, there's a little problem there with the adults. So your adult. No, no, no, no. Head coach. Your adult should know your team. That. So I'm just saying. So when Superintendent House said the adults are involved. Yeah. You know, we can't even a coordinate, even a compliance person wouldn't find that. Well, the athletic director at the school certainly would. True. So that person should be held accountable. And everybody was held accountable. And madam chair. But the. But the coach was blamed. I'm just saying, sometimes you have somebody volunteering and you're gonna drag him in. He's gotta, like, I don't know, hire an attorney. I mean, you're paying money out of your pocket to volunteer, and then you get dragged through the mud. It's not right. Yes, madam chair, I just wanted to add. I know Superintendent House committed to taking a look at this and maybe providing some information back to you all, but I also wanted to let you know that there is an AP that is currently in review and administrative procedure that on the administrative side, we're reviewing at the moment. So I can't give a timeline. Exactly. And what would that include? I don't understand it. It is an administrative procedure that outlines that will outline the gray area that you're speaking to around the four years of play versus being a fifth year senior. So that's under review as we speak. And how long will that take to get reviewed? I would not like to give a definitive timeline, but what I can commit to is to trying to get an update on that by the time we share the information with you before the end of May. Okay, thank you. Does anyone else have any of my colleagues have any other questions? Seeing none. Can I get a motion for adjournment? And we want to. And we want to thank you for creating some time in your day to come sit with us and talk with us and answer our questions. It's our pleasure. We truly appreciate that. Yeah, we appreciate all that.

Prior CM zone requesting approval of a special exception to use approximately 3.34 acres of land in the CES zone located at 10810 and 10812 Deval Street, Glendale, Maryland, for a consolidated storage facility. This is in council district four. The appeal by date is February 20, the review by date is February 20 and the action by date is June 7, 2024. Opposition is Shawn Suhar on September 21, 2023. Maryland National Capital park and Planning Commission technical staff approved with conditions on January 18, 2024. The zoning hearing examiner approved with conditions on February 12, 2024. Sitting as the district council, we elected to make the final decision. We will have orientation by park and planning staff. Dominique Lockhart good morning, Madam chairwoman and members of the district council. For the record, I am Dominique Lockhart with the zoning section of the Prince George's county planning planning department. The case before you, as mentioned, is SPE 202-2002 titled Glendale Self Storage Duval street. The proposal is for a special exception used to allow a consolidated storage building. The subject property is in planning area 70 in council district number four. More specifically, the three acre site is located in the southwest quadrant of the intersection of Glendale Boulevard and Lanham Severn Road. The image to the left shows the subject site outlined in red is located in the CS commercial service zone. The image to the right shows the subject site was previously located in the CM commercial miscellaneous zone. The application is proceeding under the current zoning ordinance. The site is currently not in any overlay districts. The aerial photograph shows the site is mostly vacant and undeveloped with the exception of an existing sale tower which is to remain. The topography map shows the site contains moderate slopes throughout the property. This slide shows the master planned rights of way in the vicinity of the site. Shown in green is Lanham Severn Road which is a collector road to the east of the site. Shown in red is Glendale Road which is classified as an arterial roadway. This slide shows the existing conditions of the subject site and the existing cell tower. The subject application is for the development of a three story, 135,873 square foot consolidated storage facility which requires a special exception. The development was evaluated according to the requirements of the 2018 Prince George county landscape Manual. The property is also subject to the provisions of the Prince George's County Woodland and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Ordinance. The submitted tcp two shows the Woodland Conservation requirement of 0.56 acres is proposed to be met with off site mitigation credits. These are the architectural elevations for the proposal. On the left is the view of the consolidated storage building facing Lanham Severn Road. On the right is the view of the building from Glendale Boulevard. On the left is the southern elevation facing Duval street which will contain the primary entrance for the building. On the right is an elevation of the building from Glendale Road. In conclusion, on October 5, the planning board transmitted their recommendation of approval with conditions of the subject application and associated tcp two to the Zhe, which was heard on January 18, 2024. This concludes staff's presentation. Thank you. Thank you. Next, we will begin our oral argument. 30 minutes. We will begin this time with the applicant. So if we could start with Matthew Tedesco.

Good morning, madam chair, Mister vice chair. Members of the district council. For the record, Matthew Tedesco with the law firm of McNamah here on behalf of the applicant, Arkland Property Company, LLC. Good morning and happy Eclipse day. I suspect we'll all be done today to bear witness to that, so just want to thank you all for the opportunity to present before you this morning on this application. As Miss Lockhart indicated, the technical staff did review this application planning board as well, and we had a four plus hour hearing before the zoning hearing examiner on November 28, I believe. Madam chair, Mister vice chair, members of the council, I'd be remiss if I didn't start my presentation by just acknowledging that this case originally did not start with me. This case originally started with my former law partner, Mister Dan lynch, who unfortunately passed away on November 8. So about 20 days after his passing, this case was heard, for which I stepped in at that point to represent our client and see this application through. With that being said, I did want to just thank staff for its technical review of this application, as well as the hearing examiner and Mister Brown People's Zoning Council for their attentiveness as well as their recommendations and decisions in this case, which all recommend approval of the special exception. With me this morning, we have every member of the development team and those who testified at the zoning hearing examiner not necessarily needing to be heard today, but obviously available in all parties of record should there be any questions or any information that the council would like to hear directly from them. But we have Mister Steve Creighton who is the vice president of development and construction for Arkland Property Company, LLC. His testimony is in the transcripts at pages 29 through 54. We have Miss Emily Dean, who's a professional engineer at Kimley Hormon Associates. She testified as an expert civil engineer. Her testimony is provided pages 54 to 92. Mister Mike Lenhart, professional traffic engineer, testifies an expert in traffic engineering with Lenhart traffic and consulting. His testimony occurs at pages 92 through 111. Miss Rebecca Brown is a registered architect and lead accredited professional architect with BWD Architects. She also testified as an expert in architecture at pages 111 through 143. Mister Ed Steer is with us this morning. He's with Valbridge Consulting. He is an expert in the field of market analysis and testified at pages 143 to 184. And finally, our expert land planner, Mister Mark Ferguson with site design is also with us this morning and his testimony is found at pages 184 to 198. With the exception of Mister Creighton who testified on behalf of the applicant, all five other witnesses provided uncontroverted expert witness testimony, both oral and written into the record. As Miss Lockhart indicated, the application before you proposes a three story consolidated storage unit, approximately 135,000 sqft with approximately 15, just a little over 1500 community space for a nonprofit. 40 parking spaces are proposed as well as four bicycle parking spaces. The uniqueness of this property and some of the architectural elements that we utilized really has to do with the fact that Glendale Boulevard, Maryland 193 sits about approximately 20ft above the site. In other words, the site sits down in a hole from Maryland 193 and we provided exhibits at the hearing examiner presentation that exhibit 30 in particular, which provided street views of the building superimposed onto the property with the existing woodland, not even accounting for the additional landscaping that will be provided. And if you turn your attention to exhibit 30, you will see that this building is actually not visible, maybe with the exception from very small components of its roof line along Glendale Boulevard, and not at all visible from Landham Severn Road, and that was purposeful in design and intent. We had a considerable amount of outreach in this case and would like to thank our consultants in that regard. G's Procter and associates and Mister Creighton provided testimony at the Zhe hearing at pages 37 through 39. And I'll just for your edification, because I'm sure the council has better things to do than scrub through 221 pages of a transcript. But on February 12, 2022, the applicant met with the Glendale Civic association. On June 21, 2022, they presented revised elevations to the Glendale Civic associations in response to comments that the Glendale Civic association provided. On May 16, 2023, there was a follow up meeting with the Glendale Civic association. On September 21, 2023, they met with the director of Happy Home Early Learning center, which is an adjoining property owner. On October 4, 2023, the applicant met with another neighbor joining property owner Amigaal Construction.

This application does conform to the requirements of CB 1120 23. The preapplication neighborhood meeting was held prior to April 1, 2023 and therefore this application was purposefully grandfathered to utilize the zoning warrants prior to the adoption of CB 11 20 23, which now subsequently prohibits this use in the CS zone. However, because the preapplication in meeting occurred before April 1, 2023, this uses this application is grandfathered under those prior provisions and the use is permitted subject to a special exception. Now turning to the special exception and thank you for your indulgence, probably would have been a lot briefer, but with Mister Suhar in the audience, I want to make sure we cover all our bases. Turning to the special exception standards and the burden, I think you may hear from Mister Brown later this morning, but there is no sworn testimony in opposition to this application. There has been no appeal or exceptions of the zoning hearing examiner decision filed in this application. Therefore, there is no allegation of any specific errors claimed to have been committed by the hearing examiner and any attempt to maybe raise those today would be barred as having been waived. There is no evidence of harm or any factors causing disharmony regarding the proposed use at this location. There is no evidence of any adverse impact or harm in the record, let alone, excuse me, let alone any evidence of any adverse impact or harm being above and beyond those inherent with the proposed use, irrespective of its location. The case law as it relates to special exception is very clear and it addresses and acknowledged that there is a presumptive finding that special exception uses conceptually are compatible in the particular zone with otherwise permitted uses and with the surrounding zones and uses already in place in this instance, and with the presumptive fighting in mind. While the opposition, while Mister Suhart, excuse me, may try to focus on adverse impacts, said impacts are inherent and may exist that does not prove fatal. As the legislature has previously examined any inherent impacts of this use and has determined that this use in the CS zone prior to CB 11 20 23 presumptively is compatible with other uses in the CS zone and by placing the property in that zone shares reciprocal benefits, thereby providing for coordinated, adjusted and harmonious development within the county, the zoning district, as well as on the property. There is no evidence again in this record of incompatibility. The development has been found to be in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. To that point, I would just draw your attention to section 27, 3604 E one and 27 5402 U, both of which deal with the required findings for this application. The zoning hearing examiner's decision at pages eight through 19 go through the required findings in 27 3604 E one, as well as the technical staff report at exhibit 17, pages seven through ten, exhibit 39, our land planning report and our exhibit two, which is our justification statement, all of which were incorporated as testimony and adopted into the record. Section 27 5402 U is addressed in the ZHU decision at pages 19 through 21, the technical staff report, exhibit 17, exhibit 39, our land planning report as well as exhibit two or justification statement. Furthermore, part 27 six which are that all the applicable development standards have been met. Pages 21 through 23 of the ZHE decision, as well as the technical staff report, exhibit 17 and exhibit 39. I mentioned before the architecture being unique in this. In this application, it was specifically revised in response to comments we heard from the Glendale Civic association, in particular to its roofline. Miss Rebecca Brown, who's an expert architect, testified at pages 111 through 142 regarding exhibit 30, exhibit 45, which is a neighborhood compatibility exhibit, and exhibit 27, which is the architectural elevations which you saw this morning.

I'm happy to answer any questions. If there's any rebuttal, I'll certainly reserve any time for that as well. Thank you. Okay, Mister Olson? Yeah, thank you. Mister Tedesco. A couple questions you mentioned and I know the elevation drop, you know, it's sort of in a bowl somewhat. Can you discuss the stormwater management of the site? And I don't know if the staff can pull up, you know, anything on the stormwater management of the site because you've got the railroad tracks on one side, Glendale Road, Lanham Severn Road. There's only one direction for the water to go, I think. Yeah, certainly you may have a slide in the PowerPoint presentation that Miss Lockhart provided that shows the location, but the stormwater management, and Emily Dean is here can speak probably a little bit more detailed about it, but we have approved site development concept plan approved by DPI associated with this application. It's good till March of 2026. It proposes an underground facility as well as a submerged gravel wetland to treat both quality and quantity control for the stormwater management. And what year storm is that for? I believe it's a hundred. Yeah, it's 100 year storm, 100 year storm. And all on site. Okay. Yes, all on site. Okay. And tell me again, the access, it goes from Duval Street, I assume? Correct. And so Duval street, part of Duval street, will be improved? It's currently not improved today, right. It'll be improved in the future to the road standard pursuant by DPW and T to a closed section, meaning curb and gutter. There'll be sidewalks added and the other unique thing that I failed to mention. Talking about the architecture, I did focus on the height and how. You are correct, councilmember Olson. The site does sit down in a bowl. And again, we've used that to our advantage with respect to screening. But also the uniqueness of the building is that. And you can see in the architectural, Miss Lockhart indicated the entrance. All vehicular loading or unloading or access into the building are served inside the building. In other words, vehicles travel through the building to access it. So there is no exterior loading or unloading of vehicles. It's all internal to the building. Okay. And then, I mean, it is a pretty isolated site how, in terms of, like, security. And there's two. This two edged sword. Right. So that, you know, lighting, I mean, there is a neighborhood, or, I mean, it's not. Not a lot of homes there, but can you discuss the lighting and security? Yeah, absolutely. And thank you for the question. So, as part of the special exception site plan, and in your record, there is a photometric plan that fully complies with the standards of the new zoning ordinance as far as foot candles and not having any light pollution bleed off of the site immediately to the, I'll call it plan view, kind of southwest is the railroad tracks planned view south? Well, I guess that would be southeast. Southwest is really industrial and commercial, existing businesses. There's a gas station across the street as well as a church, and mostly commercial and industrial uses. No light pollution occurs off site, certainly not on the north or east size as well. But there are, again, the topography to the north is Maryland 193. So obviously the lights are the night sky type lights, so they shine down, they can't go up. So there's no light pollution on the 193 side and certainly none on the Lanham Severn road side, because of the setbacks and the topography and the fact that the lights are designed in such a way that they don't provide that. Regarding your comment regarding security, that's kind of critical to this application. This is a new, modern facility. It's all 100% climate controlled. It's accessible through secured locations, a secured gate. So there's 24/7 surveillance. It's what not only the county and you all, as the district council, pretty much demand of these uses in the 21st century, but also what the patrons of these facilities demand, which is bright, on site, safe accessibility and climate controlled, secure facilities. And all of those things are met here. Is this site accessible for 24 hours a day? Or, I mean, if someone wants to go and pick up something at three in the morning. They can do that. Or it could be. There wouldn't be anybody on site at those times, but everyone would have an access code to access their facilities. But there's a gate. Correct. That prohibits anyone who doesn't have the code to go in there? That's correct. And there'll be security at that gate? Security camera at that gate? Yes, sir. At the gate? Yes, sir.

And then this is a forested site, as I recall. Correct. It has. It actually has been graded and cleared. So the vast majority of the site is cleared, which is what is triggering the off site credits because most of the site has already been graded and cleared through prior entitlements and approval. There's an existing cell tower on the site that will remain. So a lot of that grading occurred with other developments that just never came to fruition. The off site woodland, I think that councilman you're referring to is to be retained and not disturbed. So. I'm sorry. So then, in terms of forest conservation or forest, you know, the planting trees elsewhere. I mean, is that. Was that done by someone else already? Because it was already graded. No, we'll be required. Yeah, we'll be required to acquire off site credits related to it. However, I don't want there to be a misunderstanding. That. That doesn't mean we're not planting trees. We are planting trees. We are meeting or exceeding the landscape manual requirements for tree planting. We're actually exceeding the tree canopy coverage requirement for the site. I think by. I think. I don't have the number in front of me, but I think it's almost 1000 sqft more TCC coverage than what's required. So we are still planning. It's just you can't take credit for all those plantings for woodland conservation, but they do count towards landscape manual compliance as well as TCC compliance. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, madam chair. Any other questions, colleagues? Okay. We will now go to what is listed as the opposition. You have twelve minutes left. I'm assuming that everyone you listed who's. We already have their testimony. You're saying that that is counting, that they're not going to come forward to speak? Not unless there's anything in rebuttal that I would have them come speak to. No, madam chair. All right, thank you. Making sure? Yes. Sean Suhar for the opposition. You have 30 minutes. Good morning. Chair Ivey and members of the district council. My name is Shawn Suhar. I am an attorney with the firm of Nagel and Zaller, and I represent the Wingate homeowners. Association in this matter. And good morning, everyone in attendance of today's hearing. I appreciate having an opportunity to be heard. As you may already know, my firm, Nagel and Zaller, represents several community associations, homeowners associations, condominiums in Prince George's county and in Glendale, such as Wingate Homeowners association and Gabriel's Run homeowners Association. As I mentioned, I'm an attorney admitted to practice law in front of the Supreme Court of Maryland in this matter. I represent the Wingate Homeowners association, incorporated as their attorney. However, if you read the decision that was rendered in this case by the zoning hearing examiner Joyce Nichols, she refused to recognize me as the attorney for Wingate Homeowners association. In fact, the Zona hearing examiner determined that I was there in my, quote, unquote, or my, quote, individual capacity, end quote, and not as a representative of Wingate Homeowners association. The Wingate Homeowners Association Incorporated, is an incorporated homeowners association incorporated under the laws of the state of Maryland. It's a corporate entity, consists of 256 lot owners. These lots of owners are your constituents. The bylaws of the organization permit lot owners to elect a board of directors as the governing body, as a representative body of the association, to represent their interests in a process such as the one we're here for today. I want to review what zoning hearing examiner Nichols said in her decision about my representation, or lack thereof, of the Wingate Homeowners association. Bear with me because I know it's part of the record already. But on page one, under what's entitled nature of proceedings, it says under number two that at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the record was left open for the applicant's certificates of good standing and for Mister Suhart to provide the minutes of the HOA meeting, including the total membership, the number of members present, the vote, and how the meeting was advertised to the total membership, and the motion voted upon, Mister Suhar wrote a letter dated December 1, 2023, indicating that he had been retained by the board of directors, but failed to provide the meeting information required by law. Required by law. The record was closed on December 1, 2023. There is a footnote that goes further on to describe or explain that I'm a member of the bar, that I appeared at the evidentiary hearing but failed to provide minutes of the HOA in which the HOA took a vote to have me appear in a representational capacity. Zoning hearing examiner Nichols determined that the association somehow needed to obtain a vote of the entire membership of 256 lot owners in order to authorize me, as the association's attorney, to represent the association during the heari", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Unnamed Facility", "insights": [{"observation": "It's all 100% climate controlled.

Zoning hearing examiner Nichols determined that the association somehow needed to obtain a vote of the entire membership of 256 lot owners in order to authorize me, as the association's attorney, to represent the association during the hearing. This is egregious. In this country, we allow for representative forms of governance. I'm sure that you all are familiar with this process. Since you represent the citizens of this great county. It is absurd to think that the lot owners would be required to vote on an issue such as this. However, the zoning hearing examiner claims that it is required by law. I ask, what law is she referring to? Even the people's Zoning council. Mister Stan Brown, who was present today, also suggested to the zoning hearing examiner that this is required. However, there is no such requirement. I was reminded by Mister Brown that this is a longstanding tradition and that it's customary to require a vote of the members. However, when I asked for a citation to the law or a rule, none was given. That is because there is no such law. There is no such requirement. The bylaws of the association delegate to the elected board of directors. To manage the business affairs of the association and to control the common areas. The bylaws authorize the board to make all business decisions of the association, except for those which are reserved for the membership. Madam chair, someone is speaking in the background. It's kind of distracting for me. Okay. I can't hear them, but I'm sure people will be quiet now. Go ahead. Thank you very much. So, as I was saying, the bylaws authorize the board to make all business decisions of the association, except for those which are reserved for the membership. From there, the board has authority to appoint committees which serve the interests of the board. I provided the zoning hearing examiner with documentation of the planning and zoning committee's position and determination regarding this matter, which was made during a hearing. However, the zoning hearing examiner chose not to recognize Wingate homeowners association as a party of record. But she recognized me in my individual capacity. Not real sure what kind of weight that she gave. The comments that I gave that during the hearing. But nothing was mentioned about what I said in her analysis, her decision, the report, nothing. I encourage members of the district council to watch the video transcript of the hearing in addition to reading the written transcript. Wingate's board of directors was so disturbed by what happened as a result of this hearing that they quickly adopted a resolution to once again authorize the planning and zoning committee to take positions on planning and zoning matters, and to authorize me to represent them during all planning and zoning hearings such as this was unreasonable. It's unreasonable. I'm sorry. It was unreasonably burdensome and excessively expensive to require the entire 256 lot owners to vote on the zoning issue. This is unfair to the association. In fact, it appears to the board and I that there is an effort to keep us quiet. However, the Wingate Homeowners association cares deeply about issues like this and will continue to voice its concerns. These are existing residents. They care very much about what developments are being proposed and are occurring around their neighborhood. Members of the Wingates board of directors, I'm sorry, members of Wingate's board and many of the law owners work during the daytime hours. Therefore, the board is entitled to have me appear as the association's attorney during planning and zoning hearings to represent the association's interests. Members of the council, please know that members of the board of directors are watching this hearing today remotely and will report to the membership the results of today's hearing. They wanted that. The board members wanted me to convey that one of the most important issues to Wingate is the impact that the proposed adjacent developments will have on the low density residential character of the neighborhood that the association and its members and lot owners have traditionally enjoyed and have invested so much time into. I'll note on pages 19 and 20 of the zoning hearing examiner's decision. She cited the law for a special exception in this case, which is found under sections section 27, 5402 U. Under section 1D, subsection 1D, Little I. The law requires that the district council find that there is a need for the public in the surrounding area, that there's a need for the consolidated storage facility. The zoning hearing examiner said merely that the applicant's submittal included a market study which demonstrates that a public need for this facility exists in the surrounding area. In fact, the applicant has failed to prove that there is a need for a storage facility in the neighborhood. The quote unquote market study merely identifies some existing storage facilities in other neighborhoods which are not to full capacity, and then the applicant uses that claim. I'm sorry, claims that there is a need for storage facilities across the street from Wingate.

The study uses median if you read the study conducted by Valveridge, the study uses median of age and household incomes. Not exactly sure where that is, but it does not specify that it's in the area affecting Wingate or the subject property. And it only states on page two that they have tabulated. That they have not tabulated specific demand, but recognize commercial demand generally based on national trends. This doesn't demonstrate a need for this type of facility in the neighborhood. The subject property is surrounded by large lots with large single family dwellings on them. The lots are mostly zoned. Re and RR individual lots have plenty of storage on their own lots and do not need off site storage. However, the zoning hearing examiner accepted their market study. The study failed to conduct studies in the neighborhood and failed to find that people in the neighborhood need or want storage. However, offsite storage. However, there is no need for offsite storage near Wingate. The neighborhood is completely. I'm sorry. Is currently characterized, in my opinion, as low density development. However, if the storage facility is permitted, we fear that the low density nature of the community will change. We fear that this may attract higher density uses such as apartments and townhomes, which we're not opposed to, but in the right place. This is not the right place for it. It appears that the zoning hearing examiner merely accepted the market study without considering what the market study actually found. In other words, the applicant completed a market study and members of the council, that box was checked. It just. It appears to my client and I that that's just the status quo in this process. That boxes are being checked without questioning the material that's being presented. So in recommending the acceptance of the special approval of the special exception, none of my comments were mentioned or considered. None. Especially my client, the Wingate Homeowners association. I'm sorry. Essentially, my client, the Wingate Homeowners association, was deprived of due process in this matter. This is tragic. Based on this, I recommend that the county council, sitting as the district council, not approve of special exception or require further hearings to consider my client's position. Thank you for your time. And again, I appreciate the opportunity to be heard on this matter. I have a lot of respect for this body. I respect the zoning hearing examiner and the other side's positions, but I just. I wanted the council to know my client, and I wanted the council to know it was important enough to be here this morning to let you know our thoughts on this matter. Thanks again. Mister Tedesco. You would have five minutes to rebut. Thank you, madam Chair. I'll be brief. Thank you, Mister Suhar, for his arguments. We stand behind people's Zoning council's recommendation to the hearing examiner, as well as the hearing examiner's determinations with respect to this case and with respect to the requirements. Opposing counsel, for whatever reason, and I can't tell you why, and I don't think I'm obligated to render a suggestion why, but for whatever reason, Mister Suhar, who is not a novice, is very familiar with the process, very familiar with the proceedings, appears before this body and before the hearing examiner regularly understands and knows that if there's issues with the proposed decision, whether it's from the planning board or whether it's from the zoning hearing examiner, that he has on behalf of his client, the opportunity to request an appeal and file an exceptions and note those exceptions as far as what he alleges the errors are, he failed to do that. He instead decided to come before you this morning and air grievances which you know I can understand and respect, but utterly failed to provide any basis with respect to any exceptions in writing that would have given us an opportunity to respond to it here today. Just hearing it orally, Mister Suhar and his clients received the notice from the zoning hearing examiner, which is a two page notice. It's very clear and articulates what the appeal periods are, what the requirements are, who, when, where, what is to be filed to challenge and allege any exceptions of the hearing examiner that did not occur. Mister Suhar, any case that there's impacts to the character of the neighborhood, but unfortunately, there's absolutely no evidence in the record to support such an argument or a claim. Mister Suhar attempts to argue the fact that need hasn't been met, and really, as we indicated at the hearing, what it comes down to is that his client, or members of his client don't want this use, and not wanting a use and not needing a use based upon the legal standard of need are totally two different things.

It's very clear and articulates what the appeal periods are, what the requirements are, who, when, where, what is to be filed to challenge and allege any exceptions of the hearing examiner that did not occur. Mister Suhar, any case that there's impacts to the character of the neighborhood, but unfortunately, there's absolutely no evidence in the record to support such an argument or a claim. Mister Suhar attempts to argue the fact that need hasn't been met, and really, as we indicated at the hearing, what it comes down to is that his client, or members of his client don't want this use, and not wanting a use and not needing a use based upon the legal standard of need are totally two different things. Again, there is no evidence in this record as it relates to anything that would support Mister Suhar's arguments, any factual findings that would support his arguments with respect to need not being met. In fact, it has been met as evidenced by a voluminous record with transcripts, both oral and written findings. Mister Suhart indicates that the surrounding neighborhood is large lot subdivisions. You just need to look at the area. I think Mister Olson, who indicated he knows this property well, understands that that's just factually not correct. The Wingate Homers association is actually not even part of the neighborhood that's been designated for this special exception. While I can understand that everyone believes that there are certain uses in certain locations that are better fitting or would be more compatible, the reality is, as I mentioned in my opening, is that there is a presumptive finding. And while the opposition may try to focus on any impacts in this case, the impact being it's not consistent with the neighborhood. Although his clients properties are outside the geographical neighborhood of this application, that does not prove fatal. As the legislation, legislature, you all have already previously examined any inherent impacts and have determined that the use in this zone is presumptively compatible. Again, there is no evidence in the record of incompatibility. Despite Mister Suhar's arguments, the development has been found to be in accordance with all the applicable regulations. Turning to need again, I would cite you to exhibit five transcripts 143 to 182. Not all of the facilities in the area are modern, contactless and 100% climate control that went into the determination of need. Industry trends were discussed in great length. Increased demand was discussed at great length. Testimony provided this facility will have a modern architectural 24/7 surveillance code, activated gates, climate controlled units covered in heated loading areas internal to the building. The evidence that's supported, that's uncontroverted, provides and supports a finding that this use meets the need requirement being reasonably convenient to serve the area, not just Mister Suhart's clients. And as far as being deprived of due process, we would object to that as well. Again, Mister Suhart failed to provide any written basis or appeal or exceptions in this case. No due process issues are. No due process violations are at issue here. I respectfully think that that's just a red herring to get the attention of the political body. But no due process violations occurred in this case. And finally, and just in closing, thank you very much. And one comment from Mister Dunogo. Before we go to the opposition's response, two comments. One, I'd like clarification from our attorney, Mister Kumar. I take issue with Mister Dunesco's point that the opposition, or any opposition, cannot raise issues when the council is called to matter up. When the council is called the matter up, pretty much everything is on the ground. So I would take issue with that. Mister Kumar could correct me if I'm incorrect. Then I have another comment. You're not incorrect, Mister Dunoga. The case is Billings versus Prince George's County 420 Maryland 84 2011. The case was decided on June 20 of 2011, where it was a special exception case from Prince George's county. And the court opined that once the district council elects to review a case, no party below is required to file exceptions. And they may appear at the oral argument and raise any question, any argument or question, so long as it's based on the record. Thank you. Now, I don't have a comment on the merits of the case, but over my almost 40 years doing this type of stuff, I've appeared in front of many bodies, including this body, as a citizen association leader, as an individual, and as an attorney for citizen associations. And when I read the first page of the hearing examiner's decision, the short version is, Mister Suhar is correct. And the hearing examiner has conflated several things. And as a novice 35 years ago, I was tripped up myself on these types of issues. The state law provides a relaxation of the rule that a corporation, an HOA, a civic association, a corporation, has to be represented by an attorney. So the state law, which is incorporated into the prior zoning ordinance for authorized representatives, says that a community leader who's been authorized, even though they're not an attorney, can appear on behalf of the entity. So it's relaxation. It says nothing about what an attorney has to do. Mister Suhar said that he challenged this question of whether or not he had to provide certain information. That was county law. As it says in the hearing examiner's decision, there is no such law. What has existed, and I said, what tripped me up over the years is that it's very wise for the applicant's attorney to challenge civic association leaders who appear to talk. Did you have a meeting? Who showed up at the meeting? Was this representative of the body of the entity, the civic association, the HOA. And they do that to undermine the credibility of the civic association. Now the flip side of that is you don't want Joe Smith, who has a civic assoc", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Unnamed Development Company", "insights": [{"observation": "The facility will have a modern architectural design, 24/7 surveillance, code-activated gates, climate-controlled units, and covered and heated loading areas internal to the building.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Unnamed Opposing Party (Mister Suhar's Clients)", "insights": [{"observation": "Mister Suhar argues there are impacts to the character of the neighborhood, but there is no evidence in the record to support such a claim.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "No due process violations were identified.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Unnamed Development Company", "insights": [{"observation": "The facility will have a modern architectural design, 24/7 surveillance, code-activated gates, climate-controlled units, and covered and heated loading areas internal to the building.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Unnamed Opposing Party (Mister Suhar's Clients)", "insights": [{"observation": "Mister Suhar argues there are impacts to the character of the neighborhood, but there is no evidence in the record to support such a claim.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "No due process violations were identified.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 2552654, "chunk_end_time": 2971702, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3461?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3461?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=2552"}, {"start": 39000, "end": 45000, "text": "ion, has to be represented by an attorney.

Now the flip side of that is you don't want Joe Smith, who has a civic association, of one, showing up and saying, I represent a lot of people. So there's reasons for this, but it's not a law. It's something that's typical of the zoning bar to ask, and it's not inappropriate. And if you're a wise or experienced citizen association leader, you know this. But that has nothing to do with the representation rights of the attorney of the entity. So when I look at what Miss Nichols wrote, I don't understand where she's coming from. I think it's clearly prejudicial. And I read the transcript that we have in front of us, and it just seemed like there was an effort all around to keep the citizens from having a voice. So I have no comment on the merits. It seems like the applicant has done a good job on the merits, but from a procedural standpoint, even if we move forward on this case and approve it, this is a very bad message that was sent. And literally, it's a message that I've been getting as a citizen for almost 40 years. So I'm just disturbed by the context and the text of the zoning hearing examiner's decision. That's my comment, madam chair. Well, this is Mister Suhar's five minutes. Is it still necessary for you to speak, sir, since your attorney's already spoken for you, or would you like to speak for your five minutes. I just have one comment. It won't take long. Madam chair, if I may. Thank you. I just wanted to say thank you to councilmember Durnoga. I agree with your comments. I have nothing to add there. But I do have one point of contention with what Mister Tedesco said on rebuttal. And that is this what appears to be his argument that my client, or me in this case, because according to the zoning hearing examiner, was somehow obligated to present evidence in the record of their not being sufficient need. If I go back to the statute, I don't find that the opposition there is required to produce such evidence. In fact, the burden is on the applicant to prove that there is sufficient need. That there is a need. And so the evidence, which is already in the record, it's the market study. I suggest, strongly suggest, that the district council take a look at that market study. Because even Mister Tedesco said that it was based on national trends. Market trends. Quite frankly, I don't care about market trends nationally. What I care about is what's happening here in Prince George's county. What my client cares about is what is happening here in Wingate. I think that it's also interesting that Mister Tedesco is very happy to point out that Wingate is not in the district four, across the street from my client's property. The subject property is very much. It is located caddy corner to the Wingate Homeowners association. In fact, you can see it from homes, from lots you can see the subject property. This very much impacts it's going to have. If this is approved, this will have a detrimental impact upon the existing residents. The existing lots, the existing neighborhood, Wingate Homeowners association, and other neighborhoods that are also comprised of large one to two acre lots with large single family homes. Thank you very much for an opportunity to make additional comments. Okay, we will now go to Stan Brown, the people's zoning council. Good morning, madam chair. I guess there are two issues in this case given what has been argued by Mister Suhar and Mister Tedesco. And the first issue is the one that's been cited by Mister Dunoga concerning Mister Suhar's legal representation of the Wingate association. And the second issue will be the condition two that the examiner recommends in her approval for this condition. I'm sorry. One b. To clarify the issue concerning Mister Suhart's representation, Mister Dunoga is correct on the law and he is correct on the issue of having been conflated as to whether this is an issue of Mister Suhar's legal authority to represent a community organization versus his obligation if he's going to advocate for his client. Well, to put facts in the record concerning his representation. The applicant, or rather the examiner, was not challenging Mister Suhar's authority as an attorney in the state of Maryland to represent the Wingate civic association. What she was attempting to do was what Mister Dunoga had suggested. And that is, it is common practice for myself to examine the civic association on what were the parameters of your opposition or your support? And the reason for that is in this case, you have 250 members of the homeowners association. On occasion, what has occurred is five people show up and hire an attorney and they are opposed to an application or the converse. Five people show up at the behest of the applicant and they are in support of the application. I then ask, well, was a meeting convened? How many people were at the meeting? Was there a committee of the HOA? And the reason for that is, we want to know from an evidentiary, from a factual standpoint, does the formal HOA support or oppose the application?

Was there a committee of the HOA? And the reason for that is, we want to know from an evidentiary, from a factual standpoint, does the formal HOA support or oppose the application? That is what was being requested of Mister Suhar. Not a letter indicating that you as a member of the bar have represented, that you represent Wingate, but evidence, facts that the association met, took a vote. There were members present, the quantity of those members, and that they are opposed to this application. That is what was being requested. That's reasonable. Mister Dunoga accurately cited why that is done. It benefits both the applicant and the opposition so that we know formally what the position of the association is. So the problem that then arises when Mister Suhar essentially refused to present any facts, any evidence from his client. Basically, all of Mister Suhart's comments before the examiner amounts to argument, not facts, not evidence. As counsel, he made argument. He did not put a letter in the record that says Wingate is opposed. He did not proffer a witness to testify that Wingate is opposed. So there's no documentary evidence, there's no testimonial evidence, just his argument of what he concludes are alleged facts. He represents the association. That's a given. But there are no facts that say they are opposed. And so that is what was being requested. What were the facts? Not your representation or your argument of those facts. So Mister Suhar did not file an exception. Mister Dunoga? You're correct. He's not required to file an exception. And having appeared on behalf of a party of record, he correctly can make argument here today. He's made argument today, but he's not submitting any evidence because he didn't submit any evidence before the examiner. And so my assumption is the examiner did not make any reference to anything you said before the examiner, Mister Suhar, is because you didn't give any evidence. You merely made argument on what other facts were in the record. So the issue of representation. You represent the Wingate homeowner's association, Mister Suhart, but you didn't put any evidence in the record to support your position. Yes, you may cross examine, and you did cross examine the applicant and their witnesses to challenge the issue of need and any other requirements of the purposes of the special exception and what have you, and that can be considered by this body. But again, that's mere argument and challenging facts that were put in the record by the applicant. The other issue in this case is that this council passed a bill, I think it was CB 1123, but it may not have been that number, but passed a bill that basically allowed consolidated storage under the new zoning ordinance to proceed under certain additional conditions related to a special exception. And one of those conditions appears on page 20 of the examiner's decision. And basically it says in the CS zone, excuse me, the property owner shall set aside a minimum of 1500 gross floor area of commercial retail office space at ground level or above ground level at zero base rent to be leased as business incubator or community nonprofit space as defined in section 27, 2500. And then it has three parenthetical subsets of that condition. The property owner shall ensure that the community nonprofit tenant has access to at least one large storage unit on the property. And so, based upon that requirement, the examiner then adds a condition, one b, that provides, prior to the issuance of the first building permit, the applicant shall provide a signed community benefit agreement in accordance with section 275402 of the Prince George County Code. It's my position that that bill is invalid with regards to that particular section, and it would be improper, I believe, for this council to require a property owner to contribute a portion of their property to a third party, in this case a nonprofit, that's unrelated to the property itself. This requirement has no relationship to the zoning function of the county. That is the general health, safety, and welfare as it relates to this particular special exception. What we are doing here is we're basically taking a property owner's property and saying, look, if you want a consolidated storage, you got to give 1500 nonprofit and you shall also give them one storage unit. I mean, that would be equivalent to, let's say, an application for a car dealership and the car dealership yeah, you can be approved for this car dealership, but you've got to give an automobile to the local nonprofit and you got to let them park it in your garage. You know, it would be equivalent to a fast food restaurant. You know, yes, you can have this fast food restaurant special exception, but you've got to give percentage of your sales to the homeless. That may be a good thing to do, but you're taking property right from this property owner that has no relationship to the approval of the special exception whatsoever. And it's inappropriate. And so I believe this section I is an unconstitutional infringement on this applicants and all consolidated storage property rights. Now, it is the law. It has not been challenged by anyone. So, yes,", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Wingate Civic Association", "insights": [{"observation": "Mister Suhar, representing the Wingate Civic Association, did not provide documentary or testimonial evidence during a hearing, only arguments.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The council passed a bill requiring consolidated storage properties to allocate 1500 gross floor area of commercial retail office space at zero base rent for business incubator or community nonprofit space.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Wingate Civic Association", "insights": [{"observation": "Mister Suhar, representing the Wingate Civic Association, did not provide documentary or testimonial evidence during a hearing, only arguments.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The council passed a bill requiring consolidated storage properties to allocate 1500 gross floor area of commercial retail office space at zero base rent for business incubator or community nonprofit space.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 3335022, "chunk_end_time": 3815900, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3461?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3461?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=3335"}, {"start": 49000, "end": 55000, "text": "r's property and saying, look, if you want a consolidated storage, you got to give 1500 nonprofit and you shall also give them one storage unit.

And so I believe this section I is an unconstitutional infringement on this applicants and all consolidated storage property rights. Now, it is the law. It has not been challenged by anyone. So, yes, you know, it's the law. But if it is challenged, I believe that it would be invalidated. My recommendation would be, and again, I understand this council passed this bill, but my recommendation would be that this condition one be. Be deleted because it's based upon what I consider to be an unconstitutional section of the new zoning ordinance related to consolidated storage. I have no further questions. I mean, comments. Okay, Mister Hawkins, thank you, Mister Brown, for your comments. You also mentioned gave a brief assessment up in the briefing your position. After you said that, I asked our attorneys how did we get to this point? And they disagreed with your position. Mister Kumar, what is your position on what Mister Brown just stated? I was hoping Karen Shovakis would be here, because based on what Mister Brown said. Sounds logical, but I'm not an attorney, so where are you on this? Thank you, councilmember Hawkins. Under Maryland law, if someone wants to challenge a legislative action by the council, they have 30 days to do so. It's my understanding this bill was passed last year and the time has passed to do so. With regard to the substantive argument that Mister Brown is making, our suggestion is unconstitutional. Constitutional. Only a court of competent jurisdiction can make that finding. And Mister Brown is correct because the bill has not been challenged. It is a valid law in the ordinance. Mister Wachers, you want to add or did Mister Kumar do an accurate job responding? Mister. Thank you, Councilmember Hawkins. Yes, Mister Kumar did respond to the issue at hand. As the drafter of CB 1120 23, I can offer that. I don't think I can agree with Mister Brown's assessment as to the unconstitutional assessment for the provision of space. So we'll have to leave it there. It was discussed during the committee process and vetted thoroughly. And we were comfortable at that time in advising the council that it was a legally valid enactment. So there we are. We have a couple of questions coming on this issue, Mister Brown. I will just throw mine in there real quick, since this was my bill. I never heard anything from you about this until today. So what motivated you today to raise this issue? And not for the year prior when it was already in effect, or during the time we were debating the bill. No, actually, when this bill was debated, I did make these comments to various stakeholders that were pushing this bill forward. I communicated that to many of the property owners who wanted consolidated storage. Did not testify at the committee hearing. And the reason for that really is simple. When I participate in the drafting of the legislation, then I cannot really be independent and objective on my comments on the legislation. Because essentially I become vested in a particular position. And so that's why it's really not necessary for people's own and council to participate in every committee hearing and give a particular position on the bill. But I have communicated several times when this bill was being drafted. That that particular provision I thought was improper. Well, I can tell you that I've had zero complaints from any property owner who's affected. In fact, they were delighted to be able to embrace this provision. So I'm sure it's because they wanted to do more to help the community. And you had some great ideas for bills. But I don't think I'll put them in. Council member Oriata. Thank you, chair Ivy and I just want to echo your comments. As someone that also worked with the chair, I never heard any opposition. I'm hearing you didn't. So I'm just not sure what members you did speak to. But it wasn't the lead sponsor or me as a co sponsor on the legislation. And just because this argument's being made for my clarity. As I was trying to follow the testimony today. Are you saying that. So this business does not want to do that. And it's not in their draft proposal. Just so I have clarity. And again, I want to be clear. I stated Mister Kumar and Mister Cevacus agreed. The bill is law today. No one has challenged it, so it's law. I believe the applicant is willing to comply with what is an existing law today. My position merely is, Miss O'Rida. That I think the bill, if challenged, would be struck down. But that doesn't mean that you cannot approve this application. If that's what your intent is. And I believe this applicant will attempt to comply with it. I guess I'm still not following. So is it currently in the address in the application or. It's not currently because I guess I'm not understanding the why this came up if it is in the application. So it is in the application. It's part of the law today, and the examiner included it in her analysis and attached a condition to comply with it. So yes, it's part of the application.

I wasn't going to touch on this issue, but I think that Mister Brown has an obligation to raise the point. And the Supreme Court last month considered sheets versus county of El Dorado. So we'll probably hear more on this in the near future and maybe in a way that we don't like, and being in a question of constitutionality, it can be raised at any time. I think the 30 day issue will not save us if somebody wants to challenge us. But I want to just touch real briefly on something Mister Brown said about the earlier issue with Mister Suhar and not about Mister Suhar himself. We know that zoning by plebiscite is not allowed. We cannot have citizens getting petitions and submitting them. That's not allowed. How many people are on your side is not an issue. At the same time, we allow applicants to question civic associations and hoas as to how many people showed up to support something. It seems just inconsistent that we do that. Plebiscite is plebiscite. But I faced this the very first time I ever walked into a zoning hearing. Who do you represent? Who was at the meeting? Maybe we need to rethink about whether that's appropriate questioning. I'll leave it at that. Thank you, madam chair. Okay, I believe that that is it, and I will now turn to councilmember Watson for direction. Madam chair, I'd like to take it under advisement. Okay, thank you so much.

Good morning, everyone. This is the planning, housing economic development committee. What's today? Today is Thursday, May 16. We have a pretty full agenda, but not as full as it was. So the presentation by the farm bureau has been put off until maybe September. Okay. And we're still waiting to hear from the building industry about them coming in front of us. Okay, so on the agenda, we've got three bills. We will move on CB two as an accommodation to the sponsor and the administration, and then we'll do the presentation from park and planning and CB 31 we'll deal with at the end, but we're just going to move that to June 3. So that's the game plan. So if we could move on to CB two. Yes. Good morning, Chairman Dunoga and members of the committee. We have a proposed draft two and an amendment sheet that is attached. CB two is the bill that amends the housing code to add email by written consent as a method of service for notices of violations, civil citations, and administrative citations. The bill also provides guidelines for implementation of the email methods of service. A copy of CB 220 24, proposed draft two can be found on pages 498 through 506 of your virtual binder. There's also an amendment sheet, as I mentioned before on page 507. I can turn to miss Kathy Cannon to go over the amendments, if that's possible, and then we'll turn to the administration. Thank you, sir. This is CB 220 24, proposed draft two. As Rena had indicated, there are six amendments. Three amendments are amendments offered by DPI and are found in proposed draft two. Three amendments are amendments proposed by chair Donoga and are found in the amendment sheet. Amendment number one is substantive and deals with method of service. It provides that if me mail consent is provided, then service by certified mail or first class mail is not required. Failure to update the department with a new email is not a basis to challenge service and failure to update an email address shall preclude them from any notice related defenses. Amendment number two as substantive and deals with license applications. It requires that license applications shall provide that the licensee is obligated to maintain an updated email address and if email consent is provided, then service by certified mail or first class mail is not required. Failure to update the department with a new email address is not a basis to challenge service and shall preclude them from any notice related defenses. Amendment number three is subjective and deals with license application renewals. It provides that the renewal license application shall provide for the placement of the optional signature of an applicant for service by email. It provides that the renewal license application shall provide that the licensee is obligated to maintain an updated email address. Further, it provides that if email consent is provided, then service by a certified mail or first class mail is not required. Failure to update the department with any new email address is not a basis to challenge service and shall preclude them from any notice related defenses. Now, turning to chair Donegas amendment sheet, chair Donoga's amendments are technical. Each of the three amendments are identical and amend the three amendments just noted, namely method of service, license application, and license renewal. The amendments say strike the term them and substitute the applicant in each instance. And it strikes the term notice related and substitute the term notice hyphen related with a hyphen in each instance. Those are a summary of the six amendments. Thank you, Miss Canning. I'll turn Miss Skinner. Thank you, mister chair. And good morning. The administration wants to thank the sponsor of this legislation and bringing it forward, councilmember Fisher. We do have Lori Parrish. She's the senior advisor to DeFi, here to go over those amendments and to answer any questions. Okay. Actually, I went out of step. I really should let Miss Fisher address the bill for us. I apologize. Well, thank you, mister chair. Thank you, colleagues. I really hope to gain your support on this bill. It really just stemmed from property owners getting notice of violations in a more timely fashion than maybe waiting on getting a physical notice that you have a ticket.

Okay, so next on our agenda is the parking plan presentation on the plan 2035 implementation, part two. Miss Hightower want to orient us. Good morning again, chair. We are going to have Mister Tony Felts and Miss Katina Shulers from the planning department provide you with a briefing. Mister Felton is the division chief for the community planning Division, and Miss Shulers is the division chief for county wide planning. Thank you. So good morning, chair Danoga. Vice chair Ivey, members of the planning, housing, and economic development committee. My name is Tony Felts again, and I am the chief of community planning with the Prince George's County Planning Department, joined today again by Katina scholars, chief of countywide planning, Lakeisha Hull, director of the planning department, and Derek Berlaj, deputy director and other members of our team. Today, we'll take a look at managing growth outside of the centers and outside of the beltway. And as a reminder, this is the third and final part of our Plan 2035 briefing series with your committee. So before beginning, we wanted to give you a quick reminder of residential growth goals in Plan 2035, established by the council in 2014. The goal is for 50% of all new dwelling units built in the county to be built in one of the eight regional transit districts, Greenbelt Metro, College Park Metro, Hyattsville Crossing, New Carrollton Metro, Largo Town Center, Suitland Metro Branch, Avenue Metro, and National harbor. The remaining 25% in local centers, which are focal points of residential development and limited commercial development, 24% in established communities. Those are those suburban areas of the county that were built up and already developed at the time of the adoption of Plan 2035 and no more than 1% in the county's rural and agricultural areas. And as a reminder, the planning department is focused on four areas for implementation of Plan 2035. Right size zoning, incentives for incentive development, managing growth outside the centers, and providing housing for all. We spoke in depth about in center development and housing for all when we last met on April 4, but we wanted to remind you that we've already had some great success stories in Prince George's county within center development. And that's really thanks to good master planning areas like new Carrollton Metro and College Park Metro, where transit oriented mixed youth growth is actively occurring. Master planning is just as important to achieving success outside of the centers as inside our centers. And in our briefing today, we're going to focus on right size zoning and tools to help manage growth outside the centers and the Beltway. So we begin by talking about zoning, and as you know, zoning is the source from where approvals for new development come. Without proper zoning and regulations in place, the county cannot effectively manage growth. And as you know, zoning itself stems from plan 2035 and the master and sector plans that complement it is important to ensure that all areas of the county are properly zoned to meet plan 2035 goals. You may be thinking to yourself, really, didn't we do that with the countywide map amendment in 2021? So it's important to remind you that the countywide map amendment focused on rezoning of the centers, but did not necessarily look at rezoning of any non center properties to correspond to plan 2035, rather to place them in zoning districts that were associated with the new zoning ordinance itself. So that part of the CMA was based on a formula, things like size of the parcel and previous zoning designation from the prior zoning ordinance.

So that part of the CMA was based on a formula, things like size of the parcel and previous zoning designation from the prior zoning ordinance. The effort that we mentioned today will be to ensure the zoning and properties countywide are consistent with plan 2035. And that's part of the reason why the planning department is proposing to fund and fully evaluate the county's 38 master and sector plans to see what's working, what isn't working, and what is and is not appropriate and complimentary to plan 2035. Because, as you know, many of our plans that we have were adopted prior to plan 2035. We anticipate that this review will lead to opportunities to initiate plan amendments and possible zoning changes to right size zoning in the county and ensure the proper zoning designations are in place on a plan by plan level. Right sizing the zoning in areas may mean down zoning of inappropriately zoned properties in some areas. As zoning is critical to the success of your plan 2035 goals, the master plan evaluation will also be utilized to further define the departments six year work program and so while zoning is a key part of the equation, it's really not the only factor. As you know, the planning department is committed to keeping areas outside centers and outside the beltways, as well as inside our centers and inside the Beltway quality neighborhoods and economically vibrant communities. The tools in our toolbox include planning assistance to municipalities and communities program, which you may know as PAMC, which has completed tourism and cultural heritage inventories in Akakee and Ocuaso, as well as sidewalk and streetscape improvements in Brandywine, just to name a few. The PAMC program is currently working on a rails to trails feasibility study for the Chesapeake Bay railway segment and Upper Marlboro, and these types of studies can lead to grants and development programs to maintain community integrity. Additionally, the placemaking program will continue its efforts to enhance and improve underutilized spaces both inside and outside the beltway. The place making team is currently working with organizations like Fort Washington forward for a placemaking enhancement project later this year. Additionally, the master plan of transportation update that is being drafted by the countywide planning team with assistance from community planning will provide additional guidance related to future future growth and mobility in all areas of the county. And these are just some of our planning tools. And I'm going to turn the presentation over to Katina Schoelers for a look at additional tools in our toolbox. Good morning chair Donega, vice chair Ivey and members of the committee. My name is Katina Schoelers. Apart from zoning and the tools Tony mentioned, council is encouraged to consider implementation strategies from other county policy, those, specifically those with benefits from the environmental, agricultural and historic resources of the county. And I'll go through a few first is the draft climate action plan. What's happening right now is the Department of Environment has been actively working on developing implementation strategies to align with the climate actions plan's recommendations. And then there's the resource conservation functional Master plan, a tool to guide future development activities while meeting the county's environmental, agricultural and rural character goals. This includes strategies for establishing more ecological corridors, preserving existing corridors, promoting land conservation, utilizing water quality best practices, and creating more green jobs. Several of these recommendations are being implemented through the development review, mandatory referral, tree canopy and stormwater management processes. However, there are implementation strategies that necessitate coordination between agencies, stakeholders and nonprofits to ensure other goals of the plans are achieved. Next is expanding and promoting the benefits of land preservation programs. This includes the Maryland Agriculture and Land Preservation foundation and the historic, referred to as mouth, and the Historic Agricultural Research Preservation program, referred to as Harp. And then there is the county can capitalize on the state's rural legacy program, also intended to preserve large tracts of land for natural resource and agricultural protections. Nexus continues to promote and increase agricultural activity in the agriculture and rural policy area with focus on environmental, economic and health benefits of having agricultural uses close to where people live and work. And last, land acquisition. The Department of Parks and Recreation has a robust land acquisition program for the purposes of creating recreational parks and facilities, meeting open space, and preserving land. Next slide and now I'll move on to another item we are actively working on. One of the expectations of this briefing was to inform of recommendations on changes to level of service standards and meeting those standards to address growth outside centers. However, such recommendations cannot easily be made without additional research.

Next slide and now I'll move on to another item we are actively working on. One of the expectations of this briefing was to inform of recommendations on changes to level of service standards and meeting those standards to address growth outside centers. However, such recommendations cannot easily be made without additional research. The purpose of adequacy and establishing level of service is to ensure that public services are available or with certainty, will be available to service the new development. It is well understood that with new development comes additional costs that the county will be incurred by the county to service that added growth. Therefore, it would be premature of staff to recommend changes to level of service or changes to methods to meet adequacy until there is a better understanding of the impact growth has had on public services and the sources of those impacts. Before making informed recommendations, more data needs to be collected, more collaboration with agencies needs to be conducted, and an understanding of how much it's costing the county for existing and future growth is critical. How much will it cost the county in ten years and in 20 years if growth outside the centers is not slowed or does it need to be slowed? Is continued growth in these areas good for the county or not? What are the burdens and the challenges on infrastructure and what have been the benefits? Beginning this summer, staff will initiate a study to learn more about how growth has fiscally impacted the county and the projected fiscal impacts of growth. Also, it will inform of the fiscal outcomes of different types of development. Other questions to be addressed is APFO fairly accounting for impacts associated with development? What development types are fiscally more productive? What are the projected operational costs and revenues of different types of development? Are the revenues generated by development sufficient to cover the operating and capital improvement costs for services provided by the county? It may inform us to consider reevaluating adequate public facilities. Staff envisions that the study will encourage further policy discussions on smart growth and more. So how much more growth does the county want or need and exactly where it should go? The study may inquire a second phase that takes a deeper dive into the current ApFo related policies and regulations. It will take at least a year and we hope to return with a briefing to provide an overview of the findings. Next slide. In the interim, council is encouraged to engage with other partners as it takes all resources to meet plan 2035 goals and staff encourages staff will continue public engagement and strengthening of our coordination and partnerships with other agencies. We'll continue to ensure work is being done to meet the goals while being responsive to those who live and work here. That concludes our presentation and we are happy to answer questions. Thank you. Questions. Miss Fisher, you're up. Thank you so much for this presentation. I feel like I guess star because I never come to Phad, so this is cool. I just really want to understand sort of. Well, especially my district is super urban, so that's just, that's just it. When my residents get mad, I'm just like, you live in district two, so that's just what it is. But how do you all are looking at us in a not a project by project view, but amass you in the fact that we're a suburban urban jurisdiction next to not only a major city in the United States, a major city of the world globally. And when you say, well, what does Prince Rogers want in growth? What does it want? But it's. We're not the only ones deciding the factor of, like, how we grow, right? It's the market. And so I'm just, I guess I'm just wondering, how do you all base that? Do you compare our infrastructure matching up with buildings to DC, to other major cities? And just how does that actually, how does that actually come out in the plan? And I think when you're balancing, we can have a plan of what we want versus, like, the regional demand is basically my question. Well, I think you bring up a couple of good points, councilwoman. You know, we take our cues from plan 2035, and it really does recognize that there's not a one size fits all approach for the entire county because just like you said, the entire county is diverse. We've got super urban districts like district two, you know, that are really tight, really urban, have a lot of transportation infrastructure like the metro lines. But then we have other districts like District nine, where I live in, that's mostly rural. You don't have a lot of urban development in district nine. And plus it's, you know, has a lot of our rural and ag area in the county. And we understand that maybe what works well in District 2 may not work so well in District nine. So we don't want to take a one size fits all approach that's why we look at driving more development around our regional transit districts where we have the infrastructure in place. And if you look at what's been done regionally, like in Montgomery county or, you know, across the river in Virginia, they've really capitalized on that regional transit infrastructure and concentrated a lot of the most urban and dense development around those areas. And that's what we're trying to do in", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Nexus", "insights": [{"observation": "Nexus continues to promote and increase agricultural activity in the agriculture and rural policy area with focus on environmental, economic and health benefits of having agricultural uses close to where people live and work.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Department of Parks and Recreation", "insights": [{"observation": "The Department of Parks and Recreation has a robust land acquisition program for the purposes of creating recreational parks and facilities, meeting open space, and preserving land.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Nexus", "insights": [{"observation": "Nexus continues to promote and increase agricultural activity in the agriculture and rural policy area with focus on environmental, economic and health benefits of having agricultural uses close to where people live and work.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Department of Parks and Recreation", "insights": [{"observation": "The Department of Parks and Recreation has a robust land acquisition program for the purposes of creating recreational parks and facilities, meeting open space, and preserving land.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 977510, "chunk_end_time": 1359946, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3567?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3567?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=977"}, {"start": 19000, "end": 25000, "text": "ntire county is diverse.

And if you look at what's been done regionally, like in Montgomery county or, you know, across the river in Virginia, they've really capitalized on that regional transit infrastructure and concentrated a lot of the most urban and dense development around those areas. And that's what we're trying to do in Prince George's county, is capitalize on our transportation infrastructure that we have in places like District two and in places like District one and other districts where we have the transportation infrastructure. That's why we're working on a new plan for the blue Line corridor, so we can make sure areas like Capitol Heights and see Pleasant and Morgan Boulevard, we're capitalizing on that transportation infrastructure. But what we also want to do is, is make sure that we're effectively managing the growth outside of the beltway and outside of those centers where we don't have the infrastructure in place and where we believe it's really expensive for the county to provide and maintain that infrastructure. And so that's kind of what we're talking about today, I guess. I would like to see more, like, actual financial numbers and data on that actual cost. Something I talk about all the time is all of the land, for example, around metro, they gave up the crappiest land. Right. So if you want to do transit development, well, we're constantly in a floodplain. So how are you going to financially subsidize the market for building density in our transit areas when the land structure you already have is four times the cost than building some somewhere else? And then how do you banish the taste level? I want to live in Prince George's county, but I want a backyard, and I don't want to deal with all the crazy neighbors Juanita deals with and all that. I kind of do want to live out there in an affordable house. Like, how do you balance that? And is it truly, what's the cost? What are you going to do to make it cost effective, to make transit development real? Well, I'm glad that you brought that up, because we're doing just that. I think we just put the RFP out. Is that right, Katina? Yeah. We expect us to start this fiscal analysis in the summertime and probably late June, and so we're going to be looking at each of those aspects that you actually just mentioned. And once we have that physical impact analysis, I think that's going to drive further some of the conversation on what we can do to continue driving development to our regional transit districts. But, you know, you kind of hit the nail on the head. There are people that, you know, and I'm one of them, that still likes to live in a more rural or suburban part of the county and, you know, enjoy things like a backyard and a little bit more space. But we do understand that, you know, what's right for me may not be right for you or someone else. And we want to make sure that people have housing options within the county to fit their needs, whatever their needs may be. Thank you, Miss Fisher. Oh, go right ahead. Okay. Well, talking about inside the Beltway, one thing that I do want us to keep in mind is to the extent that we do keep saying inside the beltway and around metros. And you, you know, Miss Fisher already addressed my issue about floodplains by the metro, so I won't bring that up. But we know how important trees are to keeping the air clean and dealing with, you know, water issues. And one thing that I don't want us to do is end up with a situation with children who live inside the Beltway, suffer with dirty air because we're so focused on making sure that we just build inside the Beltway and we have to build. I mean, the reality is the area is growing. We have to provide more housing. When you have more housing, although you say you live in a nice suburban area, I bet you like to go to a restaurant from time to time and you'll start screaming, but we don't have a restaurant, we don't have a grocery store. I absolutely love going to a restaurant, in case you can tell. So when people, once they move out to these less populated areas, they still end up wanting all the things, which, you know, that's just reality. They still want all the things, all the amenities. But I just don't want to end up being so overbuilt inside the Beltway, which we certainly aren't around our metros, that we take away the trees that should be keeping the air clean and for our residents and keeping the stormwater issues at bay. So that's just the thing I want us to keep in mind, too. I'll just say to that I 150% understand, and I think we are, we have, and thank you, council, for adopting cb 2024, because we are certainly making strides to get closer to that tree canopy is just as important as forest cover. I support your position, but what I would note is the focus is on centers inside the Beltway. And unfortunately, we see too much greenfield development inside the Beltway, which I think these are problems. And the amount of tree coverage that's supposed to be saved is frankly not very much anywhere. And it's even less inside the Beltway, which makes Greenfield development inside the Beltway problematic. But this council has been very willing to support those developments. So in some respect, we are the problem. Mister Hawkins had a question. Thank you Mister chair.

I had an opportunity to sit on a climate action plan committee. Oftentimes when I'm out in the community, I'm asked, what's the delay? Where are we? Climate action planning. You spoke on it earlier. Is it any further information ivory, you can share about the citizens who are interested in or maybe listening? I don't have any. I mean we have. We do have representatives on the committee for the implementation task force. They're working on strategies to implement those 26 or 27 recommendations of the plan. I think there was some time ago they brought those before you to show you what those were. There are two or three recommendations they have not completed implementation strategies on. So I think once they get that out the way. But I will. I cannot speak for Department of Environment, so I would recommend they come and give you that update. You good? Mister Hawkins, Mister Franklin has his hand up. Mister Franklin. Thank you Mister chair. And thank you to our partners at park and planning for the presentation. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend the last briefing where you talked about encouraging development in our transit areas and our centers. You proposed, I believe, when it comes to our transit areas, ending call up and district review of site plans, I believe you proposed in those areas. I think that was, that's definitely on the right track. That's not going to surprise my colleagues. I think ultimately we don't talk enough about the factor of return on investment when it comes to what drives development decisions and the extent to which we want to see development occur of a certain type in a certain area, particularly neurotrans stations. Those are some of the areas where return on investment is very difficult. And so if we want to, and we're serious about making that a priority, we need to remove the obstacles and create more incentives, both in our development process as well as financial incentives, to make return on investment more attractive. Return on investment is just a fancy way of saying profit, but to make it more profitable to develop in those areas and the kinds of development we want to see. Unfortunately, we haven't done that. And I think call up and distribute your site plans, which we're unique to probably in the nation in doing that, continues to be an impediment in creating uncertainty in late stage parts of our development process. The other thing I would mention is that the extent to, well, this is a related point, the extent to which we want to see certain kinds of development. We need to make that development easier, more profitable, and that's not something I think we've done enough of yet. And hopefully we will go in that direction in the way that Parkin plane proposed at the last briefing. The other thing I will mention is this. I was in Bowie recently. I don't get out too much, but I do have to do certain things. And so I was at Bowie and talking to a Bowie city council member, and I was talking about the fact that Bowie seems to be sort of a forgotten child in Prince George's county, even though it's by far the largest municipality and many residents pay a substantial amount of taxes. And Bowie, and Bowie is a big part of our economy. It's almost not even talked about in our economic development plans. And I think in part that's because obviously there's no heavy transit or light rail in Bowie. They only have a mark station, and so it's not one of our focal points in terms of trans illuminate development. But Bowie is big and it's a significant part of our county, but we seem to not have a sense of how do we going forward have a strategy that takes into account the significance of places like Bowie, or even to lesser extent Laurel play in our economic play in terms of our economy. And I would love to hear park and plain's view of how do we address a place like Bui that is not a transit oriented municipality but as a substantial part of our economy and a large number of our residents live there and a large amount of our tax base is tied to Bowie. I'd love to hear park and planning's view about how we should address and treat Bowie going forward in the near and distant future. So the Bowie Mitchellville and vicinity plan was completed by the planning department, I believe, either last year or two years ago, and we're currently working on a sectional map amendment to look at zoning in the Bowie Mitchellville area. I think that'll be coming to the county council in the next few months for final adoption. I think getting that right size zoning in place in Bowie is going to help for some redevelopment activities.

Councilmember Franklin, I know you mentioned the lack of transportation infrastructure in Bowie. They do have a markstation and I know that our office has worked closely with Bowie State University and folks in the redevelopment authority looking at how we can capitalize on the area around the mark station for development to make sure that Bowie State remains the viable institution that it is. It's one of a really few, I think, universities around the country that has dedicated transit, literally right next to it, where you can walk out of a train and walk into a classroom. So that's something that we really want to help Bowie State move along with. And, you know, we stand ready to work with the city of Bowie in any of their economic development opportunities that they have come up and just back in on the mark station. This being my 14th year on the council, and obviously councilmember Dunoga and councilmember Olson predate me. The talk about redevelopment around the Bowie Mark station has been going on for quite a long time, probably to more than 20 years, and nothing's ever happened. I don't know if you have a sense of what the challenges have been with the development around the blue Mark station. I believe there was an RFP out that got canceled for development plans. For development proposals around the mark station. Any sense as to why it's been so difficult to get any action going in terms of high quality development around the Boemark station? I couldn't speak about specific reasons and I'd hesitate to get into any specifics without being more knowledgeable in that particular process. But any of the obstacles that they have identified, we're happy to help them where we can. Understood. Thank you. Thank you, mister chair. Thank you, Mister Franklin. Master plans. I mean, you mentioned the various plans that we were going through, but Mister Franton and I have been arguing that we need to do more master planning throughout the county, and he's talking about Bowie and mentioning Laurel. I've been trying to get a subregion one master plan the entire time I've been back, and it's not happening. I don't know how Mister Franklin thinks about subregion five and six plans because he was involved with that when he started on the council and they finally got adopted, but they're really getting old. So we hear it's a budget problem and it's a capacity problem. Is there anything that park and planning is doing to address the capacity problems so that we can do more master plans per year because we have so much of the county that's out of date? Well, when we, we've got two sector plans going on right now, the blue and Silver Line Central Avenue corridor plan, as well as the port towns plan. And we're also putting the finishing touches on the west Hightsville, Queens Chapel plan. We've also got two standalone smas, the Bowie SMA that I mentioned and the central branch Avenue SMA that's going on. So it's not that we're not doing things, but not enough. But, you know, right now we are at capacity with the amount of projects that we can handle. But one of the things that we're trying to do to make sure that we're really making sure that areas where plans aren't working is that master plan evaluation project that I touched on earlier. We want to make sure that our six year work program is touching on the areas that have the most need. And so I think that that will help us further identify areas where we can make refinements to our six year work program. And you did kind of touch on something that's near and dear to my heart, looking at a more subregional context for doing plans and kind of getting out of the smaller sector, plan geographical areas and looking at a larger, more comprehensive area area. So I think that that's something that you'll start seeing from us in the future, hopefully. Thank you. To follow up on something I've raised before, the Supreme Court recently ruled on Attica public facility legislation. Has Parkin planning done any legal analysis to see how that affects our current laws or how it might influence our potential changes? Yes, our legal department has started doing an analysis on that, but they don't have any findings prepared at this. So we can talk about that. I think that's very important. Yes, the Supreme Court rules. Yes, we kind of need to. We're taking it very seriously, but we are waiting for a final analysis from our legal department. Okay. And I guess probably the last thing I want to say is I appreciate, and I really do, that you're moving forward on an economic analysis of development. I've been complaining about the lack of that for quite a while, and I also reach back to the analysis I've seen in other jurisdictions, and frankly, I think this jurisdiction probably in the nineties, we kind of know the answer. It's good to get updated information, but all one has to do is look at our CIP budget. We're not funding any fire stations at the present time. We're barely funding fire station repairs. We don't have enough operating capacity to fund firefighters across the county. Schools were backlogged, billions of dollars. All you have to do is go to the CIP budget and see that development fees that are being paid and tax revenue that's being generated don't fund the government.

And as we get close to the end of the term of this council, I never think it's wise, as you get to the end of the term for an outgoing council to be doing a lot of policy changes. But I guess that's where we'll be. That's all I had to say. I know Miss Fisher had another point she'd like to raise. It was just very brief. I was just a newer council member, so they may already know this. How much does park and planning work with our economic development corporation? Like, I'm very poor, Angie. I've been, like, doing all this random work on. I just want more rooftop amenities, rooftop bars in the more urban part of the county. And, like, how do I incentivize builders to do those things? So I just wanted to know, like, your relationship on how you guys do economic. The economic development part of our county and our planning. We have a very close relationship with the economic Development Agency as well as the redevelopment authority. We recognize that they are vital partners. I've always said planning and economic development shouldn't be diametrically opposed. They should work together and I think we do a pretty good job with that in Prince George's County. I think a part of the plans, at least for me, like, I'm just a piggyback on councilmember Franklin's point. Like, we should be seeing the economic actual part of that plan as plans are presented. Like, this is how we think we're going to get more revenue or this is how we're going to incentivize the industry to do what we're asking them to do. I don't think it should just be like, this is the plan. These are the issues. Here's the 2035 plan. Like, where's the piece of that plan that's bringing in money to this county? Well, it is vested with the council, so it is up to the council and our partner agencies to put it into motion. Anyone else? As we wrap up? Well, thank you very much for the presentation and the discussion, and I'm sure we'll see you guys again soon. So we'll transition to CB 15 and we'll take a two minute break while we wait for the staff to come up. It's, it's, yeah, everybody I'll see you later. No, Brick. So, Mbia. Okay, we're back and we're moving on to CB 15, 2024. We've had this in committee on two or three occasions already. So today we're going to consider the outstanding amendments. The list that I have is three amendments by Mister Olson and a request from the land use bar. And assuming we get through all that, I expect that we'll move the bill as amended out. That's my expectation. I see. They're putting a three minute time limit on me. Good idea. So I'll turn to miss Hightower for maybe a review of the amendments that are before us. Okay. And I'll just say any public comments should be limited to those amendments. Good morning. Still chair. Done. And members of the committee, we have three amendments from councilmember Olson. One amendment relates to property conveyed by the University of Maryland. We have another amendment that deals with development of townhouses and multifamily units on out lots. And we have an amendment requiring regarding notice requirements for zoning map, amendment applications, district council notices. I would like to say that councilmember Olson's newly proposed amendments begin on page 472 through 475 of your virtual binder. Also, the planning board comments on the amendments are listed on page 481 through 483 of your virtual binder. And also we're going to be entertaining a fourth item which is regarding the land use bar's request. The planning department's comments and responses to that request are listed on page 476 through 469 of your virtual binder. That's all I have. Thank you. Thank you. I guess we'll turn to miss hall if she wants to provide park and planning's position on the various amendments. Good morning. Lakesha hall, planning director for Prince George's county for the record. So in regards to the last remaining amendments, we have amendments in regards to what we're calling the out lot amendment. So we do have our response for all the amendments in the record. So right at this time, we're not taking any position on the out lot amendment or the University of Maryland amendment as well, and then also the state conveyances. But we do have an analysis that's included for the record in regards to the. What we're calling the land use bar request. We do have a response. Just to reiterate, you know, we have the SMA process and that we will defer to council on how they want to proceed with that request. So we're here to answer any additional questions. Thank you. But if I understand the. You have no position on the three amendments from Mister Olson. But what's the position on the land use barque? Is that opposition?

Good morning. Lakesha hall, planning director for Prince George's county for the record. So in regards to the last remaining amendments, we have amendments in regards to what we're calling the out lot amendment. So we do have our response for all the amendments in the record. So right at this time, we're not taking any position on the out lot amendment or the University of Maryland amendment as well, and then also the state conveyances. But we do have an analysis that's included for the record in regards to the. What we're calling the land use bar request. We do have a response. Just to reiterate, you know, we have the SMA process and that we will defer to council on how they want to proceed with that request. So we're here to answer any additional questions. Thank you. But if I understand the. You have no position on the three amendments from Mister Olson. But what's the position on the land use barque? Is that opposition? So in regards to the memo that we submitted, for the record, it was submitted. I am going to pull that up. I'll just read what our position is on that one so that you guys can have it for your context. So thank you very much. And so I'm just going to read from specifically on page three of the document. So just to go to the middle of the document. In 2022, the language already adopted by the Fed committee is intended to allow the district council to rezone property through the SMA process. Since the authority has existed for decades, planning department supports retaining this authority and allowing it to supersede any grandfathering provisions. So that's pretty much the crux of the memo. But as I said, at this time, we'll defer to council for how they would like to proceed. Okay, thank you. Miss McNeil, did you have any questions or comments? If I had any, it wouldn't be substantive. Okay, Miss Skinner. Thank you, mister chair. And good morning again, committee members. We are joined with DCA Angie Rogers and she will share the administration's position on the four proposed amendments. Miss Rogers, good morning. Yes, still morning. My one substantive comment is on amendment number four. And the addition of publicly owned land to this amendment, I think is counter to our economic development goals in general. You're saying no. So I think we would want to understand sort of what's the potential impact of this. We typically, particularly with the change that happened last year, to move the disposition of public land over to RDA so that it satisfies our economic development goals for that is not what this does then. Council member Olson, if I could. Yeah, if I could reply, this is to allow the, to not have the neighborhood compatibility standards apply if it's abutting, if it's within 150ft of publicly owned land, so it allows more density next to publicly owned land. Okay, I was reading it, yes, the opposite way. If I could intervene for a moment, I had questions and I think that council member Olson had an example that helped me understand how this could be helpful. So, for instance, you had a transit oriented a piece of land, you know, near a transit oriented area, and you have a neighborhood on one side, but on the other side you have park and planning land that's zoned residential at this time, the way without the amendment, you would have to step down to that park and planning land, which is woods. I think it makes more sense for economic development and transorganic development to be able to fully develop that side of the building. So now that I understand. You mean that it's written the opposite way, then? Yes, that is. Thank you. When I read it this morning, I was like, oh, no, no. That's exactly the opposite of what we want to do. My next one is actually just asking for clarification on the amendment. There's not an amendment number on the sheet that I'm looking at, but the conveyance of public land in the Ros zone to another public entity. Just some clarification on sort of what's the intention? Yes. Thank you. So in CB 15, the drafters or the parking planning had changed the. Well, anyway, this restores the language and the process that had always been between when the university conveys land to a private entity, which the surrounding community and the University of Maryland were fine with, but it got changed in CB 15. I've gone back to the university and the surrounding communities. Everybody's fine with changing it back to the way it's always been. So no harm, no foul. So I guess I'm just wondering, what's the distinction in the designation based on who would end up with the land? Why make a distinction between. Well, it's been like that for decades and, you know, there's been reason why, you know, there's been concern in the community about, you know, making sure that there's a voice in what happens. It's what worked very fine, frankly. The university, as we all know, can develop on its land with and do a long term lease to avoid any of this if they chose to. It's a way for everybody to be working well together as partners. So the intention would be essentially, if it's going to a private entity and they need to go through a process that then would involve the public. And I've spoken extensively with the real estate people at the University of Maryland who are fine with this change. I know they didn't submit anything, but I'm putting that out on the record. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Miss Hernandez. Anything from the office of law? No, we don't have any additional comments. Okay, we'll turn to our speaker. Any questions from staff or staff?

So this just says the notice has to be done in accordance with the way that it's typically done. So that's all. Yep. You're welcome. Okay, we'll turn to our speakers list. We have three speakers. Mister Haller, Mister Gibbs, Mister Tedesco, and there, I guess, unless the technical folks disagree. Oh, we're doing a podium now? Sure. You missed it. It's on. Good morning, mister Chairman, members of the committee, Thomas Hallerin turning the offices here in Largo, and I wanted to speak briefly about two of the amendments. The first amendment that I'd like to speak on is Amendment four, which is the amendment. Mister Haller? It doesn't sound like the microphone's on screens. Am I not close enough? I'm not close enough. Okay. Again, thank you. Thomas Haller, attorney officer here in Largo, and I'm here today speaking regarding two of the amendments, the first one being amendment four, which is proposed by Councilmember Olson. That relates to this, references out lots. And essentially, I think just Mister Olson summarized it well. What the bill does is it clarifies that the neighborhood compatibility standards are not kicked in if you are adjacent to certain types of undeveloped and undevelopable residentially zoned land. And what this clarification was added to CB 15 as a result of discussions with the building industry association last summer. And this amendment clarifies it to include publicly owned lands and lands that are designated as out lots in a subdivision. And by definition, an out lot is an undevelopable parcel. So the idea is to not put restrictions on development adjacent to vacant lands that can't be developed. And so we would support that amendment as proposed by Mister Olson. And there's a revision to that amendment that was provided, which we also agree to. The other amendment that I'd like to speak on is the issue related to the request by the land use bar related to the transitional provisions. And I do want to make sure I didn't testify on this at the prior committee work session because I had to leave. But I just want to make sure that there's no confusion. As you know, one of the big issues that we've had with the implementation of the countywide map amendment is the impact that it has on projects that were properties that were developed under the old ordinance. And so one of the key components of the transitional provisions are grandfathering provisions, which are set forth in the, in the revised transitional provisions. And we support those. The concern that we have is that the amendment that we're seeking does not prevent the county from downzoning a property through an SMA. All it says is that if the county does downzone a property through the SMA, it does not take away the grandfathering. Because as the code is written, it says you're grandfathered for the period set forth in the ordinance. But we can take it away immediately through the adoption of a sectional map amendment. We don't think that that's providing grandfathering. That puts a property owner in position where the very grandfathering that he was relying on through the transitional provisions is then stripped away through adoption of an SMA. We just don't want that to happen because we've all agreed to the timeframes for the grandfathering. So that's, that's. I just wanted to make sure it was clear that there's no intent on the part of the land use bar to prevent the county from downzoning a property. It's just a question of whether it strips away their grandfathering protections. Thank you, Mister Haller. If we didn't adopt this, then it would just be the old rules and it would be a non conforming use. And you don't want the non conforming use status? Well, again, the concern is that the properties that were constructed under the prior ordinance are protected by the grandfathering provisions. That's what we don't want to lose. And so. Yeah, but you were right, it would then put it into the non conforming youth status, which has completely different rules than the transitional provisions. Okay, thank you, Mister Gibbs. Yes, good. Good morning, Councilman Durnoga, members of the committee, Edward Gibbs, an attorney with offices here in Largo. And I'll tag on to what Mister Haller just said and maybe add a little bit to it. I did testify about the land use bar request relative to 20 717 oh seven B at the work session on April 18.

And I would just like to reiterate those comments and urge the adoption of the language that we had proposed. The CMA obviously is a countywide rezoning. It's an extraordinary event that has occurred, and the transitional provisions are meant to protect those properties that have developed under the prior ordinance. We think we now have a set of transitional provisions that are quite good and we have supported those and we appreciate the effort that has been made by you, the council, and by the park and planning Commission to come up with a set of transitional provisions that work for everyone to the greatest extent possible. Not necessarily perfect, but pretty good. The concern with the provision in question in 1707 B, as drafted by staff, is that it will have the effect of stripping away the ability to use the transitional provisions that have been created because you will no longer be, quote, legal and conforming as the transitional provisions as modified, say. And that's just a devastating impact and in many respects negates all the work that went into the transitional provisions. And I would just say we're not embarking into new territory here because the council in section 27 223 of the prior ordinance had already put limitations in for down zoning properties in a sectional map amendment if they were rezoned within five years before that. So this is not a new concept to protect grandfathering rights for properties. And that's all we're really trying to do. The only other comment I wanted to make real quickly is I never saw an amendment sheet on, on the vote that was taken on the 18th with regard to data centers in the AG zone. I never saw an amendment sheet on that. I didn't know if there had to be one, but. Or whether it's just going to be included in draft two, which I haven't seen yet, but I just wanted. That was voted favorably. I don't know if there was an amendment. I have a question for you, Mister Gibson. I don't know if it was an amendment sheet or not, but the committee voted it. They did. Yeah. So I know that happened. Yeah, for sure. You make a point, which is sort of my argument, which is the councils had the priorities, had limitations on down zoning through smas for years. This adds to it. But is this needed? The council is not very typically down zoning properties, and there's very few smas in process at the moment. So I'm just wondering, I mean, you can argue this either way. You're making it sound like this could bring things to a screeching halt. But I'm looking at this going, we already have limitations on down zoning that exist and we don't have any real. I'm not aware of any effort to downs on any particular properties. We typically don't, having been around for a couple of couple years, three decades, I have seen situations where that has occurred in the past. But it's not so much that it is an imminent threat. It is the fact that we have to advise clients that, okay, you have the protections of these transitional provisions, but wait if something happens in a mini sector plan six months from now and you get placed in a non conforming situation, forget it. It doesn't help you. And that creates instability financially for getting loans and for land development, because they get concerned and it's just a reality of life. It's not that there would be any attempt to hurt somebody that way. It's just that that capability exists. And that's the point. Thank you, Mister Gibbs. So, Mister Tedesco, good morning. Good morning, Mister chairman. Members of the committee, for the record, Matthew Tedesco, the law firm of McMillian Greenbelt, I would echo and further incorporate and adopt the comments that I made on April 18 at the committee meeting with respect to what's being referred to as the zoning bars request to 20 717 oh seven b. I would further incorporate and adopt Mister Gibbs and Mister Haller's testimony this morning. I know we're at least this morning's conversation focused in on down zoning concerns, but it really goes beyond just down zoning concerns. The reality is that the prior zoning ordinance and the new zones that were implemented through the CMA are not consistent. There's differences. Some are good, some are not so good. But what we have is development in the county that doesn't conform to the new zoning ordinance, and what we have all worked tirelessly for, for more than two years. And we are at a very good place that Mister Gibbs indicated and Miss hall indicated, with transition provisions that we think get us farther along and closer to where we need to be to protect those investments. What the language as it currently exists in 1707 B does is that it provides the opportunity to strip those protections away from people that are otherwise protected. And I know, Chairman Dunoga, you mentioned we don't really do a lot of these smas and down zonings, but it goes a little bit beyond the down zonings, because we do have these developments that just don't conform to the new standards. And how are we treating this? We've all decided we're giving them ten years, in most instances, 20, and very few instances. And that's the way the world's going to be, and we're good with that.

But this language, as it currently is drafted, provides the potential, admittedly a potential for an SMA to come in, or even a minor amendment to an SMA. This new ordinance allows the council to do minor amendments. You've done two of them recently. That could happen much more expediently than a true sector plan in SMA. And if that happens, that protection that we've all agreed to thus far gets stripped away. So we feel it's very important to include this language as requested by the zoning bar, to just keep the playing field level. We're notwithstanding the fact that the council will forever and fully have the right to do amendments to the smas and or new smas under the new zoning ordinance. And so there is some nuances there. We do feel like it's necessary. I do want to thank Miss hall and her staff again for getting us to the one inch line. I would say with this minor tweak, I think we're fully there. So thank you so much. I'll be quiet after this. But it strikes me that in that rare instance where the council thinks, you know what, we should really down zone this property, because there's something going on here. The council is saying, you know what? We don't want that authority anymore. Yeah, that's what we're saying. Okay. We don't need authority to do zoning, Mister Olson. We've got three amendments. Take your pick. Yeah, we have three amendments, and I know that one of them has a slight tweak to it that Ms. Zivakis has. I wonder if we should do that one first. They don't have numbers on them. Is this. Which one is it? Here's what I'm calling them. We have the out lot, the University of Maryland and the state of Maryland. Notice we are on out lot, sir. Yeah. The revised version. Yes. Which will be subject to further revision. Welcome to the flying Karen's. Buck has this. Well, I hope this is vegan sausage, because I don't eat sausage. Vegan sausage. Absolutely. Go ahead. Yes. Right. So working from the additional information that was sent this morning in the virtual binder email this morning sent. And as I flap further into the abyss here. Okay. 09:04 a.m. and the version that we should all be looking at says revised out lot at the very top in the header. Right. So you look at line four of this proposed amendment, you'll see that there is a proposed bracket around the word or. And then there's just the unchanged environmental. And then it says, or other features. Then it trails into another clause that says that reasonably prevent any residential use of said vacant lands. The idea is to keep this as such, but to strike the language in the end of line four that says that reasonably prevent any residential use of said vacant lands, we will cut that language there and the rest shall go as it actually would be. Keeping environmental features. The word environmental feature should not be strict. It's not being. If I may. Planning department. Chad Williams. For the record, the planning department has offered some comment this morning on this, so if I may, it may be clear if I would read what lines four and five should say in our recommendation. So it would say, starting in line for open space, comma, existing protective easement, comma, or environmental features that prevent any residential use of said vacant lands, semicolon, or an outlet as defined by section 24 2300. So you remove in a few brackets and the word or other and reasonably correct. So we're getting rid of the reasonably. We're getting rid of the other.

I am the district one council member in Montgomery county and currently serving as the president of the council. I did want to note we have a new executive director, Cabin west, who will be on shortly along with your executive director, but wanted to thank and welcome him and know he's been recorded. Okay.

A motion is made by a member of one council must be seconded by a member of the other council. Also, a majority of each council must vote in favor of a motion in order for it to pass. President Friedsen, if you agree, I suggest that we adopt another practice of recent years, and that is to vote on all the budgets in one omnibus motion. If that is acceptable, I will ask Prince George's County Council Administrator Jennifer Jenkins and Montgomery County Council executive Director Kevin west to briefly summarize their joint staff recommendations on the MNC, PPC, WSSC and WSDC budgets. It is, and I appreciate it. Thank you. Okay. Good afternoon, chair Ivey, President Friesen and all members of the Prince George's and Montgomery county councils. I am Jennifer Jenkins, the administrator for the Prince George's county council. And with me is my colleague Kaven west, the new executive director of the Montgomery County Council. Before I begin with our report, I want to take a moment to thank all the members of both of our county councils. Last year was historical. When Cavan's predecessor, Marlene Michelson, and I sat before you, it was the first time in by county history for two women to do so. And this year, Caven, it is me and a black man and a black woman who for the majority of the time this country has existed, could not have served in these roles. And for many years, not that long ago, this would not have happened. It speaks to the commitment of every county council member here to diversity and inclusion, equity and fairness, and we thank you. It is an honor to serve in your top leadership positions. I now go on to the first part of our staff report, the Maryland National Capital Market Planning Commission budget. We reached a consensus that in light of fiscal constraints, both counties would take a slight reduction from their proposed budgets. For Prince George's County, $454,251 and from Montgomery County, $467,012. Regarding compensation, the councils agree with the compensation markers proposed by the commissions and further agree that they should not exceed those amounts because the two counties may have different compensation structures. The commissions will determine the compensation levels within those markers and now turn over to Kaven. Thank you. Yeah, I just need. Yep, I just need the host to allow the camera to start. You're in. We can see you now. Okay, great. Good afternoon. Thank you, Miss Jenkins. You know Kevin west here. I'm the new executive director for the Montgomery County Council for the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, the operating budget and capital improvement program. We recommend approval of the joint staff recommendations as noted in the attachment page one through four. For the Washington Suburban Transit Commission budget, we recommend approval of the FY 25 amounts proposed. For Montgomery county, that's approximately 170,000. For Prince George, it's approximately 150,000. The information detail in these amounts can be found in letters from the Montgomery County Council and the Prince George Council chair. Attaching page five through nine. This concludes our joint recommendations for the by county commission report. And I turn that back over to either chair, President Friedsen or chair Ivan. Is there a motion to approve all three budgets and actions. As reflected in the joint staff recommendations. So moved. Second. Okay, so that would be Kate Stewart from Montgomery county and Sydney Harrison from Prince George's county. Is there any discussion? All those in favor, please say aye or raise your hand. Or both. Aye. Are there any opposed? The budget stand approved. Is there a motion to adjourn? So moved. Second motion made by Walla Bligue on Prince George's side. And Kate Stewart on the Montgomery county side. I believe that's right, because I don. But that's okay. Sorry. All those in favor, please signify by raising your hand or saying hi. Adjourned.

Good morning, everyone. Today is Monday, April 15. I'm sure you either filed your taxes or filing an extension. So I'm sure everybody's good. We are here on an off day, a Monday, because of budget. And before we get to budget, we will deal with CB 28. So I'll turn to Miss Hightower to get us oriented. Yes. Good morning, chair and members of the PHED committee. The first thing we'll discuss today is CB 28 2024, which amends the zoning ordinance to define cigar club lounge and permit the use in the commercial neighborhood, commercial service, and commercial general and office zones of the county. And establishes regulations governing the use and furtherance of the public safety, health and welfare of the residents of Prince George's county. The planning board took no position on CB 28 2024, but had some technical drafting amendments. They sent a revised version of the bill and are here to address any questions. Also, the zoning hearing examiner provided two comments which Miss Kay Karen Cevacos will cover when she speaks. Also, the office of law is here to provide any comments that they may have. Thank you, chair. Okay, thank you. We'll turn to the sponsor. Mister Hawkins, what are we doing? Thank you, Mister Dunoga. This bill intent is to provide an opportunity to establish locations where we could have some cigar lounges in the district of Columbia, Shelley's backroom, TG cigars and Papworth. And talking to the ownership of each of those respective establishments. They say at least at a minimum 40% of their customers from Prince George's county. When you go to Charles county and deal with Tinderbox and Invictus, you get up to over 50% of their clients are from Prince George's county. And over the Anne Arundel county. When you look at Titans and Cigar lounge, you have close to 45% of their patrons are from Prince George's county. And after hearing a lot of discussion about the need to have cigar loungers in Prince George's county, this is how we came with this bill that is before us today. Or this legislation. Okay, thank you. Questions from committee members. Yeah, I remember going to a cigar lounge once in Laurel. It's been a few years. Are you familiar with it? I don't do tobacco or other things. Okay, well, okay. I was just checking to see if it were still in business. I'll take that as it probably not. I don't know about that. I only went once and I did not smoke. Smoke a cigar, but. Oh, I think I know what you're talking about. I was there on election night for city elections last year. Oh, okay. I didn't smoke any tobacco though. Okay. Bill Clinton. I have a question for Mister Williams. According to the memo, I think Parkin planning's initial position before recommending a number of changes to make the bill fit better in the ordinance. You didn't think we needed a bill? That's correct, sir. We viewed cigar lounge much the same as a hookah bar, which is not illicit use, but it's so close to other uses that it's interpreted as those uses. So when a hookah bar or cigar lounge would serve food and drink, and over 50% of the area's food and drink is an eating or drinking establishment. If it's less than 50% food and drink, and they can still serve it, but it's less than 50% of their area, it's a tobacco shop. So from that perspective, we didn't feel the bill was needed. But we did see this bill as an attempt to limit where tobacco shop, I'm sorry. Where cigar lounges could be located. And from that perspective, if that's something that the sponsors are looking to do to clarify where these lounges are permitted, then the planning board has signed off on an alternate draft that we would ask the sponsor to consider substituting for draft one. Okay, thank you. I noticed that it's only limited to certain commercial zones, Mister Hawkins. I was surprised it wasn't included in downtown zones. Would park and planning be opposed to that? Because it seems like if I understand the supporters position, this is an amenity and an attraction, but it's only allowed in three zones. And there's a lot of things that park and planning would not like to see in downtown areas. But it seems like this is an amenity or an attraction that would make sense. Well, extrapolating from the planning board's recommendation and no position, I would say that this would be a policy call to council. I'm certainly open to what Mister Dunoga just referenced. Mister Varkas, any reason we didn't put that in there to your knowledge? No, sir, but it could be. If it's the will of the body to include it, we could certainly add it as a permitted use in those zones. It may affect the parking requirements, however. So I defer to the committee. Yes, the parking requirements are in the proposed planning board draft for inside and outside of Beltway based on the zones that were selected. So the council would need to identify parking requirements for the transit oriented activity center zones. If the council wishes to permit this use there.

I wouldn't want to hold the bill up for that. Mister Hawkins. But it just dawned on me that this was something that made sense in regional, more like regional transit districts rather than local centers. To not hold the build up. Mister chair, how can we address your very important observation? I defer to Miss Zavakos. Hot potato. False. To Miss Zavakos. Yes. Basically it's a draftsman change, but the policy call is entirely within the committee's discretion. So it's something, if you would like to. To change that, you can certainly add it. That can be incorporated into the draft too. You know, if there's a motion to favorably recommend proposed draft from planning board, you could also direct staff to add additional zones, but I would need to know what those were in order to craft appropriate parking requirements. Requirements. The recommendation at the end of the day, sir, while I totally defer to your policy call, would be to go with the original proposal and perhaps explore expanding it once we've seen how its impact shakes out in the community. Mister Nogu, what do you think about what Karen just said? I see two options. One is to do what she said and just adopt this and then look to the future. And the other is put this. Have a. Have some internal discussion on this. I think we have a really busy agenda Thursday, so I wouldn't want to try to put on for Thursday. Our next meeting is in a month because the budget. We're missing the first session we normally have in May, so it'd be like May 16. So it depends on how urgent this is to get out. You could wait till May 16. I would offer that we hold this or the proper motion to May the 16th just to get that part right. Yeah. Thank you, sir. Okay, so we have a motion to hold. I'll second it. Any discussion? Well, actually, before we do that, let me jump to the agencies and county execs team before we take a motion. Good morning, Mister Dunoga and colleagues or committee members. The county executive takes no position on CB 28 2024. Thank you, Mister Hernandez. Sure. We just asked that if there are any amendments that the office law knows about it so that we can make sure we have any appropriate comments. Okay. And Mister Williams, there's just one more point that the planning board would like to make. And that is, even if you move forward with this bill, with the expansions that you're talking about coming back on May 16, we believe you do need to amend subtitle 19, specifically 19 131 of the code which governs indoor smoking and eating and drinking establishments. The definition references it. And until you update that section, that will limit where cigar lounges may actually operate. We see. Mister Franklin, welcome. Right, so we need a separate bill for that. We can't put that correct. Yes. Well, that gives us a reason to hold it till May 16, is that you need to put in a drafting request and make that amendment to subtitle 19 Mississippi. Do you agree that there's an amendment needed? Not necessarily. I looked at this and discussed it with the committee director and said that I was not necessarily in agreement that it's necessary. But in light of the committee's desire to see an expanded array of zones in which the use can be located, we can certainly nail that down. And if there's another piece of legislation, namely to amend subtitle 19 needed, we can address it. Mister chair, can you explain to council member Franklin where we are at this time? Mister Franklin. There. We're going over. We can't hear you. But I was trying to understand. Mister Franklin, we can't hear you. Unfortunately. I'm not sure why. Can you hear us? I can hear you fine. I don't know why you can't hear you. Unfortunately. Tech staff is looking to figure it out. Mister Hawkins asked me to orient you. We were moving forward on CB 28, but I raised the issue that maybe we wanted to include regional transit zones or things of that nature. So we decided to hold this until May 16 and work out some additional locations between now and then. And perhaps if we need to update subtitle 19, then we can do that. We can get that bill moving at the same time. You still can't hear me, right? We're still not hearing you. They're working on it. He can definitely hear us because he's responding to the comments that we can't hear him right. So if you nod, we'll know that you at least heard Tom give the update. Okay. All right. Sorry, Mister Franklin. And is that okay with you to delay it a couple of weeks while we work out those details? Details? No. Okay. You want to move forward today? All right, well, let's just stick with Mister Hawkins. It's your call. It's your bill. I'm supporting whichever way you want to go. Okay. Mister Franklin is on board to move forward. I appreciate what you said, mister chair. I make a motion that we move favorably. Second for planning boards alternative draft. Yes. Okay. We have a motion to secondary discussion.

We're going to move on to financial services corporation and hopefully Mister Franklin will get you set up technologically. Okay. Are we ready? Good morning, all. I'll turn to miss Hightower to orient us. Yes, we are going to. We have a budget work session with the Financial Services Corporation and we are going. I would like to turn to miss Shailene Miller Y to give a budget overview. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. Chair done. Vice chair Ivey as well as members of the phed committee. For the record, my name is Shailen Miller Y and I am the budget and I am with the budget and policy analyst division. I will be providing you an overview of the Financial Services Corporation. I want to thank FFC first and OMB for the information they provided that is included in this report. All information will be summarized and further details can be found in the report in the responses. The FFC first report is on page four of your virtual binder. The fiscal year 2025 proposed budget for the Financial Services Corporation is 2,380,000, which is a decrease of 1,028,100 or below 30.2% from the fiscal year 2024 budget. FFC first is particularly funded through the county grant for fiscal year 2025. The county grant is proposed at 1,177,100, which is unchanged from fiscal year 2024. In terms of revenue, the net change contributing to the decrease of approximately 1 million is due to the elimination of the ARPA grant at 1.1 million and anticipated decrease in net loan income at 111,600 as well as the increase of management and service fees of 148,600 in net fundraising revenue at 55,000. The full chart can be found on page two of the report. Other income, which includes expected gallup fundraising efforts is projected at 50,000. An increase of 35,000. Compensation is proposed at 1,285,100. In terms of staffing due to the removal of the ARPA grant, five positions will go unfunded on June 30, 2024. These positions support various technical assistance programs with the level up program. For fiscal year 2025, operating expenditures are proposed as 663,200, an increase of 620,800 or below 48.3% from fiscal year 2024. A few major items include contractual costs at 150,000, which is anticipated decrease of 510,500 or 77.3% below fiscal year 2025 due to the end the ending of ARPA funding an indirect cost at 513,200 which is a decrease of 110,300 or 17.7% due to the end of ARPA funding. Other operated decreases include operating expenses for education and training, with a decrease of 266,700 in supported businesses with a decrease of 226,300. In terms of the EDI fund, as of November 2023, the EDI Fund has closed 21 conventional loans totaling 24.2 million and created in or retained a total of 2000 jobs that have closed 28 conventional loans totaling 15.7 million which created or retained a total of 6300 jobs. 51% of jobs are obtained by county residents. On page four and five you can also find the EDI fund balances and activities as of February 29, 2024. Also on page five you will find additional information on FFC's first other loan programs. As a summary, for fiscal year 2024, an estimated 31 loans closed for 10.8 million and 280 jobs are created or supported as of February 2024. The loan balance for the entire portfolio is approximately 39 million. The amount of unfunded loans in in closing is 3.8 million and the amount of loans in the pipeline is 15.4 million. For fiscal year 2024, FFC first has accomplished many of their goals. In summary, it has councils 175 businesses and funded 793,400 in grants for 155 businesses through the county's Purple Line Business Assistance grant program. They also have served 563 businesses in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 2036 businesses in fiscal year 2023 through the Level up program and provided various educational and networking opportunities and technical assistance to small businesses. This can be found on page six of the report, which includes the type of programming offered and the participation levels and programming across districts. Overall, the FFC first has increased the pipeline of participation through technical assistance and improve the overall access to resources and funding opportunities to businesses. Another notable item is that they have improved their loan turnaround time from 75 days to 67 days. Challenges and concerns that FFC first has for fiscal year 25 include rising interest levels which have led to hesitancies for small business owners to engage in debt financing and the tremendous decrease in the number of programs FFC first can offer. Due to loss of the R program that funded the level of program.

Thank you and please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you very much. Any questions for Miss Miller? No, I will turn Mister Hightower. Yes. FSC is going to present a PowerPoint presentation. Okay. Good morning, Miss Medley. Good morning. You can see it. I can. Monday morning, Ted. There we go. All right. Good morning, mister chair members of the committee, click here we go. It's my pleasure for FSC to be with you here again during this budget season to review our legacy the past year we've had and looking forward to the new fiscal year. I'm joined by my chief financial officer, Beverly Elderson Jones. To my left, and on behalf of our team of finance economic development professionals, we're celebrating 46 years this year power businesses throughout the county and the state of Maryland. During our 46 year history of serving the small business of the county, state approved 162.5 million loans and those subsequent loan closings have leveraged 1.5 billion in private dollars invested, resulting in eleven to one average ratio. This 14,000 jobs in the past 26 years, 12,000 of which have been in the last ten. And overall this has contributed to 246.5 million to the commercial tax base and another three and a half million in additional taxes collected. FSC currently has 13 programs, one federally backed program, three state funded programs, two programs for local municipalities, one that fund and manage for the EDC, two green energy programs, and three corporate or bank backed programs. We also have one grant program, the Purple Office Assistance Fund, which collectively has collectively all these programs offer 50 million plus available to lab and that the programs don't have a maximum loan amount so it's open and increasing always. And that's our federal programs. The newest and then the 14th program is Small Business Capital and Growth Stimulus Fund, which was funded as a result of Council Bill 62 2022. FSC will launch this program this month, which is made up of five programs that focus on existing and startup businesses, technology and accelerator programs. Coming out of the second quarter of the fiscal year, FSC closed more loans than we did in all of last year, and that trend is continuing. We're on pace to exceed last fiscal year's year end loan closings by 15%. All numbers in our current pipeline are up. That includes numbers of applications, numbers of successful applications that results in funding and specific loan program activity, like the SBA 504 program, for example. And in this program, those numbers for that program in particular are up. It means that more businesses are purchasing the real estate where they operate or are relocating to properties that they can purchase to operate their businesses, which, as we know, increases the commercial tax base. In addition to business development efforts, the pipeline is also being embedded by our level up technical assistance program, which we'll hear more about shortly. So as a result, today 91% of all the loans provided in our portfolio have been to Prince George's county businesses, and now I will turn it over to Beverly to talk about the level up program. Good morning, everyone. As was mentioned earlier in the presentation, you heard that the level of program has touched hundreds of thousands, over a thousand businesses in the last fiscal year. On slide. I see that we have a number of nonprofit organizations in the county that we work with, including Bowie Bic, Prince Georges of Economic Development Corporation, the Maryland Black Chamber of Commerce, the Prince George's Community College, specifically their financial empowerment center, and several others. By working with these businesses, we've really been able to expand the number of organizations that we have touched. And as was mentioned earlier, the ARPA program has provided significant funding for this program over the last two fiscal years, and that support will end at the end of June 2024. One of the things that we're very proud of is that the level up program has really helped businesses be more prepared to receive capital. The driving force for setting up this program was what we saw as we tried to expand the loan portfolio in the county, and we saw that businesses need to help with their financials, their business plans, as well as certain marketing efforts. So right now we have 20 businesses from the level up program that are in the pipeline to be considered for loans, and three businesses have recently been approved for loans and are in the either have been closed, are in the process of being closed. So we're very proud of the work that the level up program has done to expand access to capital for businesses in accounting. One of the things that we did following another discussion with several council members was to map the businesses by council district. We were not able to map every business. We have served over 1100 businesses in the county.

One of the things that we did following another discussion with several council members was to map the businesses by council district. We were not able to map every business. We have served over 1100 businesses in the county. We were able to map 687 specifically to the council districts that they are a part of. And as you can see here, 31% has come from council district, 415 percent from district six, and 12% from district eight. Those are the three highest. One of the things that we're working on for the time that we have left with the major funding is to get more representation of activities in some of the other council districts, as well as to ensure that our outreach is reaching the businesses across the county. Although we were not able to map each business to the individual council district in time for this presentation, we are working on that so we can have that for information going forward and planning. The other thing we wanted to share with you, just some overall impact. As you saw in the presentation, the part of the presentation talked about the loan programs. We do fund businesses across the state of Maryland, and we touch over 2300 businesses across the state. Actually, the 687 relates to the slide that we just covered. But for the county, we've actually touched over 1300 businesses. In terms of events, we've sponsored over 100 events which businesses have had the opportunity to. To come out and be able to share information about their businesses, which has helped them get exposure. They've been able to hear from experts in the fields of finance, marketing, insurance, and other areas that have been extremely helpful to those businesses. We've had over 1300 attendees from the county, and we have also provided specifically technical assistance hours. These are coaching hours to businesses. That's 420 hours of technical assistance. And then we have some individual coaching programs that we have allowed businesses to sign up for. And we provided so far this fiscal year, 223 hours of those individualized coaching hours. In terms of programming that's going on right now in the month of April, we, in addition to giving technical assistance, we also provide some tools for businesses. So one of the tools we provide is Live plan, which is a tool that helps businesses put together or update a business plan. And we have a session that is going on tomorrow with one of our local businesses leading that. Tisa Clark will lead that, and she has done about eight of those presentations this fiscal year. We also have some readiness programs that we have put together. So, again, businesses know how to prepare to talk with bankers. We have done in the past programs on doing business with the county. And we have a program coming up later in this month, on Wednesday, doing business with the state of Maryland. And then finally some tax strategies for businesses will be presented later this week. One of the things that we believe is really important, and I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to actually do this or if the tech team may have to. We'd like to share a testimony, if we can, from one of our local businesses in terms of their experiences with the level of program. And that's Southern Bale cleaners, which is an organization that was stood up during the pandemic. If you're able to click on the video at the bottom left, do you see that link that's at the bottom of the slide. FSC first, is helping small businesses grow and thrive throughout the region. Here's one of our success stories. I was watching all of the different office buildings and churches that were unable to open because they didn't have good quality cleaning. So I saw a need. I established Southern Belle Cleaners in 2020, basically going after office buildings. And we also provide for janitorial services for churches and property turnovers for realtors. I have an engineering background. I never took one business class at all. When I started the business, I was slowly trying to figure things out. And that's when I really realized, like, hey, I don't know this myself. I saw the FSC first level up program, and so I just started signing up for program after program, and it really started giving me the confidence to make better financial decisions, also make sure my books were in order when it was time to apply for a loan or credit line. And so it really gave me the foundation for getting my business to a better start.

So I want to thank the members of the committee, and I look forward to answering any questions you may have. Okay, thank you very much. Miss Skynyrd, anything you want to add? FSC is awesome. That's it. Mister Early, I have nothing to add at this point. Thank you, committee members, questions. Miss Ivey, thank you and thanks for coming. I was looking through, and maybe you just need to explain to me what I'm looking at. But when you. I looked at the businesses that have received loans, and it would sometimes list what percentage of the employees were from the county, and I was kind of alarmed at some of them. Creative signs 8% Prince George's residence Southland 14% 15% FTI consulting 14% Shankara was good 85% Bates 38% I mean, those kind of numbers, most of them were not good when it comes to employees. And I know that might not be your number one consideration, but it's certainly important to the council how many Prince George's residents are benefiting from these programs. So how exactly does that work? And I saw sometimes they missed the mark and they come back and say, well, we want to renegotiate those numbers for compliance. Right. So I've noticed that those are EDI fund loans. And when the EDI fund is when they make application to the program, they make a commitment to have so many employees, period. And then a certain percentage, in some cases, have to be Prince George's county residents. And that can vary. Some will go as high. For instance, hospitality development group, they had over 100 employees, and they promised that they could guarantee that 100% were going to be Prince George's county residents. So some are very high in some cases. Depends on the kind of business. So cyberry, being a tech business, sometimes finding all of that talent within the county is difficult. And so their numbers won't be 50 or 80 or 100%. It'll be in a range of 15% to 30%, depending on the workforce. And that's why we tried to make collaborations with the University of Maryland to make sure that all that technology that's being, coming out of that college remains here in the county. And so we make special effort to kind of appeal to those particular kind of businesses so they don't leave us. So the EDC kind of takes care of choosing the organizations that get the money, and then you oversee making sure that they comply with the requirements, so. Right. So together, we kind of triage the transaction, see how it's going to return for the county, increase the county's economic development, and depending on their ask, they don't always get what they ask for, depending on what they're willing to do for the county. So we try to marry that against, you know, what they're asking, what the benefit will be, and then FSC does the underwriting, and then we'll service the transaction till it matures or pays off, and then we do the compliance as well, to make sure that they do what they promised. Okay. So to the extent that a company does not meet their goals when it comes to Prince George's residence, what is your role in pushing them to complete compliance or making them pay it off? So our role is to drop the hammer, if you will. So when they have not met those requirements, we do their check ins on them, sometimes semi annually, sometimes annually, depending on how it was negotiated or what they're doing. They're putting up a building. We've got to make sure the building did happen. If they're going to hire employees, we make sure we actually have to do the their job reports to us, and we count heads and we see where these people live as well, to make sure whether they're Prince George's county or not. And if they're short, we reach out to them and ask them to explain and built into the transaction they're clawbacks, so they may have to pay a penalty, or if they're saying, you know, I just need a little more time to make sure I rehire. This is what happened. You know, we had volunteers, people who voluntarily separated from the company. A lot of people in the tech field did experience that coming out of COVID voluntary resignations and leaving the company. You know, people wanted to work remote. They couldn't work remote. They were deciding to leave the company. So sometimes we'll give them a little more time to get back up to those numbers, and other times, we have to say, you failed significantly and you have to reimburse the county. And are you part of deciding if a company is worth the risk? Because there are a couple who went into bankruptcy. There's one, that EDi fund is at risk for $2.8 million. That's the shops at Iverson. That's correct. And we have. We are part of the workout, the liquidation, and the negotiation. And as a result, we've been negotiating, negotiated that we have been able to get back 1,550,000 of those funds back. And generally, when you join liquidation and work out, if you get 50, 55%, that's huge, because generally, you don't get anything close to that. It's usually 30, 35% in a workout.

Thank you. Mister Hawkins, I have no questions. Mister chairman, Miss Wiser, Mister Franklin, are you with us? Emily? Can't hear you. Are you able to hear me? Okay, Mister Olson had a question that he asked us to relay, which is, are there ways for FSC first loans to be more affordable? Mentioned that the rate seemed too close to market rate and didn't see the benefit. So he was wondering if there are things that you can do. So the rates are based on risk of the client. Generally. Most of our clients are pre bankable or under bankable. Either they couldn't get a bank loan at all, or they generally cannot get enough financing from a bank. But we're more than half more affordable than anything. Like a, I'll just say an online fintech lender kind of situation. FSC, all our financing is not grant based. We have pricing also, so we're paying for money that we then have to relend. But we try to keep the rate as low as possible and still be able to repay the underlying loan as well. So where our dollars are grant based, we're able to make some of those rates more affordable. But they're always generally cheap, way less expensive than a credit card or anything they could get from a fintech or non main street lender. I understand. So it looks the same rate, but this is for people who really can't get that rate otherwise. Right. Miss Watson, thank you. I'm not on the committee, but I do have a question for you. It's great to see that district four is kind of leveled up in the level up program, and I see where the program will end in June. So how will that impact those businesses, and what do you see in regards to the future for them in regards to funding? The program we're able to provide is going to be greatly diminished. What we did with the two and a half million dollars of ARPA dollars has really catapulted our ability to give businesses the technical assistance they've needed, because what we experienced in the past without the level up program is we refer the business to a technical assistance provider, and then they never come back. They never come back to obtain the financing that they were seeking in the first place. So we designed this program to make sure they got the specific help that they needed in the areas where they needed in their businesses, and they then could actually get the financing that they were seeking to grow their business. So while we're looking for grants where we can find them to try and shore up this program and continue it, it will pale in comparison to what ARPA provided to us. And so while we're optimistic that we'll be able to continue some services, it will not be at the level, so to speak, that it is now with level up. Thank you. Miss Ivey? Yes. Mister Franklin did send this question. He wants to know if any EDI recipient has, has ever received a penalty for not meeting supplier diversity or local hiring requirements. Yes. Can you speak to that a bit? Do you want me to. I don't want to name them, per se, but that was the case of jobs that they did not meet. And they just said, we're not going to meet it. So we said, fine, here's your penalty. And they did pay it. They did pay it. There were others. There is one other where we had to do a full clawback because they were actually bought out by a company that wasn't even in this country, and there was hundreds of jobs that were supposed to be created, that they initially did create, but then they were supposed to stay in the county for the life of the loan. So we called back the entire amount of that loan. So, and that was significant as well. So there's been two cases where we actually clawed back cash. In other cases where we gave them a little more time and then they did comply. Okay, thank you. We might be able to hear you now, Mister Franklin. Let's see. Sorry, Mister Franklin, I put a couple, I put a question in the chat. Okay, let's try this. Okay. Yes. Okay. My only other question is what is the launch date for the small business growth capital fund? So we hope to launch that no later than the 25 April or slightly before. We'll make sure that council members have the announcement ahead of when the actual launch date will be. We're setting up in that legislation. There's a lot of technical pieces of where businesses have to be located and so we're just introducing that into our application portal so that when we do the eligibility part of the process we're in compliant with the legislation. So we expect to test that technology next week and we should be able to roll it out immediately after that. Great. And how will you publicize it to the business community? I already announced it on Radio one on those channels that it was coming this month and then we'll put it out to our over 6000 email list of all businesses. It'll also be in our newsletter that reaches the same. We can also share that with council members so that they can send it out.

We got to figure out this Mister Franklin issue but thank you Miss Ivey. I think any other questions? And over. Wait a minute. I'm sorry. Oh no, I think it was a black eye with that. I'll. Thank you, Miss Medley, we appreciate you coming before us and giving us all that information and hopefully everything will go swimmingly in the rest of the budget. Thank you very much. And we will turn to experienced Prince George is next. Nothing I need to ask you on the micro. Good morning. We have experienced Prince George's. Welcome Miss Graves, Miss Montero. I'll turn to Miss Hightower to get us started. Yes, chair. I will turn to Mister David Noto who is the budget and policy analyst and he will give a budget overview. He's new to the county so welcome. Good morning Chair Durnoga, vice chair Ivy, members of the PHED committee. My name is David Noto. I'm a member of the Office of Budget and Policy and I'll be presenting on experience Prince George's fiscal year 2025 proposed budget report. This budget can be found on page 190 of your virtual binder experience Prince George's is a 501 C six organization which serves as the main tourism and advertising agency for the county. It is funded primarily through an annual county contribution which totals about 90% of their budget this year. Their proposed fiscal year 2025 2025 budget is 1.73 million, a decrease of $112,000, driven primarily by a decrease in state grant funds. The overall fiscal year 2025 county contribution to experience Prince George's is just over 1.55 million and remains unchanged from fiscal year 2024. The county's contribution is comprised of a general fund grant of about 900 196,000, a decrease of about 94,000 from the previous fiscal year and a 5% allocation of the hotel motel tax in accordance with CB 77 2016 experience Prince George's expected proceeds from the hotel motel tax for fiscal year 2025 will exceed the approved 2024 budget level by about $94,000, hence the corresponding decrease in the county's grant. Experienced Prince George also receives funding from the state tourism board, membership dues and fundraising. Their compensation fringe benefits are proposed to decrease to align with anticipated costs and planned salary adjustments. The chart on page four of the report is an itemized list of operating and marketing expenditures. You will find that the marketing budget is projected to decrease slightly while the operating budget is projected to increase, mostly due to an expansion in the consultants, contracts and insurance field because of the execution of a feasibility study which is anticipated to be completed before the end of fiscal year 2025. Staff has proposed to remain constant from the prior fiscal year with six full time employees and one part time employee. Among their major accomplishments from this past fiscal year include a marketing campaign in key feeder markets from North Carolina to New York, an increase in the number of hospitality organizations becoming members of experienced Prince George's, and securing a new travel and tourism data collection tool that tracks visitors spending in the county. The final charts on page seven of the report show some of experience Prince George's performance metrics over the past five fiscal years, all of which show a steady increase in county tourism and travel as we continue to rebound from the pandemic. Thank you. This concludes my remarks and if you have any questions, let me know. Any questions for Mister Nodo? No, thank you. You're good. Miss Skinner. No questions. Thank you. Mister early, anything? Just to add just one item, Mister chair. One of the things that I know will be discussed is being able to support movie development and so forth. So just to make sure you have awareness of it. Outside of this organization's budget from Annapolis, there is about $5 million for a facility, a former school, to be made available for theatrical development for capital investment. That's it interesting. Thank you. I'll turn to miss Graves. That would affect Rhonda. That was thinking. It would affect both of you. I thought it would affect you also, but maybe it doesn't. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mister early is full of surprises today. Okay, Miss Graves, microphone on. I will definitely call Rhonda and work on that. Good morning, committee, and thank you all for having me come over and invite a guest to the committee. So I just want to say, you know, since the last time we met, there has been some positive movement with the travel and tourism industry across the country, and specifically in Prince George's county. We have increased our numbers back to hotel tax collections. Prior to 2019, we were up to about 37. 7 million just in hotel taxes. That gets us back to where we were prior, in fact, a little bit higher. Our employment has started to come back on tasks. We are about 16% of the state's employment numbers.

That gets us back to where we were prior, in fact, a little bit higher. Our employment has started to come back on tasks. We are about 16% of the state's employment numbers. About 30,000 plus people in this county are working in the industry. That's really important. We know sort of who those big agencies are, right? Whether they be MGM or a gaylord or commanders, quite frankly, they're all high employees. Employee numbers. And then when you start to look at all the individual spaces collectively, we're actually doing really well in that space. And those numbers are not created by me. Those are created at the state level through an organization called tourism economics. Every jurisdiction that has a conference of visitors BuREAU pays in. So we get that data. It's where all of our visitor data comes from. Just so everyone knows that the other thing that's been going on, I just. I know. We got asked this question, I believe, by councilmember Hawkins a couple of times, is about the types of business that we're bringing into the county ourselves. So I wanted to touch on that a little bit. We have certainly put our foot on the gas as it relates to going to trade shows that we believe are the right types of shows to get the businesses we want. We are a small destination. As much as we love Prince George's county as it relates to the travel and tourism world and planners, we are a very small microcosm because of that. We have partnered with Montgomery county, with Baltimore, with Arundel county, and we are actually working collectively to bring conventions to our region. We call ourselves meet in Maryland, Maryland Capital Region specifically, but all important ways to leverage where we are with our budget and our need to promote our county at the level that we know we should be able to. So as part of that, I just wanted to say very quickly, let me pull it up on my phone. I apologize. We have in the past year attended about 15 conventions. All of those conventions are driven by appointments. So these are not random standing there and just hand somebody a tchotchke that says experience. Prince, Georgia. They're, as you guys know, going to ICSC. They're appointment driven meetings. And out of those, we have been able to confirm Christians United for Christ. And getting into the religious market is really a value to us. It is a huge market. In fact, FedEx Field used to host a Jehovah witness conference. If you guys have any history of that, that is a huge piece of business. I'm working with the commanders now to provide them leads and get this management group and this ownership group on board to understand that in their off season, the building is just a wonderfully unique venue to put conferences and meetings in. Corporate, small, religion and so on, who are talking with them about that. Outside of that particular meeting? We also have a telecommunications industry association meeting, an AltruSa meeting, which is an environmental group that is largely hispanic. And they will be coming up into our college park area. These are all booked between 24 and 25. By the way, Music Maryland Educators is association and a large construction materials company. These are driven directly by us. We don't own any Assets in the county. We don't set Any Rates. We don't block any availability. What that requires is for my office and my team to partner with all of those who have those. So, for the Record, I'd like to point out that we have sent approximately 20 solid leads to the Gaylord for probably about 30, $40 million, all of which they have declined. I say that because I want you guys to understand how the dynamic of the relationship works. They have a sales team. I have a sales team. We created an environment that we work very closely together. But it is very difficult for me to sell a building that has hired staff to sell it. And again, I don't set the Rates. I don't control the availability. So if they tell me the space isn't available or no, I'm not interested in that particular lead. A lead is just a piece of business that wants to come here, then we can't do anything with that. And that's across the board. And the Gaylord is our 1997 room hotel, and it's where we struggle the most to put business. So all of these pieces of business that I'm talking to you about will not go down there. We put them in other places in the county because we know that the county is a very viable place whether you're in College park, whether you're in Bowie, you know, Largo is booming and we are, we'll talk about that in a second. But as we continue to work with them, you know, we will continue to present them with business is the Point. We do a lot of Travel with the national harbor team. They also are with the CVB. So welcome to my WOrld. But we do a lot of Co oping together to keep our costs down for trade shows. So the shows that make sense for us to go to, we go to together and sell the county together. We do that also with College park. And importantly, we do that through an organization called Team Maryland, which is how we sell sports. And that's how we get to trade shows that are sports driven. You guys all probably know that the county i", "esg_v1": null, "esg_v2": null, "chunk_start_time": 3090694, "chunk_end_time": 3495966, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3481?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3481?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=3090"}, {"start": 44000, "end": 50000, "text": ", and it's where we struggle the most to put business.

You guys all probably know that the county is, is really on fire with sports right now. Whether they be at the JTCC, whether they be in the gaylord, whether they be at Liberty Sports park or one of the many park and planning facilities. We've got a lot of new activities coming that hadn't been here before. And our role with those is really to make sure that the participants have hotel rooms. Right. And that they know where the venues are, they could be hosting. So we are in that space as well. And a couple of other things I just wanted to point out is that we have also, I think I brought this to your attention last year, but we have begun to participate in something called, you may be familiar with this, as you may also councilmember Ivy Cruze, which is our capital region USA. If you know anything about DC, you know, DC promotes itself around the world, has offices around the world. Cruza is a major way that that happens. We, along with our counterparts over in Annapolis have also joined Cruza. That is a $10,000 membership. But what it has allowed is for trade shows that are happening in France and in Germany and in the UK to see Prince George's county. So we are present. And because of that, we just last month, two months ago, I can't recall call right now, hosted a familiarization tour with eleven group tour operators from the second largest tour operator group in Europe. They obviously see our bright shining star, which is the harbor, which we're great with. So we came together with our harbor partners and we provided them an experience for a couple of days. Unfortunately, it was one of our stormy weekends. But you know what? The harbor is even cool in the storm. So they, they enjoyed that. We had a good time and we expect that groups will start to be booked behind that. So that is sort of us in a nutshell. Right now, I'm available to answer any questions you guys might have. And I. Was I supposed to say my name and all that stuff? Okay, thank you. I think I said in his graves. Oh, you did, you did. Thank you. Thank you. Mister Hawkins, any questions? Mister Franklin, did you have any questions? You got to call him again. Okay, thank you. He's recognizing how hard it is. Miss Watson, just one quick question. In regards to any feedback from residents or businesses on customer service, from the businesses specifically, like in the harbor, do you get any feedback on that? Yes. Yes. Let me say it to you this way. I think what you consider to be maybe the customer is different than what I'm considering to be the customer, or maybe not. So when I think of the customer, I think of the planner. When I think of the customer, I think of the client. That's who my customer is. So my customer is the person who said, yes, I'm going to sign this contract and I'm going to bring this piece of business to your county. Let's say it's the aks that are coming and they happen to book their business down at the harbor. What will happen is folks begin to realize, as they're trying to work through their plan, that there are separate entities down at the harbor. And although there is a board, they don't always sing off the same hymnal. And so I get the call to sort of fix it. And so, yes, so, by example, there used to be a huge challenge with business that would get booked in the gaylord and no one in the harbor would know it. So the restaurants weren't prepared. So if you have 10,000 people, people coming in a four or five day window, and you haven't told anybody, how does that work for us? So, yes, you know, do I get residential complaints about customer service? I think that. Not so much me. I think those might be more of what the hotel hears itself or the restaurant managers. That doesn't necessarily come back to me, although we intuitively know it. It's a McDonald's model versus a chick fil. A model. Right, right. I just didn't. I mean, I didn't want it to be a barrier to having businesses come and experience Pritchard George's. I've just, you know, it's just something that I've been hearing, so just want to make sure. Yeah, I, you know, I think it's an excellent point. I was. I just left our CEO meeting in Boston. In Boston was hosting all of us from every DMO across the country, but also 15 countries around the world were there and customer service was a discussion. It's everywhere that it's a problem. I think we all continue to fight through it and what we try to do, to be very honest with you, is just put our best foot forward in the role that we play and to make sure that they feel serviced and they feel supported because of the planner feels good about it, you know? Or if the planner doesn't feel good and comes back and says to us, hey, look, we had a, there wasn't enough food. Then it becomes a conversation when I'm sitting with my board, which is inclusive of Gaylord, to say, we've got to figure this out. So we do try to come in on the back end to fix it so that the planner has a better experience and wants to book that second contract. Okay.

Thank you all and have a wonderful week. You too. So redevelopment authority is next. Thank you, Leslie. Thank you all. Have a great day. It okay. We have the redevelopment authority with us now and we have a new executive director. I'll turn to Miss Hightower to get us started. Yes, sir. I would like to turn to miss y to give an overview of the redevelopment authority's budget followed by Director Spencer west giving a PowerPoint presentation and talking with the committee. Thank you. Good morning again. As you know. Well, good morning, committee. As you know, my name is Shailene Miller y and I am with the budget and policy analyst division. I will be providing you an overview of the redevelopment authority. I want to thank the redevelopment authority in no one be for the information they provided that is included in this report. All information will be summarized and further details can be found in the report and the responses. The report is on page 220 of your virtual binder. The fiscal year 2025 proposed operating budget for the redevelopment authority is 523,900, a decrease of 10,600 or 2% from the fiscal year 2024 approved budget. The county's grant is $300,000, a decrease of 10,600. CB 61 2023. The RVA has assumed responsibility of the county's surplus property through the property Management Services Special Revenue Fund previously managed by the Office of Central Services. Proposed budget for the property managed special revenue Fund is $567,000, a decrease of $233,000 at 29.1%. This is due to the removal of a recovery for a realty specialist 3g position. The proposed operating budget for the RDA is 1,090,900 $567,000 above the fiscal year 2024 budget. Regarding staffing d HCD will soon fill the r1 estate development vacancy, which will focus on surplus. Only one employee currently works on the pathways of purchase program, but the RDA can increase this through contracting efforts necessary in terms of expenditures from the general fund located on page three of the report, all changes are anticipated or due to a reduction of needs. The increase in commercial insurance is due to an increase in coverage and professional legal services were funded by the surplus fund. Regarding revenue for the special revenue fund, property sales are down $600,000 due to the Office of Central Services seizing activities administratively. The Office of Central Services is still managing the county's property, but the RDA is working with the office regarding the list of properties through the surplus disposition process related to expenditures. Of the special revenue Fund, 133,300 is being reduced due to the removal of the recovery for a royalty specialist 3g position and 102,700 is being reduced for landscaping services, which was a one time cost from fiscal year 2024. In terms of program impact for fiscal year 2024, the RDA estimates that it will assist 33 individuals with the down payment or closing cost assistance through pathways to purchase in partnership with the Maryland Mortgage program. So, in partnership with the Maryland Mortgage program, the pathways to purchase guidelines increase downpayment assistance from ten thousand dollars to twenty five thousand dollars as well as expenses expanded the participating lenders pool in fiscal year 2024, the RDA accomplished many of their goals which are outlined on page five of the report, but as a summary, they were able to continue phases of the Glendarden Hills project, which is projected to be completed at the end of fiscal year 2024. They have continued ongoing pre development activities with a number of projects including the Chevrolet Hospital, and have gauged have engaged in planning efforts related to the Highestfield Justice center in aviation landing. Through H VAC, they have issued 13 home repair loans totaling totaling 739,000 and currently have a pipeline of ten loans through the Community Impact grant program. They have awarded three nonprofits in fiscal year 2024 totaling $75,000 with $200,000 expected in spring 2024. Through the commercially commercial Property Improvement program. They are currently reviewing notice of funding applications totaling $600,000 from fiscal year 2023 and for fiscal year 2024 there is funding totaling 1 million to be issued in spring 2024. In fiscal year 25, they plan to focus on redeveloping the former hospital site in Cheverly, developing the College Park Metro aviation site, developing the town square at Suitland Federal center project and other redevelopment activities with the Blue Line corridor. The only challenge that the RDA has expressed is increasing participation in the pathways to purchase program due to the lack of affordable home ownership available. Lastly, on the CIP, for fiscal year 2025, 43.7% of the RDAs funding is from land sales, county contributions and moral obligation bonds, and 56.3% is from the state. The RDA holds six projects totaling a budget of 22,376,000.

And that is all. Thank you very much. I'll turn to miss Skinner in case she has anything for us. No, sir, nothing. In addition to that mister early. Nothing, mister chair. Thank you. Okay, we'll go to miss west spencer. Welcome. Thank you. Good morning. And miss Miller y actually gave my whole presentation. Okay. Motion to adjourn. But I thank you for this opportunity. I appreciate it. I've been with the RDA now almost six months. So it's been an amazing opportunity with a great team, great staff, and we're anxious to do some, continue to do some great work here in the county. So first, I just wanted to re acclimate everyone. Okay, down, down. Thank you. Just to re acclimate everyone with the mission of the RDA, which is to develop, redevelop, revitalize and preserve communities by decreasing the number of blighted properties and improving the quality of life for residents in prince George's county. We do this with our core services of real estate development, community revitalization, which consists of our commercial property improvement program, our Community Impact grant program, Pathways to purchase assistance program in collaboration in partnership with DHCD, as well as our housing rehabilitation assistance program, again in participation with DHCD, and newly our surplus property disposition program. We have a staff of ten people, which includes those positions that are funded by DHCD. And we have one vacancy. Our real estate development pipeline is very extensive. We have over 2900 units of housing, residential housing, that is in the pipeline that will be developed over the next decade. This does not include all of our projects. There are some projects that are still in their concept envisioning. So this pipeline will continue to grow. Our community revitalization programs, our commercial property improvement program. As Miss Miller explained, we're going to be issuing our FY 2024 NOFA for $1 million in this summer for our Community Impact grant program. We're actually going to be announcing around later this month and it's for $200,000 again in our community revitalization. Just to recap on our partnership with DHCD, our pathways to purchase program, this is our down payment assistance. So far we've had great traction with an increase in down payment assistance to 25,000 per home. One thing just to mention and to look at in terms of the purchase prices, we're looking at $432,000 for existing property and $467,000 for new construction. Finding homes within Prince George's county that fit within those limits are challenging, but we are getting a lot of traction now in closing some loans. Our housing rehabilitation assistance program. This is administered in partnership with Housing initiative programs. It is a homeowner repair program. There are some funds that have been set aside for the blue line corridor which actually are just about to be expended. This assistance program is for households owning up to 80% of AMI, and it is a great program that has been actively utilized. And then finally, our surplus property disposition program. Since this is new to us and as part of what council approved last year as part of CB 61 2023, we just want to take the time to identify just the four phases of surplus that we're going to be processing for on behalf of the RDA. So the first piece is identifying potential county owned properties for disposition. This should be done traditionally by homeowners and property owners who are interested in purchasing land, as well as looking at a very taking a comprehensive approach to looking at land disposition. What are properties that we should be looking at in relationship to our partnership agencies? Whether it's DHCD, the revenue authority, and park and planning, there may be some special properties that we can look at for special disposition to meet the needs of the county that we're going to be focusing on. So park and planning has been a great partner to us in looking at the county's inventory and seeing what could potentially be surplus for special disposition. Yes, sir. I think we're supposed to get an inventory by May 1. And in the past, in certain years, the office of Central Services would meet with council members or go over, send us the list, maybe in advance, the draft list, and just go over it with us individually. I don't know if anyone explained or suggested that to you, but that's usually been helpful. Sure. And OCS is working on that delivery of the inventory list. So we will come in when it's time for the surplus disposition or identifying those properties that are available for surplus. Right. But just to be clear, it's a two step process. There's an inventory of everything in the world, and then there's the list of items that might be surplus or could be surplus. That's correct. Okay. So thank you, chair.

There's an inventory of everything in the world, and then there's the list of items that might be surplus or could be surplus. That's correct. Okay. So thank you, chair. Done for explaining that. The second part. So once there's a five part, let's add five phases to surplus. So it's first identifying what the county inventory is and then identifying those properties that would be designated as surplus and then submitting to council what the surplus legislation would look like. And then after community engagement meetings and so forth, we would have a plan of disposition that would be submitted for council approval, and then the strategic disposition of the surplus properties. Now, our operating budget, I'm actually going to skip over this since Miss Miller y had gone through this and are just explaining what our operating budget is and how it was increased to a million dollars. There's our RDA operating funds as well as those funds that have been transferred from property management special revenue funds. So I'm just going to skip over this just to save some time. Our pros capital improvement program. So I'm going to go over our different capital program information. Just let you understand what are we spending our resources on in our time. So the Addison Road Capital Heights metro corridor is currently funding the Fairmont Heights net zero Homes and Microgrid. That's a new construction of six net zero homes that are currently under construction. In addition, it's the planning and pre development of Addison park, which is 246 senior apartments, which, if you look at this screen, it's identified. The senior apartments are the first phase of that redevelopment at D and F, as well as the mission of love property that will be developed in Site B and then future development of townhomes or single family homes that would be closer to Yolanda Avenue in site G and G. This also includes, includes 210 on the park, 158 residential units that we're hoping to work with the developer and start construction this calendar year. We have the Cheverly Hospital redevelopment, which will produce over 1300 units of housing as well as mixed retail amenities serving retail spaces. Senior housing, townhouses for sale. So a very intensive project, but it's great. Chair Ivy has been a part, part of our communication with the town of Chevrolet and this is such an amazing project. Again, this is on Hospital Hill and so it's definitely a project that will take at least a decade to complete. And so just to make sure everyone is aware of how long the time commitment would be for this project. So far we've received $22.5 million from the state and grants in order to facilitate the infrastructure and pre development work on this project. Then under our county revitalization CIP. We have the Hyattsville Justice center, aviation landing in our county revitalization funds includes our community property improvement program, our surplus property disposition program. Beacon Heights Purple Line development. That is a project that we're also restarting with the developer. At the Beacon Heights Purple Line train station, we have the Glen Arden Apartments redevelopment. We've completed 114 senior units as well as 55 family units, 158 family units. And we are under construction right now for 97 for sale townhomes. Then we have Suitland manor, which I like to say town Square. It's Suitland Federal center. It's the name of the development and it's a labor of love. And it was the founding project, from what I understand, of the RDA. And it has been under construction redevelopment for some time now. We've completed over 219 townhomes. We've completed 137 unit senior building. There's still infrastructure work that is being completed, including building the site, the street grid, and so forth. Currently, the RDA is updating our market analysis for our hotel and retail space. That is also critical at the corner of Suitland Road and Silver Hill Road. And then I'm actually just going to come right through this because Miss Miller y already explained this just in terms of where we are for our targets. Our first goal is on developed mixed use income housing and infill development. So we're planning on completing 158 units in 2024 and potentially 516 units in 2025. And then our second goal is promoting revitalization and quality life through our homeownership program. So this is our pathways to purchase program. And again, we are picking up some speed on this and have a great team that's focusing on the opportunities. And with the $25,000 in partnership with Maryland mortgage program, we are really seeing some increase in activity with the pathways to purchase program. So that is it. Thank you very much. I'll look for questions. Miss Ivy, do you have anything? But I think you can't wait. True. I can't wait because I actually need to leave in a few minutes. So I almost forgot that. Okay. I did want to go to your pathways to purchase. You said that one problem that you're having is available homes at that level, 432,000 being the upper limit. For example, 467,000 for new construction.

So I understand why that would be really challenging for new construction. But for there are homes, it just depends on the neighborhood, right? That's right. And one of our sons bought a home in Chapel Oaks, and it was significantly under $432,000. So it is possible I think to find these homes. I don't know how it. I don't know. Do you work with realtors? We do. We do. And I think one of the things that we're going to be focusing on this year is our outreach and making sure that folks are aware of the programs. We do need to do some outreach to the lenders that are actually participating. Lenders as part of the Maryland mortgage program. As well as doing some additional outreach to the community organizations. We have our typical community organizations that we've been working with historically. But our focus is getting the word out because there is money to be used in this program. And so we're exploring different ways that we can get the information out. If you have community fairs programs. Anything that you would want us to participate in. We'd be more than happy to participate. Okay. Great. And the Fairmont Heights projects in my district. So I've been trying to pay attention to that a little bit. I don't remember what the income level is for. That seems like like 80,000. It should be 80% of Ami. But I need to get back to you on that. Which is how much money? 80% of AMI is around 80,000 or a little less than that. It should be. Let me get back to you on that. Because my math skills have never been very sharp. Not ever since I missed when everybody was learning long division in third grade. So in any event. Chevrolet is obviously a huge project of ours. And there's. I'm sure you know there's been a lot of discussion within the community. And I live there. So I get to be part of it whether I want to be or not about the importance of connecting the road between the site and Cheverly proper. And a lot of that too has to do with whether or not this site is going to truly become part of Cheverly. Because we call it Cheverly. But right now it's not within the municipality. So I do want to. Not at this meeting but figure out when might be the proper time to do such a thing. Because I think that's going to smooth a lot of things. If it's truly part of Cheverly and for people to understand the difference in what kind of retail can come there. 40,000 sqft isn't a lot. That's been one complaint because that's one reason why the town wants it in the first place is try to have some kind of retail. We really are under retailed in that area. Yeah. Yeah. We want to annex it. I mean we. Meaning as a resident, I will say that, and I do support that as a council member. But as far as the amount and the kind of retail, I think that's going to directly be impacted by whether or not that road is there that connects. And I'm not sure that people completely understand what the impact could be. I believe that there is support overall with connecting, but there is. We definitely hear from people who are unhappy about it. And given the timeline for the whole project, people who are concerned about overcrowded streets for their couple of streets. That would be the connectors. Those kids will be in college by the time this is completely open. So I try to explain that too, but people don't want to hear it. And there's also concerns just to kind of let you know about the amount of rental properties that will be in here. Cheverly is primarily owner, you know, people who live in the homes that they own, not rentals. And we do have some apartment buildings. They're out on 202, but for the most part, it's single family homes that are owned by the residents who live there. And the people feel like that's got a direct impact on keeping the neighborhood with a certain character. So just to let you know that obviously we need apartment buildings because we need places for people to live. But just for you to keep that in mind for, like, you have a whole section of active adult rental units, there are, I'm sure, pretty a lot of people who would be willing to buy those, too. People who currently live in the town, who are not going to be able to continue living in their homes, you know, as they get older. There are only 48 condos for them. Not even them anymore. Heck, I'm 62. That could be me in a couple years. So in any event, I just wanted to touch base on that and just to let you know what people are thinking in the town. And I don't know how involved you are at this point, because the developer has been doing a lot of the work. But where are we with the food hall and the helipad and those kind of projects? Are you part of that? We are part of those conversations. But specifically regarding the food hall and helipad, I don't know that we're up to that.

That is a priority of the development team. Because they can't design the retail space unless they know that there's a pathway that connects the development to the community. So I'll put that on a list for us to follow up with the development team. We're part of all the meetings and coordinating with them. And again, the focus has really just primarily been on how the street grid will look at the Chevrolet hospital. And hopefully that it could be opened up to the community. Right. Because if those roads aren't connected, then perhaps it would be more townhouses across that stretch does change potentially the planning for the site. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mister Hawkins, I was instructed to request of you to have a meeting offline. Be virtual, because I want to ask about Chevrolet, but I want to ask about when the development team that was awarded that RFP or whatever they announced. A group of minority investors. And I haven't seen any indication of where they involved. So I want to talk with you. And I also want to talk to you about Maryland 210. But I have eight questions. I'll hit you offline and we can talk about them there. Thank you Mister chair. Thank you. Thank you. Mister Franklin has a question or two. Can we put Mister Franklin up so we can see him? There he is. Mister Franklin wants to know about the status of the commercial component of the town square project. Sure. So I'll answer that first. Right now we have. We're going to be starting the construction on the retail kiosks, which is 4000 space that is to be developed. We're working on some permitting, zoning approvals at this time. But we're hoping to start construction that would provide opportunity for at a minimum of two retailers that could share that kiosk space, whether it's pop up space. And so our goal is to engage and commercial broker in order to identify a pipeline of potential tenants for that space. And then the other commercial space that is being discussed, which is not within our purview, is with the revenue authority for their site. Where there's multifamily mixed and commercial development, retail development that would be built on their site, which is block a and b. And then there's the future redevelopment site of block K. Excuse me. Which is going to be the final site of redevelopment, which will have some commercial retail activities on site. So the first would be the retail kiosks, which we should be starting construction this year. Okay. Mister Franklin's follow up question was he understood those active bidding process that the private sector responded to, but was canceled. So he's wondering why was it canceled and will it be restarted? And I'm assuming that's for the hotel retail component. He says there's a revenue authority. I can't speak to that since I'm the redevelopment authority. We were not part of that. Gotcha. Okay. I'll ask Mister Franklin if that's sufficient or if he has a follow up question. He's good. Okay. He's good. All your projects are far from my district. Which is good in the sense of their smart growth inside the beltway. So pleased to see that. Sure. Yet. We'll give you two. No, I'm going to ask my questions when I meet with her. What's going on with the redevelopment of Bowie State? That is under the revenue authority. Oh, okay. Thank you. That's why council member Watson didn't ask her. Because she knows. Under the revenue authority. Missouriato just wants you to know that she sent an email with questions, wants to meet with you offline. Okay, we'll follow up. I think we're good. Anything else? Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. I'll look to Mr. Hawkins for a motion to adjourn. Mr. Chair, I move that we adjourn. Second, any discussion seeing none other than favor, raise your hand.

Proposed minor amendment to the 1989 Master Plan and sectional map amendment for the Langley Park College Park Greenbelt and Vicinity area and proposed sectional map amendment. Cr zero zero 120 24. Digest of testimony. I see that there is some language I missed before which I will add here. This public meeting is part of an ongoing process to consider and approve proposed minor amendment to the 1989 Master plan and sectional map amendment for the Langley Park College Park Greenbelt and Vicinity area and proposed sectional map amendment with certain specific zoning classification proposals. The council's discussion of potential action on the minor amendment to the 1989 Master Plan and sectional map amendment for the Langley Park College Park Greenbelt and Vicinity area may include, but is not limited to, whether the council shall make changes to the recommendations of the planning board in approving the endorsed sectional map amendment. And we will now go to Kiera McClung. McCune? You speak McCune? McCune. Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, chair Ivey, members of the council, again, for the record, my name is Kier McCune. I am the project facilitator for the proposed minor plan amendment and concurrent sectional map amendment for the 1989 Langley Park College Park Green Belt and vicinity master plan. Emily Lutz, who is the project manager, could not attend today. She's taking a well earned vacation. During today's work session, I'll provide an overview of the project, summarize the little bit of testimony we received that was put into the record, discuss the minor plan amendment staff report and Planning Board's action from their April 25 work session and review the project ", "esg_v1": null, "esg_v2": null, "chunk_start_time": 4240, "chunk_end_time": 392604, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3588?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3588?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=4"}, {"start": 4000, "end": 10000, "text": "nal map amendment for the Langley Park College Park Greenbelt and Vicinity area may include, but is not limited to, whether the council shall make changes to the recommendations of the planning board in approving the endorsed sectional map amendment.

Emily Lutz, who is the project manager, could not attend today. She's taking a well earned vacation. During today's work session, I'll provide an overview of the project, summarize the little bit of testimony we received that was put into the record, discuss the minor plan amendment staff report and Planning Board's action from their April 25 work session and review the project schedule and end with any questions that you have for us. As stated earlier, the proposed minor plan amendment are for the 1990, excuse me, 1989 Langley Park College Park Greenville vicinity master Plan. And from here on out in this presentation, I'll just refer to it as a 1989 master plan. The boundary for the plan is highlighted in pink on the slide. The plan boundary is in the northern part of the county covering planning areas 65, 66 and 67, and includes areas in College Park, Greenbelt and Berwyn Heights. This minor plan amendment and SMA focuses on a group of CGO zone properties encompassing about 1.4 acres on Bruin Road in College park. The primary uses for these properties include retail, a restaurant, personal services that are all located in the heart of a single family neighborhood. The proposed amendments do not fundamentally change the goals and objectives of the master plan, but instead make modifications to update commercial neighborhood development patterns and to provide for context sensitive infill development. Additionally, the 1989 master plan is based upon growth concepts from the 1989 General Plan, which refers to areas of concentrated development as centers. These 1982 general plan center classifications are no longer recognized. However, they are still areas of importance within the plan boundary as to not create confusion with plan 2035 centers. The proposed amendments have replaced all plan references from the term centers to focus areas and proposes to rezone the subject properties from the CGO zone to the CN zone. At the hearing, one speaker testified and four written statements of testimony were received to the clerk by the close of the record, which was on April 3. The record included letters from the city of Greenbelt and the Berwyn District Civic association on behalf of area residents. All testimony was either in support of the minor plan amendment and SMA or provided general comments about the plan. Staff reviewed and evaluated the proposed minor plan amendment for conformance to the requirements of section 2735.02 I of the Zoning Ordinance, which are the rules and procedures for initiating, developing and the approval of a minor plan amendment. Staff found the proposed minor amendments, as drafted in CR 120 24, meet the requirements of the zoning ordinance. On April 25, the planning board voted unanimously to adopt the minor amendments for the 1989 master plan and to endorse the recommended approval of the sectional map amendment. Both the minor plan amendment and sectional map amendment were initiated in January. We held a joint public hearing. In March, the planning board held their work session and acted to adopt the minor plan amendment and endorse the SMA in April. And then today we're having our work session that will lead potentially to an adoption in June. So I try to be brief and that concludes my presentation and happy to answer any questions that you have. Thank you very much and thanks to the staff for their quick work on this. I know it wasn't a large area, but still is work, and so I really appreciate that. I think you did mention the city of Greenbelt sent a letter, but I believe that was city of College Park, I think. But that's. Yeah, I probably disagreed with that, but yes, you're right. Okay, that's fine. That's fine. Okay. Thank you. Madam chair, would you like to make a motion? Would you like to make a motion? Yes, I would like to move for the preparation of document of approval consistent with the planning board. Second, I have a motion by council member Olson. Second, by council member Drunogo. Please call the roll chair. Ivey? Aye. Miss Plaget? Aye. Mister Burrows? Aye. Mister Danoga? Aye. Miss Fisher? Aye. Mister Olson? Aye. Miss Oyeda? Miss Watson. Aye. Motion carries 80. Next, we have CB 16, 2024, an act concerning late night business safety plan for the purpose of requiring certain businesses that operate between 10:00 p.m. and 06:00 a.m. to obtain a late night safety plan from the office of the county executive or their designee. That requires the business to obtain an approved late night safety plan before operating. That the business must operate under the terms of the approved late night safety plan. That an approved late night safety plan authorizes the business to operate for three years. That at the expiration of the three year period, the business will need to obtain a new approved late night safety plan and that businesses operating without an approved late night safety plan are subject to an civil fine for each day it operates without an approved late night safety plan. This is sponsored by council members Orietta and Fisher. And I'll turn now to Nathaniel Tutt. Where is he? Oh, there you are. Good afternoon, madam chair.

Sorry, I should have noticed that earlier today. As you noted, CB 16 is an act concerning late night business safety plans, requiring businesses that operate between 10:00 p.m. and 06:00 a.m. to obtain a late night safety plan. The legislation was presented originally on March 12, and it was discharged from the GOFP committee on April 3 30th of this year. As noted, the legislation would be enacted for three years, and I wanted to bring your attention to the policy analysis statement, which is in your packet, and you'll note that on page six. There are a number of framing questions for your consideration today, and it notes that enactment of CB 16 is likely to have an adverse fiscal impact on the county in the form of additional expenditures related to additional staffing requirements associated with implementing and enforcing provisions of the bill. Also, the bill does not outline an amount to be appropriated to the grant program. The grant program is used solely to offset the cost of implementing any approved or recommended late night business safety plan, and any county funds appropriated to and awarded from the grant program would be an additional expenditure to the county. And with that, I should point out that staff is here. Mister Malcolm Moody, who wrote the report, is here if you have any additional questions. Thank you, madam chair. Thank you. See, we have Terry Bell here. Would you like to speak about the legality of the bill? Thank you, Madam Chair, the office of law has had the opportunity to review CV 16 and we found it to be legally sufficient. Secenda Skinner from the county execs office. Good afternoon, madam Chair. Thank you. I've had an opportunity to speak with the sponsors on this bill for CB 16. Councilmember Oriata and councilmember Fisher. We are asking, and I'm not sure where the chair, the council members are regarding this legislation, but we believe it is reasonable to ask to hold this legislation at this juncture. I do understand it was deferred out of GOFP and brought here before the cow because it includes or involves several agencies. I've had a preliminary discussion with director early with OMB. I still need to have conversations with PGPD and DPI regarding this legislation, so we're asking to hold it. As Mister Tutt indicated, there are at least six questions that we do think also assist in the discussion. So that needs to take place to determine if this legislation, if there are any amendments, or if there's some more work that needs to be taken before we can actually give an official position. Councilmember Orieta. Councilmember Fisher, thank you. Just for kind of a summary of the reason and intent behind the legislation for my colleagues. As we've all seen, sadly a lot of establishments that are open late, we had a high number of like carjackings, murders, robberies, and as we've been discussing as a body, trying to think about ways in which we can supply one, our police department with as many resources as possible, and then also making sure that our businesses are part of the solution. So the hope with this legislation is that it does that, that it creates that conversation between our police department and these businesses around what safety measures could look like. It also intentionally tries not to be too prescriptive because we know that each business might need something different. So that's why instead of it regulating, each of them need to have this type of security camera, or this need to have on site security, et cetera. It creates this space for that to be evaluated business by business. And we hope that's a tool. Other jurisdictions have passed similar legislation or are working on similar legislation, so I think this is just something we can add to our toolbox. I will also say that I've had the opportunity to meet with some different lobbyists from the industry side to think about possible amendments to the legislation. So I have do have some things for us to look at and consider. I'm not sure if right now is the time I should share that with the committee or if my colleague wanted to say something first. Thank you, Councilmember Oriada. I think, I think there's a lot more to consider and work out on this bill. So I think would be appropriate for us to hold it and have our two offices meet with our stakeholders and get to a better place with it. That's where. Those are my comments. I hear what you are saying. We are going to hear from the people who signed up, so we'll consider what to do after we hear from them. Mike, before I do that, are there any questions from committee members from the council? Committee? No. Okay. Mike O'Halloran, Kirk McCauley, then Sarah Price. Good afternoon, madam chair, members of the, of the council. For the record, my name is Mike O'Halloran, here representing the Mid Atlantic Petroleum Distributors association. So our members constitute service stations, convenience stores in and around the county. You look for those members that were not around back in 2013. The council did pass a very prescriptive law impacting the convenience store industry.

So our members constitute service stations, convenience stores in and around the county. You look for those members that were not around back in 2013. The council did pass a very prescriptive law impacting the convenience store industry. Among the requirements of this law is to have a special registration with the Department of permitting, inspection and enforcement. We must provide safety training to all new employees. The training is then reviewed for adequacy by the police department. Includes handling cash, what to do in the event of a robbery, etcetera. We also must post a copy of a trespass affidavit that's visible to the public. The law also governs how much cash we can have on hand between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 06:00 a.m. it also mandates surveillance cameras at our locations, access to those cameras to law enforcement. The point of all this is to say that as far as our industry is concerned, this new bill is very duplicative. In addition, it may require our locations to hire safety, excuse me, security personnel, and added cost of those locations in addition to the compliance costs that we already incur for this 2013 law. So in that regard, we do oppose the bill that's drafted. Certainly welcome any conversations with the sponsors, but at this point, we do see it as duplicative. Thank you. Thank you. Kirk McCauley, chair, council members, my name is Kirk McCauley and I represent service stations, convenience stores in Prince George's county. Individual sole owners and other individuals that operate them more or less dip in on what Michael Halloran just said. We already, under these regulations from the 2013 bill. As far as the regulations being similar to, like, Montgomery county, they say it's not really in Montgomery county. It has to be different criteria for who falls under the regulations, they have to have seating inside, inside vendors, the locations that do not have, that are not included in the bill. As far as the security goes, we meet everything in this bill with the exception of a possible security guard. And truthfully, at $50 an hour, a business would be losing money every night it's open, so that's kind of prohibitive. But we do meet all the other requirements of this bill, and that's about it. There's one other thing in the bill that's kind of as bad as a business. The bathrooms, outside bathrooms are open all the time. All that's done is inviting homeless people, drug users inside and destroying the bathrooms that are there for people that, that are customers. It would actually create a dangerous situation. So thank you, and we'll be happy to talk to any of the legislators about amendments, and we're always open for suggestions. Thank you. Thank you. Sarah Price, Douglas Murdoch and Brendan Mahoney. Thank you, madam chair. Good afternoon, honorable council members. I am Sarah Price, here on behalf of the Maryland Retailers alliance. Our membership includes, we are a statewide organization, including businesses of all shapes and sizes, including many grocery stores, pharmacies and convenience stores that could be impacted by this legislation. We do appreciate the intent to provide flexibility. We completely agree that one size fits all mandates don't exist. Having specific requirements for one business may not be applicable to another, but the way that this bill is drafted does leave a lot up in the air for businesses. It's unclear what other criteria might trigger certain requirements for some businesses, but not others. So we would appreciate maybe some more information or clarity within the bill so that businesses can understand what might be expected of them and what could potentially trigger more requirements at one business than another. I think everyone in this room has needed to go to a convenience store, a gas station, a grocery store or a pharmacy after 10:00 at night. The reason that these businesses are open late is to meet the needs of their community, and we want to make sure that they are still able to do that effectively while also protecting their customers and employees. We have made some recommendations to the council regarding amendments that could align this policy with the Montgomery county law should you choose to move forward with this proposal. We think that having consistency between the two jurisdictions would, frankly, make things a little bit easier for businesses, because if this does move forward, we want to make sure that it is as simple as possible for businesses to be compliant. So thank you for your consideration. Thank you. Doug Murdoch, Brendan Mahoney, then Kelly O'Brien. Good afternoon, madam chair and members of the council. I am Doug Murdoch, executive director for Mid Atlantic NATO, a regional affiliate of the National association of Theater Owners. And we're here to talk about CB Zero 1620 24 and the effect it would have on our theaters. We understand the intent for late night businesses, but we really are not late night. We're not 24 hours a day for most of the theaters. The box offices are well closed before 10:00 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights. Some of the theaters stay open as maybe 1030 11:00 and once they do that, they close their doors to the members of the public and let people watch the movies in privacy.

Some of the theaters stay open as maybe 1030 11:00 and once they do that, they close their doors to the members of the public and let people watch the movies in privacy. We also are very concerned about some of the parameters of the the May part of the bill, the flexibility. For instance, there may be a requirement for cameras on every single door. Well, these buildings are pretty large. So you take a big 16 screen complex, there may be 40 exterior doors. If you have to put a camera on the inside and outside of every single one, that's going to be a major expense to these theaters that are already struggling to stay alive. There are nine theaters in the county. There were ten a year ago, but Bowie had to close or was closed by one of the large circuits because it was having a financial trouble making ends meet. And so we ask for your consideration and exempting movie theaters entirely as we are really not open all night. And for those reasons, I thank you for your letting me speak. Thank you very much. Mister Murdoch. Oh, Christa Oreada has a question. Thank you for your testimony. I just wanted to get clarity on one of the points that you made about theaters and the closing time. Is there a reason why the way it's written, you believe it would be included currently in the draft? Because for intention sake, I'll say the intention is through the 10:00 p.m. to 06:00 a.m. but you're saying that you guys close at ten. So I just want to make sure I understood what that where y'all are following falling in. So all the theaters have different operating hours, but some of the major complexes may have later show times on a Friday Saturday night that may start as late as 1030. So therefore their box office and lobby are open. I will say that since the pandemic, many of the theaters were closing earlier just simply to make ends meet, attendances down and stuff. But at some point I'm sure that they'll come back and there will be some later shows seven days a week. But that if it at 10:00 p.m. we're still open till 10 30, 11:00 correct. But not open all the way till from ten to 06:00 a.m. no. Correct. Okay, thank you. Sure. Thank you. Brendan Mahoney, then Kelly O'Brien. Thank you, council. Good afternoon. Brendan Mahoney, representing the restaurant association of Maryland and our members here in Prince George's county, we repose this bill as currently drafted. I would refer the council to our written testimony that goes into much greater detail of some of our members comments and concerns on this legislation, as well as a few potential amendments that would improve the bill if the council ultimately decided to move forward. Firstly, we believe this bill is overly broad and would subject businesses who have not had a history of late night safety issues to unnecessary regulations and in turn would cause an immense financial burden for them. Even though some of the items, like hiring and training security personnel, which would be extremely costly, would require written justification from the department, it's unclear exactly what would trigger the department to recommend that. So we'd like to see that aspect more clearly defined in the bill. And we were rarely appreciative to see there was a grant program. But frankly, the grant program would do very little to offset these costs if funding wasn't provided year after year. Since many of the items that could be prescribed aren't a one time expense. We would also like to see the definition of business change to exclude drive thru and carry out only establishments. This is a key part of their current safety plan. It's very typical for fast food restaurants to close their lobby after a certain time of the night and operate drive thru only. Since you know many of them, their business model is transactional in nature. They only interact with the public very briefly, and typically problems don't arise. Finally, we'd like to see the timeframes altered to match Montgomery County's law, their law. In my written testimony, I go into greater detail of exactly what those hours would be. But a good example we found of why this would be necessary is it's very typical for coffee shops or diners to open up 05:00 a.m. to cater to commuters that are going to work, and we don't believe these establishments should be lumped in with other late night businesses. So with that, I thank the council for the opportunity to speak to we'd be more than happy to work with you. One of our fears if this bill passed as currently drafted, is that it would cause restaurants to close prematurely at 10:00 p.m. jeopardizing late night hospitality in Prince George's county. Thank you. Thank you. Kelly O'Brien. Hello. Good afternoon, madam chair and council members. My name is Kelly O'Brien. I'm owner of Jasper's restaurants, which is right there. And we are the late night in, late night hospitality. Just so everybody knows, we really, really try to provide as much security and safety as we can. We currently spend $250,000 a year off duty police officers because they are $50 an hour and it is very expensive. We have already taken on that cost years ago because, you know, our goal is to keep everybody safe.

And we are the late night in, late night hospitality. Just so everybody knows, we really, really try to provide as much security and safety as we can. We currently spend $250,000 a year off duty police officers because they are $50 an hour and it is very expensive. We have already taken on that cost years ago because, you know, our goal is to keep everybody safe. We're in the business of hospitality. We don't want anything to happen. We have security. We basically have everything in this plan. The reason why I would object to it, as it is written now, is most restaurants are not as fortunate to be as busy as we are to absorb the costs. A 10:00 p.m. closing is really an 08:00 p.m. closing, because if you're going to go out for an evening on a Friday and the restaurant closes at ten, you're probably going to go there the latest at 08:00 p.m. and that could equate to 25% reduction in sales or money for most small businesses. I would be 100% open to working with anyone that wants to talk or just some best practices we've had or stuff we, you know, learned over time to help with the bill. But I would really, really, really hope that we could do Montgomery out Montgomery county hours, just because a lot of smaller restaurants just can't absorb the cost of this. The other thing is getting security. So we only hire PG county police officers off duty. We used to always have four Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. We are lucky if we can get two right now. And a lot of times it's just one. And we try. We pay $50 an hour. We even pay more if we can't find anybody. And so that's a little bit concerning. If everybody is mandated to have security, you know, how are we all going to fill these positions? And you can hire private security companies, but they're not very good, so they don't really do much. We have private security for our parking lot and the police officers are much better. But, yeah, so public safety, the other thing I want to bring up is, you know, foundation of county government. And I think if we put resources more towards the police department, because I know right now when we have had a call, it they might show up like an hour later. And if we were in a situation where we needed someone right away, that'd be a really scary situation to be in. So that's it. But I'm always open for discussions. I would love if you guys ever want to speak, I'm here. I'm right over there. So thank you. That's all. Thank you so much. And are there any other questions or comments? Yes, councilmember Orietha? Yes. I wanted to once say that I agree with my colleague, Miss Fisher, about wanting to have some more conversation with my colleagues about possible amendments. I will note that one of the amendments that I am for sure entertaining, so my colleagues know, is the change to the time to match Montgomery county, which would be from two to 05:00 a.m. and then for an escalated if there have been calls for service at your facility for the 12:00 a.m. to 02:00 p.m. and then the other language is around, revamping the language around the cameras to not necessarily make it as prescriptive as high definition, but more so focusing on what type of imagery it should capture. That was another amendment asked from one of our industry establishments. And then I will be looking more at the exterior bathroom as well. And so if there's any other amendments or conversations, just asking for my colleagues to send it to myself and council member Fisher to review. Okay, thank you. I had one quick question before. I believe you're planning to hold it. Today was about the fiscal note. How much do you expect this bill to cost the county? As you know, we are facing another budget deficit larger than the one that we just closed. So this will be dependent upon staffing and resources. So that's something for the administration. If they feel like this is something that would cause new positions, or if they feel like this is something that could be assigned to staff, would be, I think, the biggest indicator of cost for the county, because it's something that the businesses will have to eat majority of the cost. The cost for the county is reviewing the plan. And so it's something that adds security and safety without being the county that has to necessarily eat those costs. And then the second part would be at the discretion of the council and the county executive for funding on an initiative to having a fund for businesses to alleviate costs. And that amount would again be at the discretion of the administration and the council. Just to reiterate, we ain't got no money. Okay, so I hear us on the issue of money. I do think something like this is a lower cost because we hear the idea of giving police more and more and more money, hiring more and more officers. We have to ask ourselves, what is the most cost effective thing? Because again, if we're saying we don't have money, we can't afford to say we can hire 100 more officers, pay fringe benefits, etcetera. But what we could do is have someone review safety plans and have better security measures at these establishments. And it's a partnership where if the police do think it needs on site security, then that cost is by the business instead of by the county. So I think this actually gets us safer establishments.

Some of our establishments are already doing it, and I'm sure their plans would probably be approved easily. And there's some businesses, sadly, that are in our community that have substandard safety, and I think this would hold them accountable to doing better. Vice chair Harrison, thank you. I want to thank the public for coming out and testifying on this bill. I just want to make a point to, first, I want to thank you for authoring this legislation, councilmember. I just, you know, I have some serious concerns when we talk about funds and how we earmark money. You know, I know that's all part of the budget process, but for every dollar that we spend, we have to figure out how to raise three. Okay. And so I really would like to start seeing some legislation from this, this his body on how we create new funds rather than us keep on spending. I know Councilmember Olson talked about a way through depot to raise new funds. Okay. But, you know, when we, when we start creating all these, we're going to create this fund and then we pass this legislation, then we got to scramble to go find the money to put the fund in and then we can't put the money in because we're in budget constraints in a cost containment measure, then that puts us in a predicament where we cannot fulfill. And so I would just strongly encourage my colleague, my friend, let's start putting in legislation that's going to raise some money. And I just wanted to respond to that. Agree wholeheartedly. One of the reasons why I advocated for us to get our fines raised from $1,000 to 5000, which happened, why I advocated for us to be able to be able to tax abandoned properties at a higher rate, why I have legislation that's pending around reassessing our entire fee structure and why I've been working on legislation to create pipelines specifically on development fees for health and human services. And so I agree wholeheartedly that we have, have to figure out the resources part and why. Also have asked for us to pause some of our fee waivers specifically for public safety and school surcharges, because when we give away those money to developers to not pay those fees, they do have consequences. So I 100% agree with that. I'm just trying to fix that $100 million hole that we've had because of high inflation rates. Councilmemberia, that was not necessarily, you know, an attack. That was more or less. We got to start thinking outside the box. This is not I, this is we. Okay, we there any other questions? Councilmember Olson? Yeah, thank you for Miss Skinner. I know that, you know, we had talked with the police department when they came in some months ago about the 2013 bill that I authored that was referenced today, and the police department was going to come back with some recommendations further around that. And I may have missed an email, but I want to know where that is because it may overlap with some of the things that are going on in this bill, and I don't want to work across purposes. I hope we can get that soon, if we haven't already. You did not miss an email. Okay. I did not. Okay. So we're trying to put a memorandum together for you to address the number of issues, hence why it hasn't been enforced, because it wasn't drafted well, and it's been hard for some of the agencies to carry out the, you know, required intent. So PGPD did offer some amendments, but there's more work that needs to be done and we want to make sure we're covering all bases there. But that's also another reason why we're asking for CB 16 to be held. So we can have two discussions or one discussion regarding two pieces of legislation. Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, obviously I was concerned when I found out that some of those pieces of that was not, were not being enforced because there was a lot of discussion around that at that time. And, you know, we need to make, you know, our establishment safer. Absolutely. And you may recall, Mister Olsen, it wasn't that it was not being enforced just because of just enforcing, it was because it was almost impossible the way the bill was drafted. There was so much confusion. And that's why, I mean, it's ten years, and I still don't know what aspects of those were confusing. It did seem like it was pretty straightforward in a lot of respects, but I'd love to understand what those pieces are. We can continue a number of months now. And I'm not, you know, I know we love you, Siginda, but. But we have to. We have to get this. We have to figure this out. We agree. So I just, you know, every month that goes by that this is not so. So I don't know if, you know, when we're expecting to get those comments. I would anticipate at least within the next two weeks because of CB 16, we want to make sure we're speaking to the appropriate agency so we don't find ourselves in a similar situation like we did in R with 2013.

Thank you. Councilmember Fisher. Yes, madam chair. I just wanted to say that as councilmember Oriata and I get together, I literally wrote my notes, pull cb 13 from 2013, and we'll bring all the stakeholders together to come up with something that works. So with that, I would like to propose a motion to hold cb 16. Do we need to vote on that? Okay, we have a motion by council member Fisher, second by Vice chair Harrison. Please, please call the roll chair Ivey. Motion to hold. I vote aye. Miss Blagay? Aye. Mister Burroughs. Aye. Mister Danoga. Aye. Ms. Fisher? Aye. Mister Olson, vote aye. Vice chair Harrison. Miss Orietha, Miss Watson. Aye. Motion carries 90. Next, we will have one presentation for two resolutions that are associated with each other. CR 33 2024, a resolution concerning fiscal year 2024 annual action Plan for housing and community development for the purpose of amending the Prince George's county fiscal year 2024 Annual Action Plan for housing and Community development by adding the Bowie Commons Project, an eligible activity not originally funded or described in the fiscal year 2024 annual Action Plan and the reprogramming and reallocating reallocation of $1 million in home investment partnerships program funds from the fiscal year 2021 annual action Plan to support the Bowie Commons project. This is sponsored by council members Ivy Watson, Harrison, Fisher, Hawkins and Franklin, and also CR 34 2024, a resolution concerning payments in lieu of taxes agreement for the Bowie Commons apartments for the purpose of approving the terms and conditions of a payments in lieu of taxes agreement between Prince George's County, Maryland and Bowie Housing Partners LP, sponsored by council members Watson, Ivy, Harrison, Hawkins, Franklin and Fisher. We will now have a presentation, and I believe Raina Hightower is leading that. Good afternoon, Madam chair and members of the county council. CR 33 2024 was introduced on Tuesday, April 23, 2024. There was a public hearing on this resolution held today. The resolution amends the FY 2024 annual Action plan to allocate $1 million to the Bowie Commons project. The project will renovate a 36 unit apartment community, which includes six walk up buildings for seniors earning 60% or below the area median income. The project consists of one bedroom units. There are two units set aside for mobility impaired seniors and one unit for seniors who have sensory impairments. The Budget and Policy Analysis Division submitted a policy statement stating that this resolution, when adopted, aligns with the plan 2035 goals. Also miss I'm the director of the department of Housing and Community Development. Director espholia. It's a KS sound, not an x sound. I checked with her. I tried to too, madam chair, but I keep getting it messed up. And Mister Andrew Johnson, assistant development manager with Vedas, will provide a PowerPoint presentation on this project. The presentation can be found on pages 4480 through 485 of your virtual binder. With your permission, chair Ivey, I would like to turn to Director Xfolia. Thank you, Director Kisfolia. Great. Thank you all very much for trying that hard. It's heartwarming. No, it was great. Thank you. I want to clarify just a couple of things about the project, and then I will turn it to the developer, Mister Andrew Johnson, to give you much more detail. This is housing for extremely low income seniors in the county. So besides our assistance, the developer has secured permanent rental assistance that supports actually, right now, households who are below 30% of area median income, and actually the actual income of their residents averages at 23% of area median income. So with our assistance, through the money and the pilot, they're able to leverage additional private investment to do two things. One, fix up critical repairs in the property and also extend the affordability covenants and properties like that. We do have a limited supply of properties like that in the county, and that is evident on the very, very low vacancies with sea within this kind of properties. So with that, I'll pass it to the developer to give you a much more detailed presentation. Thank you. My name is Andrew Johnson. I'm with Vitus, the developer for this project. I appreciate your time. I'm going to talk about the proposed rehabilitation of 36 elderly designated housing units in Bowie, Maryland. So I'll start by talking about the development team here first. Developer is obviously Vitus.

I appreciate your time. I'm going to talk about the proposed rehabilitation of 36 elderly designated housing units in Bowie, Maryland. So I'll start by talking about the development team here first. Developer is obviously Vitus. We specialize in acquiring existing section eight housing, extending that affordability, and then layering tax credits to facilitate the rehab of those properties. We've done that with over 15,000 units, and we have active projects in 30 different states. So we're very familiar with this process, and that's what we're looking to do here with Bowie Commons as far as Maryland is concerned. We recently rehabilitated Charles Landing, a six unit property in indian head, Maryland. We also have three proposed rehabilitations in addition to Bowie Commons. So we're very excited to continue working in the state and always looking for opportunities to support preservation of affordable housing and in this case, elderly residents. The GC here is southwest builders, based out of Baltimore and Maryland. Dedicated multifamily team, 10,000 units across the mid atlantic region. So very strong regional presence here. The architect is truecraft architecture. They're extensively credentialed, and we've completed over 24 projects with them, 19 under contract. So we have our system down quite well with them as well. And then manager is arco management, a massive property management group that oversees 40,000 units, and they manage 40 of our properties, so we have a great rapport. And now to orient you a little bit more towards the property itself, you'll notice the unit mix at the top of the slide. Here they are, one bedroom apartments, townhome style, all elderly, designated 100%, covered by a section eight contract. The median income levels, you'll notice that there's a 50% set aside for two units, and that's contingent on the approval of home funds. This property is extremely conveniently located right next to the Bowie senior Center and also the Bowie gymnasium. So really great locational amenities. And having the opportunity to rehabilitate this property provides a lot of assistance to them as well. And as general background, Vitas purchased a leasehold interest in the property in 2022 using bridge financing, and that ground lease is with the city of Bowie and expires in 2039. So I'll move on to the proposed rehabilitation. I have listed here the sources and uses for this project, obviously highlighted in orange. There's the home funds consideration, and in addition to that, there is a general partner note of $2 million. So Vitus is very invested in this project and looking for, looking forward to the opportunity to provide additional quality to these residents. And additionally, there's $3 million of lihtc equity that we're pursuing, expecting to close that in the late third quarter of this year or early fourth quarter, and then immediately after that is when we will initiate construction. And that will take an approximate nine months. And then six of those months will be in unit work. And then each individual unit will take about 20 days, with the exception of the ADA compliant units, which will take 30 days. And does anybody have any questions on this so far? I have a question. Financially, would it be possible for you to do this project without the money that we're discussing today? It would be. It would be possible, but it would definitely be adding additional strain to this project. As noted with the general partner note, we're invested and we will do everything it takes to make this project work and help these residents. But ultimately, the addition of the home funds really enables us to better provide the amenities that these residents deserve. Things like energy efficient appliances, all new bathroom, kitchen, and h vac system windows. So really great improvements that we're excited about, but the home funds really makes a difference here. Thank you. Any other questions? Okay, and if we are finished with that, we will take two different motions. Yes, sorry, one quick. There's one last slide here. Just wanted to quickly speak to Vitus. Commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. First, I would like to recognize Vitas acknowledges the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, both in the affordable housing crisis as well as the business environment. So Vitas appreciates the council's commitment to trying to address these issues. And so we are more than happy to comply with the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have been set forth by the county. And we're going to use our best efforts to both meet that and then exceed those goals, both with the county as well as the state. And then that is. That's all I have. So once again, my name is Andrew Johnson for any questions. Thank you. Miss Hightower, did you have anything to add? No, ma'am. Thank you. Okay. And let me check with the office of Law and the county execs offices. We ask for a favorable. We're in committee of all recommendation. Thank you. And madam chair, we had the opportunity to review this legislation and it's legally sufficient. Okay. Is there a motion on Cr 33? I'd like to make a motion and move favorable.

We have a motion by Vice chair Harrison. Second by council member Watson. Madam Clerk, please call the roll chair Ivey. I vote aye. And in explaining my vote, I just wanted to thank the developer who is putting so much effort and investment into providing housing for low income seniors.

Aye. Miss Watson? I vote aye. And I just want to also thank you for the work you've done on this project. I know the residents of Bowie Commons certainly appreciate this.

This is sponsored by council members Harrison, Ivy, Watson, Der Noga, Franklin and Hawkins. Is there a. Well, first of all, Miss Director Cospolia, do you have anything that you'd like to add? Only one clarification. As you know, during COVID we received three pockets of cv money. Two were directly from the federal government, CV one and cv three. We did the process back then. We came in front of you for approval and the funds were deployed, but a lot of those activities finished with a balance. So right now we're taking that balance, which was about 1.3 million. We did another RFP process, and it was only for public service because that is what the eligibility of those funds are. So exhibit a includes our recommendations, and it's pretty straightforward. Everybody who was eligible has been funded, and you will see a handful of applications that were not funded. It's because they were not eligible for this specific of Civi money. So that's all I have to clarify, but I'm happy to answer questions. I'll go briefly to the office of Law and to the county executive's office, Miss Bell. Thank you. Madam chair. We've had the opportunity to review CR 35 and found it legally sufficient. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, madam chair. We're asking for a favorable recommendation. Thank you.

Good afternoon, chair. Not yet. Okay. Well, then we will start with Sakenda Skinner. Thank you, madam chair. And good afternoon, madam chair and council members. So we are joined today with Director Ospacea Xbolia, chief housing development manager Pam Wilson, who is in attendance in the KCG development team, Karla Burke, Bin Bullock and Kareem Abdul Salaam. And they're here to do a presentation on the casity project involving the home Arp HITF and the pilot agreement. And they're going to be here to answer any questions for the council members. And I'm going to turn it over to director auspices at this time. Great. And I will be very brief just to explain a couple of little things that are a little unique about this project. You've seen us come in front of you for similar projects, but it is the first time that we are using home ARP in a project. So we will be delivering, as part of this affordable housing development, a handful of units that will be permanent housing for people who coming out of homelessness. So we worked very closely with the continuum of care, and we're very excited to launch this because we have very limited resources to do something that deep. But with the home ARP resources that it was a one time infusion of money that went down to the local jurisdictions from HUD, we now have the ability to do that. So I do want to thank the development team for working very closely with us to make something that is really hard possible. And so in a little bit of clarity, before I pass the button to them, those units will be restricted at 30% of area median income. But as you saw on your packages, we are really, because they don't have operating support coming along with that. We don't know what will actually be the income of those residents. It may be all the way down to 5%. And so we assume that it will be very little and we are taking that into account as we are looking at the project financials. Also. This project will deliver a handful of what we call yes units. We have done a few other projects with yes units with you before, but just as a reminder, those are priority units for youth coming out of the foster care system, and those are restricted at 40% of area median income. So with that, I think the developer has put together a detailed presentation and we're here to answer questions. Thank you. Did I push it? Am I on? Thank you. Thank you for having us. My name is Carla Burke. I am an executive vice president with KCG Development. We are a national affordable housing development developer and the primary business that we do is affordable housing throughout the country, primarily in eight states. We have partnered on this project with Streetscape, who is a local developer. And this is actually our second project with Streetscape and our second in Prince George's county. So our other project is, is under construction, and some of you may have passed it. It's up in Bowie, off of 193, right at route 50 in the traditions of Beachfield neighborhood. We are doing a senior affordable housing component in that neighborhood. So this will be our second in the county. I wanted to also run through. I gotta multitask. Not only speak, but do slides. Wanted to also make you aware that we are aware of CBO 51 and this development will be in compliance with that. We will be using a third party general contractor named commercial Construction, which is MBE certified. And we have also listed for you the jobs we anticipate that this development will bring to the community. Just a couple highlights for you. This is 175 units and three buildings.

We have partnered on this project with Streetscape, who is a local developer. And this is actually our second project with Streetscape and our second in Prince George's county. So our other project is, is under construction, and some of you may have passed it. It's up in Bowie, off of 193, right at route 50 in the traditions of Beachfield neighborhood. We are doing a senior affordable housing component in that neighborhood. So this will be our second in the county. I wanted to also run through. I gotta multitask. Not only speak, but do slides. Wanted to also make you aware that we are aware of CBO 51 and this development will be in compliance with that. We will be using a third party general contractor named commercial Construction, which is MBE certified. And we have also listed for you the jobs we anticipate that this development will bring to the community. Just a couple highlights for you. This is 175 units and three buildings. I wanted to bring your attention that these buildings are all going to be elevator served. And so that is unusual sometimes. And so all three buildings will be elevator served. There will be secured entrance into the buildings themselves. We do plan on some large recreational space, walking paths, community rooms with fitness center. The units themselves will have washer and dryer hookups, but there will also be a common area laundry. This development, as previously mentioned, is 100% affordable. And we have broken out those unit counts for you. So you can see the 50% AMI units and what those rents would be if someone qualified at that 5% level. Obviously, as previously mentioned, that can go up to 30% AMI. And the 40% AMI units are those yes units that were previously discussed. A brief map just of the location where we're at off of Kerem Boulevard, proximity to schools, proximity to bus stops and metro, as well as fire, police and amenities in the area. And so we feel that we are well located to serve the residents. Here is a rendering that we had done as to what we anticipate the project looking like. Craftman stuff style, four stories. You can also see the layout of the three buildings based on the site and how the site is laid out. And wanted to kind of talk through a little bit about our sources and uses just to let the council know this development is kind of three years in the works. And so we very much appreciate as changes, right, that we've been able to really work with DHCD and the county to fulfill some of the funding gaps that arose over those three years. And we were able to work with them to get those 5% AMI units in, some of those yes units in to provide high quality housing in the county. So with that, I will. I'm happy to take questions. Councilmember Bligue no, I just wanted to express support and thank you all for reaching out to my office and bringing this type of development to my district. We definitely need this as we're trying to stabilize rent due to the fact that we don't have affordable housing. More of these projects provide the opportunity for us to, to house those that have been really unhoused. So thank you so much for this, and thank you for reaching out to my office. I do recognize that you previously worked with my predecessor on this, but I look forward to partnership going forward. Thank you. We look forward to working with you as your health. Mister Hawkins. Madam Chair, I just want to echo what the district member from six Express. The three years you all have been involved with our county and with our county representatives to get to this point. Thank you for your steadfastness. Council Woman Fisher well, thank you all for this and thank you for your hard work. Thank you, Madam Director, for your constant leadership as well. I just have a, I was looking for a comment for you all to the council. As we have tough decisions and things, what would you say could either help our county or would incentivize developers like you to come to us to actually do the sort of work that you're doing and what would you have gone through the experience and some feedback would be, I think, appreciated. No, I appreciate that. And we don't get asked that a lot. So I do appreciate that. We love coming to communities that want affordable housing. And so I very much appreciate that this council understands the need and understands what we're providing, but it is difficult. It is very expensive with impact and impact fees that don't always align with, you know, the rents that we're going to be providing. And I know, you know, we have worked with folks to see about getting some relief there. It is great that you guys have soft funds available to help with that gap funding. So the more that that's available and the more that you guys have flexibility in your programs, that is a huge help for us. Sometimes when programs are very rigid, it's hard to maneuver the need of the development to really meet the financial need because we don't get to maneuver around rents. Those are kind of set for us. And that's part of the reason why you guys like affordable housing, because those rents are capped at those AMI levels. So, Kareem, am I missing something? First of all, let me thank the council chair and a lot of the members that I know personally, but I wanted to say to council member Bellegate, because she really took the time to understand the project, even though it was approved by her predecessor, and she went out of her way to really make sure that we took it to the next level. She wanted to make sure what was there would be there. And so that's just always, as, you know, as council members, you know, we as developers come, we said this is what we're going to provide. But at the end of the day, sometimes there's a needed bait and switch. But we made sure that that did not happen in this project and we made sure that we let the council member know first hand what we were doing every step of the way.

But she definitely rose to the occasion to answer. The point that Miss Fisher questioned is that as a local developer here in the county, we've developed major projects inside the Capitol Beltway, from Walker Mill Road to the villages of Pepper mills to Laurel and the council member Donega's district back in the day. And one of the things that has really been the angst of developers is not really being able to sit down with DHCD in the past to work out a proper process. And I think what DHCD now, they have been very amenable to really work through what could be the auditor. Possible. And so we can't thank y'all enough for doing that. So I think that's. Y'all know, some of y'all know I can be, like, quite loquacious. So I'm gonna shut up on that one. Because it's the partnership, sometimes it's best to stop it. Yes. Right.

Madam Clerk, we have the additions to the agenda, but it is CB 29, which is council member Burroughs bill, and he's not present. There he is. Great. An act concerning juvenile and minor curfew zones for the purpose of allowing commercial property owners the ability to request the police chief chief to create zones within the county with a more restrictive juvenile or minor curfew, providing for the application for a more restrictive juvenile or minor curfew zone, including the specification of the zone covered following reasonable geographical boundaries, providing that the proposed area is primarily commercial, providing that the applicant demonstrates the ability to provide notice to the public of the more restrictive juvenile or minor for future zone, and providing the applicant includes a letter of support from at least one county council member that represents the district containing the more restrictive juvenile or minor curfew zone and other related provisions. We will have a staff overview and madam chair, Mister Bakkers is on her way. I will be passing out a copy of the draft to council members in the meantime. Just a moment. Okay, thank you. Is this my gun? Good afternoon. I apologize for being indisposed momentarily with that. Yeah. Oh, I wasn't sure. Okay. Good afternoon, committee members. Karen Zabako is here. In your for today's cow agenda, you'll see a proposed draft two which okay. Of CB 29. Really, there is no substantive change in the content of the bill. What this proposed draft two attempts to do is restyle the bill from a regular bill to an emergency bill, which is set forth. Its procedural steps are set forth in your charter in section 317, and those changes affect the title which you'll note in the beginning of the material before line one.

What this proposed draft two attempts to do is restyle the bill from a regular bill to an emergency bill, which is set forth. Its procedural steps are set forth in your charter in section 317, and those changes affect the title which you'll note in the beginning of the material before line one. And it's styled as an emergency bill. I also decided to expand your purpose clause to actually state early and often the nature of the emergency, which I'd like to share for anyone that's in the viewing public. It begins on line ten. It says, in declaring that a public emergency exists affecting the public health, safety and welfare, said emergency being the need to protect minors and residents from the negative effects of criminal activity by limiting the places open to the public where minors may remain between certain hours. Okay, so, as I said, the substance of the bill is identical to your draft one. And then finally, your charter requires that emergency legislation contain certain additional things, namely the statement of the emergency and what it is. So the language beginning in line eleven on page eight, which is now proposed, section four, uncodified of the bill, restates the nature of the public emergency, which I went over in your long title. And finally, on page nine, you'll see that there are two other changes that come along with becoming emergency legislation, and that is that its effective date will be on the date it becomes law. As you know, the emergency legislation does not have a 45 day lag after signature by the executive or otherwise becoming law. So that does away with that. And it also requires an affirmative vote of two thirds of the full council. So that would be eight votes. So that's a sum total of really non substantive. But charter required changes that would be needed to make the bill go into law and become effective faster than just a regular bill. Thank you. Thank you so much. Are there any comments from Mister Burroughs? Thank you madam chair, and thank you members of the county council. It is with no joy that I bring this bill forward, but I can assure you that there is an absolute need to make this emergency legislation. I am concerned about the public health, safety and welfare at certain commercial zones in our county, particularly in my district. I'm also concerned about not just protecting our county assets, particularly those that are the economic engines of the county, but also protecting the young people. When we have hundreds of young people gathered and all out brawls at 01:00 a.m. 02:00 a.m. i'm concerned for their safety and well being. So not only am I concerned about protecting the economic engine, I'm concerned about protecting the residents of my district, one of which is here. But I'm also concerned about young people engaged in all out destructive behavior. Destruction of property, breaking into cars, looting restaurants and other stores, and hurting one another. This bill also holds parents accountable. There are instances where parents refuse to pick up their children once they there, once they've been called. And it's important that we communicate to our parents that it's important to know exactly where your children are and what they're doing. I know. I have reports of parents who are renting out hotel rooms, thinking that maybe five or six young people will be in the room, but it ends up being 50 young people engaged in very destructive behavior to themselves and to the community. And so this is one step, this is not the end all, be all. But it's an important step. And I would respectfully ask for your support. I'd like to turn to the office of law. Good afternoon. The office of the law had a chance to review the proposed language in the legislation, including the changes to making it an emergency bill, and find it to be in proper legislative form. Thank you. And the county executive's office. Yes, ma'am. Good afternoon again, madam chair and council members. The county executive does support CB 2929-2024 proposed draft two. And we want to thank Mister Burroughs for putting this legislation forward. Thank you. Are there any questions or comments from the council. Miss Oreada, thank you. Thank you, Councilman Burroughs, for your work on this legislation. I do understand the issues that have come up, specifically in your district. I do have a couple of things just hopefully that we can consider as we work through the bill. One of my concerns was just around the length of it and for the drafter, if I'm missing it, please do point me in that direction. It seems to be kind of like if you get this approved, you have it indefinitely. I think it should be like a renewal process, maybe annually for this curfew. Another area that I hope that we could discuss is around the letter of approval from representation. Being that we have in district and at large members, I think that's an opportunity for us to say maybe two representatives that would encompass the voice of that large and the in district member. And the last point I'll make is just trying to understand, when we talk about reasonable geographical boundaries, that's not really a set definition.

So I'm just not sure what this would look like for inside of my district. I do understand the impetus is for certain businesses, but it doesn't. It's very broad, and so I'm just curious if there's any guidance on what that reasonable would be, or is it just based on what the police believe to be reasonable? So those are my thoughts and questions. Thank you. We have council member vice chair Harrison and then council member Franklin. Thank you, madam chair. I want to thank the bill sponsor, councilmember Burroughs, for really, you know, being the author of this legislation at such a crucial time in our county. Thank you for your leadership in this matter. Councilmember Burroughs, as you know, we all know people that live at National harbor, we know the business owners at National harbor, and just getting a lot of calls about what transpired was truly unsettling. Anytime you hear things of vandalism, theft, people getting jumped, fights, underage drinking, vomiting on sidewalks, things of that nature, that is not who we are as a county, and we have to protect the welfare of the citizens, our county. And your leadership on this matter is ensuring that we're doing everything that we can. So I just want to take a moment to just say thank you for your leadership in this matter. And, you know, people that are committing these types of carelessness behavior should be held responsible to the highest extent of the law, whatever that might be. We cannot have this in our community, and it has no place in our community. Thank you, council member Franklin. And then council member Fisher. Thank you, madam Chair. I definitely support the legislation. I wanted to ask the administration a question. Is the administration committed to enforcing this curfew if it's approved by a particular commercial area? Mister Franklin, I'd hope so. You know, the county executive does support this legislation in recognizing that the chief of police or the police department have a responsibility. There is real teeth in this legislation. So to answer your question, yes, executive agency, that is the Prince George's county police department, will do what it needs to do to enforce this legislation. Thank you. Because I asked that question, because, as you know, there's already an ongoing curfew countywide that isn't enforced regularly. And so I am hopeful that if this particular curfew law goes into effect, that it will be enforced. But I am concerned that the county's current curfew law doesn't appear to be enforced. That's my observation. Thank you, Councilmember Fisher. Thank you, madam chair. And I want to thank the bill sponsor, councilmember Burrows, for your hard work. And it's definitely, I don't think any of us feel always 100% comfortable in the things that are necessary for our community, so I really thank you. And as chair of health and human services and public safety, just seeing what's been going on and over the weekend, I'm extremely concerned and very supportive of this legislation. I do have a question, though, for the administration, and it's kind of piggybacking on the astute comments of councilmember Franklin. And one part of the bill that I do, that I do support is just a more emphasis on parental responsibility. And on page six, I guess, when a parent is not found to actually pick up the juvenile in question, it says they shall be released to the department of Social services or upon the recommendation. I wanted to understand how the mechanics of that and will the department be available? As councilmember Burroughs was saying in his statement, it can be a very late hour, you know, 03:00 a.m. hour and things like that. And, you know, as much as I want to make sure our community and our young people are also safe, you know, I also don't want to see young people sitting there for hours because their parent is not available or something like that. And they're also waiting on 08:00 a.m. for Department of Juvenile services to come in. So I either wanted to know the comments on that, or at least that there'll be a commitment to make sure that someone's available, because I do believe a lot of these incidences are going to be happening at a late night hour where most county employees are not available. Thank you, Councilmember Fisher, for that question. I can tell you that my understanding is that the police department is going to be working in partnership with the department of social services. And, you know, this bill is not only intended to prevent crime, but also have the parent responsibility piece that the bill sponsor mentioned earlier. So I do believe if the parent does not, you know, show responsibility and do their part in showing up to, you know, receive their minor child or the person that they're responsible for, police will do what they need to do and contact you.

We are returning as committee of the whole. We are going to change our agenda a bit and start our budget work session with the board of education, and we will start with our committee director, Mister Albert. Thank you and good afternoon council members. For the record, my name is Ariana Albear, director of the Education and Workforce Development Committee, and I will present a brief report on the board of Education's fiscal year 2025 capital Improvement budget. If I could have the presentation up on the she said if you could continue the fiscal year 2025 CIP budget includes $191 million in funding and $173 million in expenditures. This represents an increase of 30 million and 11 million respectively from fiscal year 2024. By source state the state is providing around 35% of the total, with the county providing the rest. The chart on this table, I think it's up, shows the historical geo bond funding. The chart on this next page shows the historical state aid to the county CIP. This next section shows unspent state and county allocations. Pgcps currently has unspent allocations going as far back as fiscal year 2016 and a total of $175 million. While the majority is from the past two fiscal years, $111 million remain unencumbered. The second chart shows unspent state allocations per project name. The last chart on this page shows the amount of funds allocated by the county that remain unspent. Unspent allocations go as far back as fiscal year 2014, and 176 million of the 324 million remain unencumbered by project type. The chart on this page shows the amount that remains unspent. This page notes some of the primary factors for the construction delays per pgcps. These includes lack of adequate funding, permitting delays from a number of different agencies, poor soil quality, and supply chain disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic. This section shows the video lottery terminal projects that are currently awaiting completion. Because these projects are legislated, additional legislation would be required to reallocate or cancel the project funding from past projects. This next section discusses the process for choosing which schools are next for modernization or replacement, which I won't go over for time, and these next few sections cover individual school construction projects. I will just discuss the ones with substantial changes. A number of these projects like the Bowie High School, Annex C Alistair Bedrig Fairmont Heights High School, New Glen Ridge area Middle School Stephen Decatur Tulip Grove elementary School, are still awaiting fiscal closeout. Cool Springs Judith Heuer Modernization project increased by 63.5 million and was rescoped to include a therapy pool a family center and PGCPS offices. Moving on to the High Point Sci renovation, this project was delayed due to the Suitland Annex project. The new Northern Adelphi Area High School project total increased by $89 million and completion is now expected in fiscal year 2029. And then going on to the Suitland annex, replacement completion is delayed until fiscal year 2029. The total project cost added $73 million in fiscal year 2024 and 99 million is expected for fiscal year 2025 for a total project cost of $390 million. And finally, in this section, the William Schmidt Educational center cost increased by $17 million due to additional scope. This section here provides the legislative and fiscal background to the Build to Learn act, which enable the county's public private partnership. A list of the schools in phase one and phase two are provided in the list. This next section provides information on ongoing PGCPS projects. The images from the superintendent's fiscal year 2025 budget provide information on projects scheduled for the fiscal year contingent on funding availability and projects completed in fiscal year 2024. A number of these ongoing projects have no proposed expenditures in fiscal year 2025, primarily due to debt affordability concerns from the big construction projects like Suitland. PGCPs noted that some construction in these projects will be completed using past unspent appropriations. These include ADA upgrades, buried fuel tank replacements, code corrections, lead remediation, central garage, h vac upgrades, kitchen and food service upgrades. Although pgcps mentioned construction will continue through the foodservice subsidy from the operating budget, land building and infrastructure, major repairs, open space pods, parking lots and driveways planning and design, roof replacements, secondary school reform, security upgrades and stadium upgrades as part of the state's aging Schools program, PGCPS is proposed to receive and spend $1 million. Notably, the county accounts for 40% of unspent allocations from fiscal year 2016 through fiscal year 2023.

The last item on this report is the Maryland maintenance of Maryland's public schools report by the Interagency Commission on School Construction, or IAC. During this last report from fiscal year 2023, published in the fall, PGCP scored 63.7% or not adequate in the school system's maintenance score. This represents a drop of 2.79% and places the county penultimate after Somerset county in the state, the county had 130 of the 336 minor deficiencies. The chart on this page shows the county's score relative to other counties. And the IAC report recommendations has consistently noted a need for better computerized management system to address these issues and any issues that come up. And finally, the last chart on this page shows that there is no correlation between the age of a school and their overall maintenance rating. This concludes my presentation. I'm happy to answer any questions about the report. Otherwise, PGCPS Superintendent House and his staff are present and available to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you. Thank you so much. And Mister House, the floor is yours. Thank you. Madam chair and council members, glad to be here. As we know, very difficult year, not only in the state of Maryland, but in our county as well. And we are prepared with a budget to answer any questions that you all may have. I do have my chief financial officer, Lisa Howell, as well as members from my capital improvement team here to answer any clarifying questions at this time. Okay, so, do you have a question, Miss Warrior? Okay. Miss Fisher. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Madam chair. Hi, it's good to see you, Mister House. How are you? I wanted to ask you a little bit if you could maybe expand, and I don't know if this is the right form for this budget question, but I'll just put it out there on busing of our children. I'm sorry, councilmember Fisher, if you can move the mic a little closer, some people are struggling a little bit to hear you. Thank you, ma'am. Is that better? Okay. I wanted to ask you something that I think all of us here at the council care deeply about and discuss in various different bills is obviously the welfare of our children, which we spend the most money on. So we want to see good results. Right. I think the busing of our children has been a huge issue, I know, in the recruitment of bus drivers. And then something that we all discuss and sort of try to think about is how do we move children from school to then different activities, right. To fill their days and to help supplement them after the school day ends. And so I wanted to talk to you. I wanted you to expand a little bit about what does busing for the 2025 budget for PG CPS look like? What are you doing on the recruitment and retention of your drivers? What is our school system able to do to expand the movement of children to the opportunities for their potential across our county? That would be greatly deserved. Absolutely. And of course, upon my arrival, one of the things that I took a close look at is was just kind of the history of transportation in the county with pgcps, and soon learned that there had been quite a bit of heartburn over the course of time in terms of how we transport our children and really the dependability of buses and several other things that go along with our transportation of our students as well. Decided to move forward with a comprehensive audit through a nationally renowned organization called formative. And so my transportation and operations team has been working very closely with formative to move forward with a significant number of recommendations. One of the biggest recommendations that probably many of you have heard about is the change of bell times. And to make this as simple as possible, in pgcps we had over 1314 different bell times. That's actually start times of our schools. We have moved forward. We actually made an announcement on the 25th that we're moving to three different tiers and that should offer us a significant level of service improvement in reference to what we're looking for. There are a number of other improvements and we'd be glad recommendations that we'll be moving forward with and I'd be glad to send those to the council, if you don't mind, Doctor Coleman, if you want to share a little bit more at the microphone around what we're doing here. But we're very excited about what this will mean for pgcps and families and students moving forward. Sure. Thank you so much for that question. And again, as Superintendent House said, he has prioritized improving the transportation system across our district and we have taken that charge very seriously.

And again, as Superintendent House said, he has prioritized improving the transportation system across our district and we have taken that charge very seriously. With the rollout of a multi year, multi phase plan, we are preparing to implement phase one. The first lead, foundational step in that plan is to adjust bell times, as was discussed. And then it will follow with the inclusion of four additional steps. Consolidating bus stops to make our bus trips more efficient. Auditing our walk zone, meaning the non transportation zone nearest our schools, actually services 26,000 or a third of our ridership. And so there's a need to assess whether or not students in that non transportation zone still require a bus. We're going to be moving forward with an opt out option for our families that have a bus, meaning they meet the criteria for a bus for their children, but they no longer need it. They either take their child to school or have some other way in which they get them to school. So we just want them to let us know that they no longer need that bus and therefore we can make our trips more efficient. And we're also focusing in on customer service, because we've heard from our families that they want to have a real clear line of communication around the location of the bus and be able to reach out to us in the need that arises. So with all of that being said, we have our eye on improving efficiency of our transportation system. System while also maintaining a priority on safety. Mom chair, am I allowed to follow up? Yes, you may. Okay. So within that. Am I interrupting? Within that plan. So what is your, what are you proposing in your, in your. In a budget priority in the recruitment and retention of your drivers? So I don't want to speak for human resources because I'm the chief operating officer, but I will tell you that we work closely with our HR partners with a consistent recruitment strategy and retention strategy for our drivers. We do pay to have drivers trained. If they don't come to us with a CDL, we will certainly train them to be a driver with us. And there are a number of incentives that we provide to our respective candidates. But what I will also say, councilmember Fisher, is that because of the efficiency in this first round of recommendations that we're moving forward with, there actually should be a need for less drivers. Right now, with so many different start times, our need was, of course, greater. But because we are consolidating not only stops consolidating bell times significantly, we should be in a position where we will need less drivers. Now, we'll still need drivers and we'll still need to recruit because the driver shortage is real and it's been consistent nationwide. And we have one of the largest fleets, I think the 8th largest ridership in the nation with 85,000 students. So our need will always be there. But this is about consolidation of efforts and ensuring that we do what makes sense. So we're very proud of our principals, our community that's provided us feedback in this first stage of the process. We're really looking forward to kicking this off when school starts. Thanks. And then. I'm sorry, ma'am. Trying to like a couple of follow ups. Okay. So the other thing that I wanted to maybe. And I'll go to something else. Touch on buses is. I know I sent, I forgot who in your administration I sent the email to, but I'll pull it up. And I talked to Director Johnson from DPWT about this. I know you have some buses that will be coming online for electric. Right. And I didn't want to see our department of Public works and our school system doing two different things to retrograde those goals. Do you have anything in your budget that's going to speak to our buses becoming more environmentally friendly and going in electric. And like I said, I copied both of you, but I can resend it about how are you going to, or can you work with our department of Public Works and Transportation as well as you guys all have to do some retrofitting for electric buses and vehicles. So we are excited about the opportunity of moving forward with more climate friendly transportation options as a part of our fleet. Through the ESsa grant as well as the Volkswagen grant, we've been able to procure 21 electric vehicles, buses that we are looking to bring online in short order. The question is around the infrastructure, as you talked about. And so we are open to having collaboration with our county partners to find more financially sound ways in which to charge those vehicles in a way that we can share that burden. Okay, and I'll resend that email that I sent out, and I think I referred director early. I think I sent it with Sakinda as well, but I'll resend it out for you all to kind of speak about how that can work. The other thing I wanted to talk about was the bandwidth of after school transportation of children. You know, the council sits as so many, so many things, and when we talk to, you know, our law enforcement partners at Explorers and the cadets program, and the biggest feedback we have gotten in this room is we have the activities or different things to help supplement our children, but we can't get them there.

And like I said, our children and our school system is the biggest part of our budget. We spend the most on you. So is there anything that you all can do to help facilitate or be a part of transporting children to programs and activities and good enrichment after the school hours? Because for me, I feel I always say I rather pay for a desk than a cell. And that's why we've made all the priorities at the state level and why we continue to have the taxpayer pay for our children at an exorbitant rate. And then the community goes, well, why can't the schools help out? Why can't you all help take children to these programs? So they have other things to do then, as you all know, the heightened issues around juvenile crime and other things. So is there anything in this budget that you are going to step up and helping transport children to? I don't know if Councilman Burroughs is online because I definitely don't want to take his thunder, but is there anything that, you know, you all are looking to do or to collaborate with us? Because I just feel, I think you feel the passion in my voice because I just feel like we spend a lot of money, like a whole lot of money. And it's really, really hard when we have to go to our seniors and say we don't have. We have to go to everyone else and say we don't have. And then we come to you and we hear no. So I would like to know how you're gonna step up, because we all have to step up. That's the truth in this county, every single one of us. And so I really want to know, what are you all going to do after the bell rings to help get children to places that they need? So thank you so much for that question. The first thing that we always have to stay laser focused around is our obligation to the school district and our children and getting them to and from school safely and on time. And so as Superintendent House outlined, we currently are not operationally organized in such a way that we can even meet the demand that we have adequately. So that's why the transportation audit first has to be implemented properly so that we can streamline our operations so that we can, one, meet the demands of the school district and then second, be available for others. Just as an example, as we're currently configured with our bell times, we currently have approximately 1150 bus trips that have to be run by 07:45 a.m. or earlier with an acting capacity of drivers of approximately 850. So on any given morning, if every driver comes to work, we're short about 300 trips at the time that the audit was completed, 300 drivers to complete those trips. And so that also cascades into the afternoon where when they get out of school, we have that same deficit at the first dismissal tier, the second dismissal tier and the third dismissal tier. And so that's important to note because that puts us behind every day with picking up children from school and therefore it doesn't make them available to support whatever county program we may look to do. So the first thing we have to do is become more organizationally efficient with our system. We do as a school district, work with our community partners. I was on a call just yesterday with Maryland National Capital park and planning as we are preparing to support summer programming and the many different programs that happen outside of PGCPs. So I do want to assure you and the council that that partnership is strong and we provide that support to those communities. But depending upon when these extra programs are that you are speaking to, we certainly are open to a conversation about what capacity we have to support it. We would just have to, have to get into the specifics. And just to make a note, Vice chair Harrison let me know that he's going to hold a hearing in education workforce development that will include transportation with the school system. So we'll make sure. And actually, they're coming on the 6th to discuss some other issues, so. Okay. Councilmember Orietta, thank you. And thank you for. I forget, I'm sorry. And council member Franklin is after you. Go ahead. Thank you. A few questions. One, wanting to look at the Suitland project in my district, seeing that it is the delayed, and I do understand has some inflation issues. And then there was a presentation about, like, issues around some of the delays being like, permitting other issues. Can you speak to a little bit like, what are the delays we're seeing with this project and what can we do to help this happen? Sure. Thank you. And be glad to have one of our capital improvement staff members to come up and share some insight around that. Good afternoon, council. So, regarding Sulen High School, as we presented in the past before, you know, this project kind of is bid and designed during a period of uncertainty, you know, with the pandemic inflation, you know, the cost escalation associated with different products, whether steel glazing, roofing products, etcetera.

So, regarding Sulen High School, as we presented in the past before, you know, this project kind of is bid and designed during a period of uncertainty, you know, with the pandemic inflation, you know, the cost escalation associated with different products, whether steel glazing, roofing products, etcetera. And so that kind of all attributed to some of the pricing escalation that we're seeing. And another very large component of this is it is a phase project. So we're delivering this project while we have occupied school, and that then drives out the duration of the project. So we're looking at three phases. We're roughly a little bit north of four years, roughly close to five years. And so if you take into consideration the duration that multiple relocations from phase one to phase two, moving students, etcetera, and then dragging out construction, that also contributed to the costs that we're seeing for student high school. And is the decision to do it this way of phases, was that a cost analysis? Did we not have the space to move the student? So it's based off of space. Right. So within that area, and trying to make sure that we maintain the school body within the same community. Community and not disrupt their educational learning abilities. And also factoring in CTE as well. You know, we didn't have any spaces within that area that could accommodate, you know, relocating that entire school to another school. And can you refresh my memory on the original projected timeline and where we are now, just so I can see what the delay did for this? We're probably at this point maybe about a year and a half delayed. You know, we've had some challenges going back and forth on some additional requests through our permitting requirements. And so that kind of attributed where we are now from that perspective, just so I can understand, too, and I think I forget which colleague brought this up about how our agencies work together. Like, when we have DPI and we have construction for one of our agencies, do you guys have a direct connection with someone in depot to help these issues not to happen? Do we go through the normal processes with our agencies just because we hear this with our businesses? But we really don't want for this to be costing us money. As you know, my colleague Fisher just mentioned, like, we spend a lot of money in the school system and our own processes elongating the project and costing us money at the end of the day. Yeah. So we absolutely have a partnership with our partners over at DPI department permitting, inspection, enforcement, you know, as part of the comprehensive design review process. It goes through multiple agencies. So this isn't a situation where it is one agency that has attributed to the delay. It's just, in essence, the process and some of the processes you have to go through process a in order to start processing b before you can start process c, D, etcetera. Right. And then I think that is a part of it. But no, in terms of our partnership, we have a great relationship with them, with D PI, we're working weekly, we meet with them to just get through some of these priorities, to make sure that everyone's on target in terms of what the next deliverable are, whether it's from our contractors, our engineers, etcetera, and to make sure that our partners are well informed and that their staff is prepared for any future reviews, et cetera, that we would need from them as well. I hear you, but I do think that's an area for us council members to think about and look at when it comes to, especially projects that we're paying for. Another thing, there was a section here that said for it kind of was a snapshot of everything on page 132 where it kind of tells us what projects are increased, decreased project delays, etcetera. And so around major repairs, it talks about a decrease there. Is that because we're doing less repairs, just because it was also noted that there's inflation, so pretty much everything's going to go up. So I'm just trying to reconcile, while we're spending less in major repairs. So I'm going to say that that's attributed to multiple factors. I think definitely the cost for Suitland is pulling from a lot of, I'm sorry, this is for across the board, not just Suitland. No, but that's what I'm saying. So the cost of Suitland is pulling funding from other categories as well to make sure that we can fund and afford Suitland high school, but then also costs, you know, where we are today with, you know, capital improvements. I'll just say for, again, this is vice chair, I know you'll be having this conversation, your committee, for us to think, think about just because what we also don't want to see is us not spending the money we need in major repairs and then seeing like a higher rate of issues with our schools. And then we're in this position where we need to now build new schools and have major renovations that. So it's just kind of like a chicken before the chicken or egg situation. What's happening first? And so I know that there's budget cuts, but doing it from major repairs might have, like, unintended consequences. And then the last question I had is the process for the new schools that are in the queue, if you just go over what that process is, because we have the P three, which was separate from how schools were selected from what's in the queue now, am I correct on that? Like, the standard was different. Good afternoon.

Like, the standard was different. Good afternoon. So I do want to go back on the major repairs comment because I understand where you're coming from. And I just also want to note that the historic underfunding of maintenance absolutely has contributed to the amount of need we have. But it is greater than just major repairs. Right. It's also in the operating budget, the maintenance available there as well. And yeah, major repairs is something we use to fill in the gap, and it is high school, but it's also the fact that the entire modernization program in 20, $14 was going to take $425 million a year in new appropriations. So falling quite a bit short of that. We do have to make some juggles. So then when Suitland comes in, the flagship school that it was designed to be the crown jewel, you know, prior to the pandemic, where we knew just how much that would cost. Yeah, it's sucking up a lot of the budget, and we're not really comfortable with those repercussions for major repairs either, because we depend on that category. So that was a very valid question. The other question is all of the schools are p three as well, are being. Are following the master plan cycles, the educational facility master plan, the outside external study of educational adequacy, how well the schools are performing as schools in addition to how well their facility condition is, and then also how overutilized or underutilized they are, since all of those things combined affect how effective a facility is to educate. So we haven't, we don't have separate processes for determining who's getting a new school. We're always following that data. So were the ones that were selected for p three just next in the queue? Because maybe this is where I'm not understanding, because I thought that it was a little bit different because it didn't have to follow the regulations that we currently have for schools. Speak to the phase one of the p three, and those were cycle one modernization schools. And one thing I'm not sure I'm getting everybody to say who they are, and we do need to move on to other questioners. And I know the superintendent has a limited time, so go right ahead. The identify yourself. I'm sorry. Jason Washington, associate superintendent of supporting services. So the phase two, the way that it was set up, is that they all came out of the EFMP, but as the selection process with IEC, they focused on what schools were ripe for consolidation as well. And so, so while every school is identified through the EFMP phase cycle one, they also pulled in cycle two schools if it would help to address what they considered educational adequacy. And so that's, but we didn't necessarily jump the line or anything from any other school. Once we finish with the Suitland and with the phase two of the p three, actually, all of these cycle one schools will have been addressed either through stage renovations, the p three, or the CIP, and then we are able to re rack and move to cycle two. So this is what the p three allowed us to do was to the eight schools that we're addressing in phase two equals 15 schools that we're impacting. And so that's the, that was the trade off necessarily in terms of consolidations and moving and pulling schools in, but we were still following the EFMP in terms of driving what schools we were going to focus on, et cetera. Thank you. I will note, I wish phase two did, you know, have schools in central and south county. But I do appreciate the response. Jason, before you go, your council member Orialla raised something that your colleague really didn't hit on about Suitland high school that you all, when he spoke about the weekly meeting is not just with D PI. I see the chair of the planning board. You have parking planning, planning officials there. You have the department of Environment. You have WSSC. You even have all the major contractors and engineers. Everyone is at the table talking about it so that there will not be any delays or their issues. Everyone's talking to each other. So I want my colleague from district seven to know that all of you all are meeting weekly to deal with those issues. So that's very important because she was concerned, as we all are, if we behind because of, and we're losing out on money and everything. So I wanted to bring that up with you standing there.

Thank you, madam chair. And thank you, mister House, for your team. Your leadership wanted to let me ask a more targeted question about the VLT. Unspent VLT money from previous years to projects that were paid for by other means. It's mentioned that you need legislation to reallocate those funds. From whom do you need legislation to reallocate those funds? US General assembly. Who needs to legislate that? Couldn't quite hear all of the question, but I think Mister Matlock heard enough to be able to provide an answer. Good afternoon. Sean Matlock, director of the Office of Alternative Infrastructure Planning and Development. The county council has to pass this legislation. It's a typical reallocation bill that needs to be passed in order for us to use the VLT money that was not used for the projects that were originally slated. We had already used capital funds for that money, and so that money was left over and we wanted to use that, reallocate it to other projects that, that have a need. That's basically it. Will you all be sending that to us? I believe so. I think that's going to be through the office of OMB will be when we do our reallocation budget. Okay, so that's going to happen during this coming reconciliation or it's going to happen during this budget process right now, I assume the reconciliation. I believe the reconciliation. I think that's correct, yes. Okay. In terms of a couple of questions, I think you all mainly answered the p three question. In terms of phase two, it seems like where it stands right now, you're still in contract negotiations with the selected developer, is that right? So we're in the exclusive negotiation period. So we've selected the developer, they're putting together their GMP, we're putting together the funding models, and we're working on the MoU, the four party MoU with the state, IEC, MSA, and the county. So that's where we are right now. We're expected to be out of the period in June, and we're hoping to have a commercial close at the end of June. Okay. And the MoU, I think I was in the impression the MoU was supposed to happen earlier in the process. Is this where the MoU was expected to happen? We'd hoped to have the MoU closed earlier. However, the parties have had issues and we've had to work through those issues in order to get to an MoU that we think we can close. There's a meeting scheduled for tomorrow to wrap up the last remaining issues and we should be able to close the MoU by the end of May. Okay. In terms of and there's one last question, because, I mean, I have a million questions, but I'm only going to ask one last one. I know this is mostly focused on CIP, but I want to ask an operating budget question. I know that the Kirwan funding is supposed to go to a number of areas that are to help our young people. So two questions. First question is, are you seeing a real benefit yet from the significant increase in funding from Kirwan, from the current new funding formula? If so, how are those increases helping? How are you seeing those increases materialize in terms of achievement so far? That's the first question. Thank you for that question, and I can address the first part in terms of the funding. My name is Lisa Howell. I'm the chief financial officer for fiscal year 25 budget. The funding that we're getting relating to blueprint is actually, it is increasing over the previous year, but is a smaller increase relative to the years we've had before into the years that we're expecting. Some subsequent part of the funding formulas are driven by student enrollment or student count for certain student groups, and is also driven by a per pupil amount.

How are you seeing those increases materialize in terms of achievement so far? That's the first question. Thank you for that question, and I can address the first part in terms of the funding. My name is Lisa Howell. I'm the chief financial officer for fiscal year 25 budget. The funding that we're getting relating to blueprint is actually, it is increasing over the previous year, but is a smaller increase relative to the years we've had before into the years that we're expecting. Some subsequent part of the funding formulas are driven by student enrollment or student count for certain student groups, and is also driven by a per pupil amount. And the per pupil amount for 2025 is a smaller increase than we've had in the previous years and the years to come. So there is a year over year increase, but it is a smaller increase that we've received. And the same thing relating to the student count that drives a lot of the funding to the school, school system. The formula such that that student count actually dipped in fiscal year 2025 across the state for all leas in the formula. So it was an unintended consequence of the way in which the formula was written, and so it was really less than a 1% increase across the board relating to student funding. So we have continued to leverage our student based budgeting model that we've had in place for years, which is actually very similar to the blueprint legislation, which is where the funding follows the student. And so we've continued to use that as our framework to help allocate the funding to the schools. And so as the enrollment increases, the amount of funds for those schools are following the student accordingly. And so we're going to continue with the blueprint implementation, not only for 25, but it's going to be a long process as this continues to evolve to ensure the funds are getting to where they need to go based on the attributes of the students, and then I'm sure there'll be academic outcomes that follows that as well. Formula also went down, or is it going to be smaller increase than expected. What was the reason for that? Specifically, our foundation formula, which is the funding that we get for every single student, is driven by student student count. And that student count is the greater of a three year average of our September 30 enrollment or the September 30 enrollment for that current year. So for fiscal year 25, that three year average was based off of school year 2019 2020, which was pre pandemic year. And then the two years after that, fiscal year 20, we were held harmless because of the pandemic. But we had pre pandemic enrollment included in that three year average, which bumped it up. Excuse me? Which bumped it up in fiscal year 2024. So that three year average in 24 had the benefit of pre pandemic enrollment count in that number for fiscal year 25. That pre pandemic year rolled out of that three year average. So now you're dealing with three years of lower enrollment compared to our 930 enrollment. And so that three year average, which had been higher than our September 30 count, is now, for the first time in fiscal year 25, lower. So therefore, we ended up going with our September 30 actual student count. And so it is actually a decrease compared to the previous year. Got it. Okay. So it's a Covid related hiccup, if you will. Yep, absolutely. Gotcha. Okay. And in terms of how that funding has helped improve achievement, have we seen real benefits from the fair one formula, funding improving achievement yet? I missed that last. We'll have you to repeat that question, hopefully just a little bit louder. So, have we seen any benefits in terms of academic achievement from the increased funding we've gotten due to the Kirwan formula? Thank you for that question. Hi. My name is Judy White. I'm the chief academic officer for Prince George's county public Schools. We're currently in the process of identifying, as Chief Howe indicated, where our current funds are allocated into our schools. So therefore, we're in the middle of planning and ensuring that all blueprint obligations are met. Because of that, and because the blueprint is so comprehensive, you will begin to see over the next several years, us laying out of plans of how we're going to attack that. So to attach achievement to it right in this moment is not something we would do. What we'll be doing right now is identifying where we are against where Kirwan is asking us to be and identifying where those gaps are and what we will be doing over the next three years to begin to identify and attack those gaps. As chief Howe indicated, as we go into the school year and begin to implement that work, we will be able to start looking at where we started and where we're going, and we'll be monitoring that throughout every single year moving forward. Are there benchmarks that Kermit is already asking you to have met in terms of achievement? So what it has asked us to do is to put in place a plan that we will attack from our entire system. It's a global plan because Kirwan touches so many avenues within our school district. As a part of that plan, across the different pillars, we are identifying the strategies that we're attacking. We're also identifying the challenges that we have in each year where we're being tasked so far to identify where we are against those challenges and what we're going to do moving forward to address them.

We're also identifying the challenges that we have in each year where we're being tasked so far to identify where we are against those challenges and what we're going to do moving forward to address them. So that's where we are right now. However, what I would say is that we have a benchmark through our state assessments every single year and through our own strategic plan, we have our own CSI obligation that we are working to ensure that every single subgroup in our district is moving. And that is something that we utilize our own internal benchmarks for. To monitor ourselves towards growth and to monitor ourselves towards movement. On that state test, we can probably have right here. Let me ask for my final question, because as I said, I have many. But let me just. Final question. As you all know, Glenargan woods was rated the top performing elementary school in the state. And that was a significant achievement, I think. Is there any sense of how we expect to multiply that success to other parts of the county, to other schools? The all tag model. Is there a. Is there a. I know there are always debates about, you know, is that too elite of a model? I'm of the mindset that we need more and more models like that. Do we have any sense of how we plan to multiply the success of a Glenard woods across the county? Sure. So what I would first say is, as a system, we are extremely proud of Glenarten Woods. Glenarm woods is one of our comprehensive tag programs. So in our school district, our students have an opportunity to test for tag at several grades. In elementary school, they start the tag program at second grade. We have several schools that students can enter into or their parents can for lottery access to our tag center programs. That means that every single child in that building, grades two through five, are tag identified. However, any other student in our school district that is not in one of. I think it's about programs. We have tag programs in our schools. So what we do look at in terms of our tag students is across every single school, the state requires us to look at subgroups. So part of that is looking at our tag students in every single school and looking at how they're pacing. Our expectation is that all of our tag students would pace at where Glenarten woods is pacing. That is a single tag, comprehensive location. However, I would also add to that, though, that part of our obligation as a school system is to say, regardless if they're tagged or not, what are the good practices? What's the good pedagogy? What are the good strategies we see in that school? Where do we see those elevate other places? And how can we use some of those teachers to be trainer of trainers to our teachers to begin to implement and replicate those strategies throughout our school district? Right. That is the approach. The question is, is that something that we're successfully doing? I guess is my question. So our team is out always looking through learning walks. Do we work with our school side together to see, because not just in Glenarten woods, we have many schools, whether they're tag identified or not, that are performing well. And so our obligation is to really see what are the good practices? Where do they live? Where do they exist? We have to also look at what are the leaders in that building doing? Because leadership monitors of instruction matters. It's not something that we do as a one time. It's something that we will continue to do if we want to see growth. And then I think the flip side of that is where do we not see that, right? And then how do we measure that against the practices we see in those buildings, and how do we elevate and build solid processes and procedures in those schools to constantly get better? When we think about achievement, achievement is not a one time thing. We could have a school that achieves very high in the next year fall. So our constant lens on it has to grow in terms of the comprehensive programs. You know, as we continue to build on new schools, we will have a continued opportunity to also see where we can put an influx of those type of programs as well. But I just think we have an obligation to look in every single school, every single classroom, and monitor instruction every single day to get better. That has to be the formula, and we can't take our foot off the pedal for that. I definitely agree, and I think everybody here would agree. I just, you know, 30 years from now, if we're still talking about the fact that we're second from the bottom or third from the bottom of the state, I think we'll all feel like we failed and I'm just speaking candid with everybody in the room right now. You know, I've been on the council for over 14 years and we're having the same conversations we had when I was a first year councilmember. And I'm sure, you know, I can't speak for Mister Noga or Mister Olson in terms of conversations they had before I was on the council, but these sound very similar and it just does not feel like we're making significant progress in terms of over the long term. And, you know, I think the expectations are going to go up as the current funding continues to increase, as we continue to see more expectations for the counties to submit more funding for Kirwan, I think the expectations and the pressure are going to go up that we don't just have sort of the same conversations ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Kermit", "insights": [{"observation": "Kermit is asking to put in place a plan that will attack from the entire system.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Identify strategies and challenges each year and address them moving forward.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Benchmark through state assessments every single year and monitor towards growth.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Glenarten Woods", "insights": [{"observation": "Glenarten Woods was rated the top performing elementary school in the state.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Students have the opportunity to test for tag at several grades and have lottery access.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "State requires looking at subgroups for tag students pacing.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Regardless if they're tagged or not, use good practices and pedagogy throughout the school district.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Trainer of trainers to implement and replicate strategies throughout the school district.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Constant lens on achievement to grow comprehensive programs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Kirwan", "insights": [{"observation": "As current funding continues to increase, expectations and pressures on counties for more funding for Kirwan are going up.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Kermit", "insights": [{"observation": "Kermit is asking to put in place a plan that will attack from the entire system.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Identify strategies and challenges each year and address them moving forward.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Benchmark through state assessments every single year and monitor towards growth.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Glenarten Woods", "insights": [{"observation": "Glenarten Woods was rated the top performing elementary school in the state.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Students have the opportunity to test for tag at several grades and have lottery access.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "State requires looking at subgroups for tag students pacing.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Regardless if they're tagged or not, use good practices and pedagogy throughout the school district.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Trainer of trainers to implement and replicate strategies throughout the school district.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Constant lens on achievement to grow comprehensive programs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Kirwan", "insights": [{"observation": "As current funding continues to increase, expectations and pressures on counties for more funding for Kirwan are going up.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 2713800, "chunk_end_time": 3072216, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3526?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3526?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=2713"}, {"start": 44000, "end": 50000, "text": " think everybody here would agree.

So I am hopeful that we can continue to be innovative, think outside the box, come up with a different outcome than we've seen over the last, again, ten to 20 years. But thank you. You know, we agree with you. When we look at our gaps and we look at our special education population, our multilingual learners, Kirwan gives us an opportunity to look at that differently. It gives us an opportunity to work with our families differently. As we approach this, I think we all have to keep in mind too, is when we look at our district. Our district. District is not like many of the districts in our state. If you really break apart some of our data, our data says that the students in which we serve, that we have the majority of, we outpace everyone else in the state of Maryland. We just had the majority of those students here in Prince George's county. However, we 100% agree with you. We don't want to be in that category either. Our goal has to be how do we use the funds and how do we use the legislation to ensure that what we're putting in front of children is the best it can be. That is an obligation that we have and we'll continue to work towards that. And the point you just made is a point that we've been making for, like I said, ten to 20 years. We do have a higher percentage of the kids who have higher needs. And absolutely, that's always been true. And if you break those apart, as you said, and we said this again, this is conversation we've had for many, many, many, many years. If you break those apart, those demographics apart, we're performing consistent with, or if they're not better than other jurisdictions, but we have those higher needs here and that's what we have to figure out how to address. So it's not just even a comparison with what other jurisdictions in the state are doing, it's looking around the nation of other jurisdictions that have similar populations. And what are we all doing to put our heads together to better serve black and brown kids? To better serve kids who have high needs? In terms of socioeconomic needs, these are the same issues we've been dealing with my entire tenure in the council, and I'm sure before that, and I think my frustration is they really haven't changed. We really haven't really progressed that far. And so I'm hopeful that we'll see some change with the substantial increase in funding that Kirwan is going to lead to. Thank you. Excellent points, Mister Franklin and doctor White, I can see that you did in fact graduate from High Point High school. Very impressive. That's right. Thank you so much council member Watson and then council member Olson. And then we are going to let you go after that. Yes, I'll be brief with Maya. I just have one question, but I did want to make a comment to Mister House. I want to say thank you so much for what you all did, for keeping Pointer Ridge elementary school open. Greatly appreciate that and your partnership, as well as bringing friendship charter school to Bowie. So thank you so much. My question is in regard to the school board members. So the legislation requires the current appointed school board members to leave office by July 1. So I just wanted to find out what your plan is, you know, on electing a new board chair and vice chair, and just overall, you know, what your thoughts and plan are for that. So thank you. Thank you for that question. The board is actually currently going through that process. They'll be having some closed session information that they'll provide from the chair and vice chair to the rest of the board. And I'm sure that they will be moving forward into open session to share that publicly. But that time is moving forward, of course, with the expectation in the legislation right now is that by July 1 that the board would be a fully, fully elected board. The board is very aware of that. They are working through a transition plan as we speak, and I'm sure that they'll be sharing that information publicly very soon. Councilman Olson. Thank you, madam chair. Thank you, Superintendent House. Just a few questions. I see William Wert middle school is. Well, I guess it's a little bit behind, but it is scheduled to be done very soon. Should we be expecting that? That will open this August. I'd like for Jason Washington to come to the podium and share some insight around William Worth. Yes. So it will be opening right now. We are targeting to hit substantial completion mid July. So we expect we'll be moving and having move activities in early August. So students will be going back to school. Students will be moving into the new school, and then they will be demoing the existing school this fall. Okay. All right. Love to talk with you offline about some of that and sort of what is the transition? What is the, as one goes down right next to the other side school, how that happens.

Councilman Olson. Thank you, madam chair. Thank you, Superintendent House. Just a few questions. I see William Wert middle school is. Well, I guess it's a little bit behind, but it is scheduled to be done very soon. Should we be expecting that? That will open this August. I'd like for Jason Washington to come to the podium and share some insight around William Worth. Yes. So it will be opening right now. We are targeting to hit substantial completion mid July. So we expect we'll be moving and having move activities in early August. So students will be going back to school. Students will be moving into the new school, and then they will be demoing the existing school this fall. Okay. All right. Love to talk with you offline about some of that and sort of what is the transition? What is the, as one goes down right next to the other side school, how that happens. But very glad to hear that that's happening this fall. And you might want to stay there. Glen Ridge elementary as well. That's opening this August as well. Is that correct? New Glen Ridge Middle school. Glen Ridge Middle school. I'm sorry. It would be opening as well. Glen Ridge. It will expect it, I think substantial completion is the end of June, and since then, that is a new school. It will literally be just opening to a new boundary. But it will be, both schools will be opening this fall, and that boundary is set and students have been verified and all that. Okay. And the fence, wall, shrubbery with the neighborhood is going to be all set by that time, as far as I'm aware. Everything is on track. Yes, sir. Yes, it is. Yes. Thank you. And then last, last question is Parkdale High School's field. I remember when I got back on the council this most recent time that there was supposed to be something happening with that field, that it's in bad shape. But I don't see. I haven't seen anything in here about that. And I know Mister Noga has Laurel High School feel, which is also in pretty abysmal shape, or at least it was a year ago. But I'll let him talk to his high school. I can answer. We had a fire. I'm saying. Stephanie, director of maintenance, I believe what you're referring to is we had a fire on a field at Parkdale last year, and we, the fire department responded, did a great job. In the meantime, they destroyed the baseball field, so we had to completely rebuild it. That's all complete and everything is ready to go. And they should be able to use that field, if that's what you're referring to. Well, I guess I'm not sure about the fire, but the field itself, the football, soccer, you know, lacrosse field, that. The condition of that field is that all been restored and, yes, playable. And we have a rock that maintains our football field. So they routinely go through and we just won't went through our spring cleanup. But I can check on it for you and get back to you. Great. I mean, maybe I'll even go out there at some point in the coming days or weeks to take a look at it, but my impression was it was not in very good condition. So maybe if you could check into that as well. Yes, sir. Okay. All right. I can add some additional context to that. I'm Will Smith, project management supervisor for the Department of Capital programs. And so, Parkdale is part of our comprehensive stadium renovation program. Currently, we are looking at. We're in design for Frederick Douglass. We have Crossland, we have Duvall High School. I do believe Parkdale is after Duval High school, or would be maybe the fourth one. But at this point, currently we don't have funding for that project, but it hasn't been approved and submitted for. At this point, once we do submit that request and get approval for it, then we'll move forward. Forward with the total comprehensive state of renovation of that complex. I think some of that is also kind of currently working through the CCAP program and identifying exactly what our position is going to be going forward with installing turf field versus just natural grass. And so those are things that we're working through at this point. Okay. Yeah. And I'm not even talking about turf. I'm just talking about, you know, the playable condition of the field and dirt and rocks and, you know, that kind of thing to make sure it's safe for people to play on. Understood. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, madam chair. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time and attention, and we will see you on Monday. We appreciate you as well and look forward to working together. Thank you very much. Okay, colleagues, let's go back to the agenda. We have CR 39 2024, a resolution concerning juvenile and minor curfew zones for the purpose of authorizing the police chief to create a force zone. Pardon, to interrupt.

The step that is anticipated today is once you hear the staff's summation of the testimony and the planning board's recommendation, we would be looking to this body to make a motion as to a recommendation for preparation of a document which will finalize your consideration of these proposed designations. So I'll turn it over to the planning board, excuse the planning department staff to sort of give you an in depth examination of what we got on public hearing. Thank you. Do we have our slides that we prepared? Great. Thank you. Good afternoon, chair Ivey, vice chair Harrison, and members of the council. For the record, my name is Casey Roane, planner three with the historic preservation section in the planning department. Im here to present the transcript analysis for the proposed historic site designations of three properties in College park the Nancy Tabbs House at 5011 Navajo street, documented property 6001 the Elwood and Wilmer Gross House at 5110 Pierce Avenue, documented properties, 660 zero two and the George Henry and Agnes Gross House at 8254th Avenue documented properties 660 zero three, and I'll really briefly review these three sites. First is the Nancy Tabbs House, a Tudor revival style dwelling built circa 1935. Full descriptions and historical narratives for each of these sites were provided to the council members at the time of the joint public hearing. Here is an aerial view of the Nancy Tabbs House showing its location within the City of College park. This is within councilmanic district three. The historic Preservation Commission reviewed this matter at its public hearing on December 19, 2023. Staff presented its conclusion that the property could be found to meet five of the nine designation criteria of County Code section 29 104 A, which are shown here on the screen. Based on staff's recommendation and the support of the property owner applicants, the HPC recommended to the planning board and the district council that the Nancy Tapper House and its 0.266 acre environmental setting, lot ten of block 13 in Lakeland, be designated a Prince George's county historic site. The second site is the Elwood and Wilmer Gross House, a contemporary style, split level kit house built circa 1962. Here is an aerial view of the property's location within College park. Again, we're still in California. Manic district three at the HPC's December 19, 2023 public hearing, staff presented its conclusion that the property can be found to meet four of the nine designation criteria shown here on the screen, and the HPC recommended to the planning board and the district council that the Elwood and Wilmer Gross House and its 0.241 acre environmental setting be designated as a Prince George's County Historical Historic site. The third property is the George Henry and Agnes Gross House, a raised ranch built in 1970. Here is an aerial view of the property adjacent to the Elwood and Wilmer Gross house next door, still within councilmanic District three in the City of College park. At its December 19, 2023 public hearing, HBC heard a staff presentation of as conclusions that the property meets four of the nine designation criteria of section 29,104 and the HPC recommended to the planning board and the district council about the George Henry and Agnes Gross House and its 0.186 acre environmental setting be designated a Prince George's county historic site. A joint public hearing on the three proposed designations was held by the district council and Planning Board on March 12. Planning department staff presented the historical and architectural significance of the three properties and presented the HBC's favorable recommendations. The property owners, Maxine and Delphine Gross, were present at the hearing and written testimony in support of the proposed designations was received from Robert Thurston, the president of the Lakeland Civic Association Bader, the planning director with the City of College park, and from G. Harris, and no other testimony was received before the close of the record on March 27. Following the joint public hearing on April 11, 2024, the planning board voted five to zero to recommend to the district council that the Nancy Tapps House, the Elwood and Wilmer Gross House, and the George Henry and Agnes Gross House be designated as Prince George's county historic sites. That brings us to today's meeting and concludes the planning department staff presentation, and I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you. Thank you so much. Is there a motion for preparation of a resolution? Thank you. Yes, I move for the preparation of a document of approval. All right, we have Councilmember Olson made the motion, council member Fisher made the second.

And Madam chair, while I have the miC, if I could correct the record on CR 39 and CR 30. Those motions carried 801. I miscalculated. Thank you so much. Next we have transcript analysis, proposed amendments to the endorsed Bowie, Mitchellville and Vicinity Sectional Map Amendment, CR 89 2022 and CR 84 2023. Digest of testimony this public meeting is part of an ongoing process to consider and approve proposed Bowie Mitchell Vicinity sectional map amendment with certain specific zoning classification proposals. The council's discussion of potential action on the proposed Bowie, Mitchellville and vicinity sectional map amendment may include, but is not limited to, whether the council should make changes to the recommendations of the planning board and approving the endorsed sectional map amendment. And we will go to to Karen Zabakos for an overview. Thank you, madam chair. Good afternoon, members of the committee. Yes, once again, we are here to hear the transcript analysis and review the digest of joint public hearing testimony as to the second public hearing on the Bowie Mitchell bill and vicinity sectional map amendment. As you'll recall very briefly in the procedural history, this was your second public hearing. Your first joint public hearing was conducted in the early part of 2023. Then at the time of this function, wherein the staff comes and discusses the recommendation of planning board as the proposal, as well as what we received within the record of testimony, this council opted to direct staff to prepare a resolution declaring the need for additional joint public hearing as to 16 annunciated amendments to what was endorsed by the planning board after the first public hearing. So this year we conducted a second joint public hearing as to those 16 amendments. The record closed. The planning board has also done, dutifully done, their recommendation as to the 16 proposed amendments. The limited record, excuse me, the record of testimony being limited to the 16 proposed amendments, and they transmitted their recommendations to the council where we land here when the. Remember, the comprehensive zoning proposals for this are driven by the master plan plan, which was approved by the council in 2022. So that's before this council took its seats. But those recommendations approved in the master plan drove the recommendations here. And the reason I bring that up is because this process has gone a little differently than typically seen. We typically see the master plan and the comprehensive zoning part of it go together. They're not necessarily authorized to move independently, but it seems to be a good way to do it. And so there was a need to do it separately this time, because when the master plan was started, you had your countywide map amendment pending. So county law in your procedures for you from being able to consider new comprehensive zoning changes while you had an entire zoning map amendment encompassing the entire county before you. So we're here. We're going to hear the presentation from the staff and what the planning board did on these 16 amendments at the conclusion of which you can have discussion. And if there is readiness, you may make a motion like you saw with the historic, excuse me, the historic designation presentation. Or you, since you have time. The last date of action for rendering a decision on this comprehensive zoning sectional map amendment is June 11. If it's the will of the body, you may simply take it under advisement. Alrighty, so I turn it over to Mister Lester and Mister McCune of the park and planning. Thank you and good afternoon, district council chair and members of the district council. For the record, my name is Thomas Lester with the Prince George's County Planning Department Community Planning Division. I'm the project manager for the sectional map, and I'm joined today by Kiara McCune, supervisor of the master plans and studies section. So we're here today to review the planning board comments on the proposed amendments previously presented and to consider the testimony provided at the February 13 joint public hearing. In short, the planning board recommended implementing the 2022 Bowie, Mitchellville and Vicinity master plan as it was approved and and opposed all 16 amendments. To summarize, during the September work sessions held last year, staff were directed by the county council to draft 16 amendments to the endorsed SMA. The county council and the planning board held the second joint public hearing on February 13 to receive public comment on the amendments.

Pursuant to the zoning ordinance, planning Board is given the opportunity to provide comments to the council on those amendments, and overall, staff recommended that the planning board maintain their position to implement the master plan as it was approved and oppose the 16 amendments. I'm now briefly going to review each of the amendments. So amendment one, the proposed amendment is to retain the RR CGO split zoning for the two properties that make a free state shopping center. The planning board opposes this amendment and recommends rezoning the entire property to the CGO zone. Next up, we have amendment two, which is the Keller property. The amendment is to rezone the Keller property to the CGO zone instead of retaining the RR zone. The planning board's position is to oppose the amount amendment and retain the existing RR zone for amendment three, which is the former Wellands property. The proposed amendment is to retain the Wellings property in the re zone instead of rezoning to the CS zone, but the planning board's position is to oppose the amendment and rezone the property to the CS zone. Next up, we have amendment four, which is the boys and Girls Club property. The proposed amendment is to rezone the property to the AG zone instead of retaining the RS zone.

This is amendment nine and it's to retain the property in the AR zone. Instead of rezoning to the CS zone, the planning board's position is to rezone it to the CS zone. Amendment ten, which is the Franks former Franks nursery property, the proposed amendment is to retain the re zone. The planning board's position is to rezone a it to the CGO zone. Amendment eleven, which is an MNCPC property, this proposed amendment is to rezone the property to the Ros zone.

That concludes staff's presentations. Thank you. I can take any questions? Thank you so much. Is there a go first? Are there any questions? Is there a motion for preparation of a resolution? Madam Chair, I'd just like to say thank you for the presentation, and we would like to take this under advisement. Okay, we will take that under advisement.

The sponsors are Fisher, Harrison, Hawkins, and Watson. And we will now have an overview by Raina Hightower. Good afternoon again, Madam Chair. CR 24 2024 was introduced on April 2, 2024. A public hearing was held and testimony was received. Written testimony received is located on pages 181 through 185 of your committee of the whole virtual binder. Also, the draft action plan is located located on pages 22 through 171 of your virtual binder. The Office of Audits and Investigations submitted a policy analysis and fiscal impact statement indicating that adoption of this resolution would offset revenues and expenditures for $9,727,209 in federal funds. Excuse me, in federal grant funds, specifically for CDBG, home and ESG projects. Also, this resolution aligns with the county's plan 2035 goals and will focus on initial goals set in place by the FY 2021 through 2025 consolidated plan to prioritize affordable housing in economic development, rental assistance, as well as homeowners assistance. Also, we have. Director Espolia is here from the department of Housing and Community Development to present to you possibly a PowerPoint or discuss the action plan. Thank you, Director Kospolia. Great. It's great to be with you. I don't have the PowerPoint. We went through all of that during the budget session. So this is a process we do every year. And this part of us receiving the entitlement funds from HUD, the total amount that you see of 10,000,173, 525 is based on last year's allocation. We have not received yet this year's allocation. HUD said that it's forthcoming. We do expect it to be about the same amount. But I want to be clear that we will send you a draft two as soon as we receive the final number. If there is more money, we're going to do a pro rata adjustment up. If it is less money, we're going to do a pro rata adjustment down to the CTBGA location. And also they're going to tell us exactly how much ESG and home funds we will get, and the full recommendations are included in attachment a of the resolution. And I will be happy to answer any questions you have. Thank you. Are there any questions, councilmember Olson? Okay, and I'm sorry, are we on CBG? Okay, that's what I thought. Thank you. Full day. Madam chair, I just wanted to ask about neighborhood design center, which I know last year we were also in the same situation. They did not get any funds or were not recommended for funds in CDBG. I know there's a lot of worthy organizations out there, so I understand how things are difficult. I will just say that neighbor design center is extremely helpful and useful to our communities. And, and as we're looking at community development, they are the epitome of community development in working with neighborhood groups and nonprofits to enhance and improve our communities, and we rely on them. So I would have liked to have seen them get funding through CDBG. I understand at this point that means pulling from some of the others that have been recommended, and I'm not sure that we want to make that sausage here now, but can you just explain a little bit about the thinking in terms of not getting. Oh, absolutely. And I do want to, in full disclosure, in my previous life, back in 2006, 70, eight, when I was in the design field myself, I used to volunteer for NDC. So I'm intimately familiar of the group. Great work they do, and we have a lot of respect as a department on what they bring for the communities. CTBG admin funds are explicitly set aside for the administration of the CTBG eligible activities. So the kind of projects NDC has recently done in Prince George's county are not necessarily CTPG projects. So we have, and administrative compliance matters. So I'm not suggesting that they should not be funded generally from other things. This specific source of CTBG admin funds can only be used for administrative support of CTBG eligible projects. And in the future, we had talked with them. If they were to work with the community on a streetscape project and be the designers of that project, they can come as a full package under public facilities infrastructure and be part of that budget. And so that way we could fund, like we fund other architects, or if they were going to do acquisition, rehab, work with other nonprofit organizations and be part of that development team, they could be part of that effort, and they can be funded as part of that. But as a set aside of a CDPG administration, we have to set aside that money for only CTPG administration, which includes environmental reviews, it includes compliance. So it is not a good match. Besides the fact that this year we didn't have any money, but it is truly an administrator compliance matter. And I do believe everything you said about NDC. I think they're wonderful and I'm sure you do. I have no doubt. Well, thank you. I hope you get have a conversation with NDC because they are one of the gems, you know, out there and hopefully we can find a way to, you know, get them money. I know we're certainly, I certainly would be advocating. I think the chair is as well for other sources of funding. But, but please do speak with NDC. Thank you, madam chair. Well, on the heels of that, I'm just curious, how did they get funding through CDBG in the past? Were they doing something different? So I believe many years ago there was an agreement for them to do CDBg projects, technical assistance. And so that was the initial conception of this effort. And current efforts of their work have moved away from that compon", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Prince George's County Community Development", "insights": [{"observation": "Adoption of CR 24 2024 resolution aligns with the county's plan 2035 goals and will focus on initial goals set in place by the FY 2021 through 2025 consolidated plan to prioritize affordable housing in economic development, rental assistance, as well as homeowners assistance.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Director Espolia mentioned that entitlement funds received from HUD will be adjusted pro rata depending on the amount.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The Director highlighted the importance of administrative compliance matters in funding CDBG eligible projects, suggesting that Neighborhood Design Center (NDC) can come under public facilities infrastructure for future funding.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Neighborhood Design Center (NDC)", "insights": [{"observation": "NDC did not get recommended for funds in CDBG although they are extremely helpful and useful to the communities.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "NDC can potentially be funded as part of public facilities infrastructure if they participate in streetscape projects or collaborate with nonprofits on acquisition and rehab projects.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Prince George's County Community Development", "insights": [{"observation": "Adoption of CR 24 2024 resolution aligns with the county's plan 2035 goals and will focus on initial goals set in place by the FY 2021 through 2025 consolidated plan to prioritize affordable housing in economic development, rental assistance, as well as homeowners assistance.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Director Espolia mentioned that entitlement funds received from HUD will be adjusted pro rata depending on the amount.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The Director highlighted the importance of administrative compliance matters in funding CDBG eligible projects, suggesting that Neighborhood Design Center (NDC) can come under public facilities infrastructure for future funding.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Neighborhood Design Center (NDC)", "insights": [{"observation": "NDC did not get recommended for funds in CDBG although they are extremely helpful and useful to the communities.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "NDC can potentially be funded as part of public facilities infrastructure if they participate in streetscape projects or collaborate with nonprofits on acquisition and rehab projects.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 5307380, "chunk_end_time": 5763456, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3526?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3526?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=5307"}, {"start": 79000, "end": 85000, "text": "nmental reviews, it includes compliance.

Finally, we will walk you through the elements of your CIP binder and open the floor to any questions or items you would like to discuss further. We strive to address the following four priorities in the FY 25 CIP be good stewards of our existing assets fully fund the implementation of current projects, grow and change our inventory to meet the needs of current and future residents, and equitably distribute those resources and facilities. Our primary focus is on existing assets, specifically playgrounds, athletic fields and trails, which are facilities that residents have the greatest access to in terms of proximity to their homes and daily use. We are implementing a new asset management approach to guide the investment prioritization in these facilities. We're still feeling the effects of historic inflation. In order to complete many of our previously funded projects, we need to supplement funding to account for current material cost increases so we can finish these projects in a timely manner. Our proposed CIP is guided by policies and recommendations in the adopted 2020 2040 Functional Master plan and the Land preservation, Parks and recreation plan. These overarching planning documents have spurred specific site and facility plans and feasibility studies that we then turn into new capital projects and finally providing additional resources to the areas of the county most in need of high quality parks and recreation. Here's a brief snapshot of some projects completed over the course of the year. There are currently 206 projects projects in the CIP, many of which include multiple projects. We will always have more work to do with such a large system and so many facilities, but we should take a moment to be proud of all that we've accomplished this year, including the construction of 15 playgrounds, a turf field, replacement field upgrades, trail replacements, a new indoor track at the sports and learning complex, two dog parks, and much more. The proposed CIP is the commission's six year financial plan for acquisition, development and improvement of capital assets. The CIP is composed of two components, the capital budget and the capital plan. The capital budget refers to expenditures planned for the first year of the CIP and provides the appropriation authority to spend those funds. The capital plan is the proposed projects and related expenditures for the remaining five years. The actual funding for those projects will not be allocated until the budget year. The CIP fund is funded in six ways. Tax revenue also called Paygo funding commission backed general obligation bonds, state funded program, open space for acquisition and development, financial contributions for developers as a condition of development approval, and other state and local and federal grants. We also fund projects by closing out prior approved completed capital projects and moving unspent funds where they exist to new projects. The graphic on the right illustrates how the CIP is created, from master planning efforts to stakeholder request to right sizing in the face of fiscal and manpower constraints. This is a herculean task. However, we wanted to address capital needs in a way to inspire, to be innovative, and to incentivize and excite our residents. We are proposing a CIP that meets the spending affordability guidelines as approved by the county spending Affordability Committee. As we show each year, this slide compares the proposed CIP presented to you in January to the the amended CIP presented to you today. As previously mentioned, the first year of the CIP is proposed funding. The outer years are for planning purposes and subject to change based on available funding and policy direction. In the amended CIP, you will note a $5.6 million increase in general obligation bond funding, a $3.25 million increase in state bond funding, a $1.2 million decrease in state funded program open space funding and a $3.5 million increase in developer funding. This has increased our amended budget to $142 million. We expect to spend $382 million over the next six years to improve our facilities and program offerings, which in turn will improve the lives of Prince Georgians. We think that the projects in the CIP are a great way to spend that funding, as we do each year. We've had the pleasure to meet with many council members individually to explain our CIP budgeting process and deep dive into district specific projects and initiatives. We've listened as much as we can within the current cycle and we've made adjustments. The changes you see on the screen reflect all of the substantive additions we've made since our initial presentation, mostly state legislative bonds and capital grants and developer funding. It's important to include large scale developer built parks in the CIP in order to realize the capital investment in our system. $2.1 million was added for the Central Avenue connect so that we could move forward with design of phase one while maintaining our match requirements for the raise grant. We also added 7.25 million for work at Wilmers park over the next two years. Madam chair, if I may too, just an additional shout out about Wimbles park specifically. As you can see, it's a substantial commitment of money and in large part that's that reflects the commitment from the county executive, from this council, especially the council leadership, and if I may single out vice chair Harrison for this as well, but also for our team. We are all in and fully committed to Wilmers park and moving that along.

We are all in and fully committed to Wilmers park and moving that along. So I didn't want to preempt Miss Worshall's presentation, but I just wanted to give that extra bit of shout out as she continues. And I'm sure there'll be questions about that when we're wrapped up. Thank you. Okay, so to conclude the presentation next, we just have a couple slides left. We want to summarize all the great work happening at parks and recreation facilities across the county and tie this work back to our three goals. We're improving the facilities of the past while growing to meet the needs of the future. These projects touch every part of the county. We are funding implementation of our master plan planning efforts throughout the county. We are making major investments in our athletic fields through the new athletic fields fund. We funded a lot of work at our historic properties in order to renovate these facilities for the public to continue to enjoy and learn their history. We continue to implement the multi generational center approach while upgrading and replacing our existing community centers. And we're adding new park facilities. And finally, we can't forget our trails and playgrounds as we continue to implement the strategic trails plan, install wayfinding signage and replace all of our aging playgrounds. So that's a $142 million investment in our county's parks and recreation facilities. Last year, there was a lot of discussion surrounding equity and location of projects. We like to give a definition of equality, meaning that each individual group of people is given the same resources or opportunities, while equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome. While we do not have equality in projects by district, we do have considerable equity of projects across the county. As part of the 2022 LPPRP, we work with the state of Maryland to develop the park equity map shown above. It shows that 22% of the value of proposed CIP projects are in low equity areas and 39% of projects are in medium to low equity areas. That's 61% of the CIP located in medium, low or low at equity areas. I want to close by walking you through your virtual binder that you received. The binder is broken into tabs for organizational purposes. The first tab is the transmittal letter. The second tab is the proposed CIP in the traditional tablecloth and chart format. This is the version of the CIP that was transmitted to the council in January. You will then find all the maps in TAB three. They include projects that were recently completed, projects currently in the work program, and proposed projects. TAB four is budget transfers from prior approved projects. When a project is completed, it sometimes closes with excess funding. We use that tab to show which projects will receive that additional funding and which projects are now closed as a result of funding moves. We also sometimes need to swap funding types. For example, pay go for bond. Those changes are also reflected in tab four. Tab five are budget adjustments. For example, we see received additional FY 24 funding from the federal government for the Marais grant. That funding came in after the budget was passed, so we will account for that now. Tab six includes the adjustments to the proposed CIP. That's everything in the table you saw earlier, bonds, pos, and additional projects. Tab seven is the amended tablecloth and chart that includes the new projects. And finally, tab eight is the project description forms. These forms, which we call pumpkin, are the output from the county system. They include description, relevant highlights, funding throughout the life of the project, funding types and planned expenditures. And with that, I will thank you for your time today, and I will pass it back to director Tyler for final comments. And thank you, Claire. And I want to say in record time, madam chair, and also that we want to thank you again for the opportunity to present our capital improvement plan. We strive to get better every time we do this, and we are pursuing excellence for sure. And we look forward to your questions and your approval. Thank you. Thank you so much, vice chair Harrison. Thank you, madam chair. Just first and foremost, I want to thank Maryland National Capital park and planning and park. I want to thank Maryland National Cavill park and planning and park and recreations for the services that they provide to the citizens of this county. You know, we serve 499 sq. Mi. As you all know, Prince George's County's park and recreation state. The awards that you all have gotten because of the types of parks that we offer our citizens here is remarkable. And so I just want to take the opportunity to thank you and furthermore, continuing to make Wilmers Park a priority. You know, I hear mister.

And park and recreations, just during black History Month, covered in the state of Maryland, all the sites that used to be part of the chitlin circuit back in the day. And so, just thinking about all the individuals that performed there, you think about the Negro baseball league that was performed there as well. We have a responsibility to continue to tell that story to future generations. Last year, unfortunately, there was funding that was available there that wasn't there. It was moved to somewhere else, and that's okay. But we now are making this a priority over the next two years to tell our story in this county. And I hope that when this is all complete, many years when I'm not here, that we'll continue to tell the story that the importance that future generations understand that the arts and humanity play in this process. And so I want to thank you for your leadership. Chairman Shapiro, Director Tyler and I look forward to continue to work with you on this. And Mister vice chair, if I may, would like to say to you that we are in lockstep with you. We realize the value of this historical property as well as the historic venue that brought us a lot of the genres that we have listened to over the years. So we are with you with that, and we appreciate you saying what you did about the department. All of us here really appreciate that, and we will be working with you to continue that legacy. Thank you. Are there any other questions? Oh, council member Oreada, thank you. Thank you for being here and your work and your presentation. I just have a few questions. One, I had the opportunity to meet with both the on CIP and recreation, kind of go through all the things and programs that we have available, and I appreciate that. One of the questions I did have, because I visited some of my sites, and I realized, like, some of, like, the basic amenities they might not have and how we go about making requests. For example, I was at ocrest, and they said they had no mics, no projectors, basic things like that. So are there audits that are done, or how do we make sure that each side has the same equipment? That would be pretty easy. All we have to do is look to our deputies and our division chiefs that are here today. They've heard you. And if there's some. Some things that are missing that you'd like to see there, then we just need to let us know, and we'll make sure that happens. Okay? Thank you. And then I want to thank Peter. We talked about, like, the project chargers in particular, and found a solution, I think, that'll work for the next fiscal year. So I want to thank you for your support and making sure that we get these projects done that are going to help our communities. I want to publicly say that I appreciate your support and hope that we get that to the finish line. Project charges are another time. I know. Go ahead and say thank you since he's here. If I may, madam chair. It is. I understand it's not relevant to CFP, but I appreciate your comments, and we are absolutely committed to working with you on that. Thank you. And then back to CIP. So one of the things that I was looking at is how we get new, I guess, either renovations or new community centers in the queue. And so for. I think it's John Edward. I wanted it to be, I guess, get a study. Right. And so what's that process is to have it in the review cycle to see what's needed. I was saying good morning. I think it's afternoon. I'm Bridget Stesney, the chief for capital planning and development, as you know, as we talked about in your meeting. Right. We often do feasibility studies guided by our master plans that help us know where we need to increase our level of service. Right. So these feasibility studies often help us know what the community needs, and then those later turns into CIP projects. So, as you know, we'll do one coming up for the aquatic center we've been discussing. So that's the. That's the primary way. If you have other ones that you want us to look into, you can let us know, we can talk to our planning team about how we get those into the work program. And so that doesn't need to be notated here. We could just talk and see if the fund's allocated and then. Okay, perfect. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Council member Fisher, then, council member Hawkins. I'll just. Oh, can you hear me? I'm sorry. I just want to be really short and just think. Director Chyler, for your. For your leadership and working with me in the projects and things in my district, and of course, my former professor and district two, council member cherish bureau, for everything that you do. So I just want to thank you. I know it's a hard job, and there's a lot of demands, especially for my district with a lot of urban plan design. So I appreciate it and just want to thank you. Councilmember Hawkins. Mister chair, Mister Director, I wanted to say all my colleagues have spoken, and I just want you all to know. So I ride around the county.

Lastly, working with the schools. That was a challenging experience last year, trying to work with recreation and athletics and to watch Bill Sheehan in the school system and all of them and being able to call your deputies. You all have a great team. Thank you, sir. We appreciate that. And, yes, we do have a great team. As always, I'd like them to be acknowledged today, so I'm going to turn and acknowledge all of the professionals here that do a great job. And thank you for that comment. Okay. And I don't know if Councilman Durnoga or Franklin had comments. Sometimes I miss you up there. Well, I will thank you myself. Love my dog park across from Fairmont Heights High School. Looking forward to more. We've had a lot of positive feedback about amenities such as those, and, you know, just appreciate your responsiveness and your hard work, and I believe we can let you go.

Mister Hawkins is here, and Mister Olson will be here in a few moments. So we have a quorum and Missouriata has joined us. Thank you. So, moving on to the agenda, the first item is a briefing on the overview of the role of people zoning council and some data on cases from Mister Brown. Welcome, Mister Brown. Good morning. Good morning. So, turn it to you. I don't know if you wanted to have orientation by the auditor or not. No. Yes. I apologize. Miss Hightower. Yes. Good afternoon. Good morning. Chair and members of the committee, I can give a quick overview of the memorandum submitted by the Budget and Policy Analysis Division discussing Mister Brown's FY 2025 budget. And it's listed on page four of your virtual binder. The People Zoning Council is charged with protecting the public interest and promoting a full and fair presentation of relevant issues and administrative proceedings to achieve balanced records upon which sound land use decisions can be made. The People's zoning council appears at hearings on zoning matters and is empowered to summon and cross examine witnesses, introduce documentary evidence, file exemptions, exceptions, and present arguments at these hearings as the evidence of law may warrant. I'll tell you that the county's FY 2025 proposed. He's part of the FY 2025 proposed general fund budget, which includes 250,000, which is the same amount of funding as the FY 2024 approved budget. The funding supports one contract attorney. Expenses for the People zoning Council are covered under the Maryland National Capital park and Planning Commission as a project charge. The project charge is included in the administration fund in the planning department's budget. Thank you, chair. Thank you, Miss Hightower. Anything? I guess we don't need the audit report. Mister Brown. Yes, again. Good morning. I concur with the county executive budget recommendation of funding for this particular office. I would note that the funding has been static for at least the last probably seven to ten years. Has not increased nor decreased. In addition, it's probably important, since some of you may have questions about people's owning council, the office. There's been a lot of confusion, I think, over the last year and a half, over what the role of the people zoning council happens to be. And so maybe it's important that I sort of give a rendition of what the role is and where the authority comes from. The authority of People's owning council was created in 1970 in the Prince George's county charter. It's also authorized by the 2018 land Use article. And finally, it's authorized by the county zoning ordinance. Those three statutory sections set out the role of the role of people's zoning council and its duties. And I think people need to understand, particularly those who have been complaining for the last year or so, is that the role of people's zoning council is not to represent the people. The term People's zoning council is a misnomer. It does not reflect representing a party in a zoning case. People zoning council, the office is an office of neutrality and objectivity. It is my role to review the facts and the law objectively and give an opinion. The conflict comes in when one considers that this is a political process. The planning board may issue an opinion or a decision based upon the facts and the law, but sometimes they may also be persuaded by political motivations. And that's not bad. That's the process. That's the way it's set up. The applicant, in most cases, is always motivated by an economic motivation. And then the opposition, of course, are motivated by both politics and economics. And then finally, this county council or district council may be motivated by politics and or economics. My role as people's zoning council is to ignore the politics, to ignore the economics of whether it's good or bad for the county, to ignore whether or not a plebiscite of persons in the community are for or against a project. My role is to objectively look at the facts, look at the law, and give an objective, neutral assessment of whether I think a particular case should be approved or denied or. Or whether there's some ambiguity in the process. And so everyone plays a different role. So there will be occasions when the planning board will disagree with m", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Budget and Policy Analysis Division", "insights": [{"observation": "The People Zoning Council is charged with protecting the public interest and promoting a full and fair presentation of relevant issues and administrative proceedings to achieve balanced records upon which sound land use decisions can be made.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "County Executive Budget Recommendation", "insights": [{"observation": "Funding for the People Zoning Council has been static for at least the last seven to ten years.

My role is to objectively look at the facts, look at the law, and give an objective, neutral assessment of whether I think a particular case should be approved or denied or. Or whether there's some ambiguity in the process. And so everyone plays a different role. So there will be occasions when the planning board will disagree with me, and that's okay. There will be occasions when this council will disagree with me. That's okay. There will be many occasions when persons in the community and the developer and their attorneys will disagree with me. That is okay. That is the process. And so people in the community who have been new to this process over the last two years who come into the process and see that I object to material and refuse to let them testify in zoning, hearing examiner cases or before the county council. That's the reason why I do that. That is my role is to protect the record and to embellish the record with facts that, for whatever reason, have not been included before the planning board, have not been included before the examiner, and have not been included before the council. So that is going to happen on many occasions. And so that's the format I think that everybody needs to understand. First of all, and there have been some recommendations, I believe, over the last year and a half that this position should be altered. That's something that maybe you could consider, I think the county's owning ordinance, it was argued over the last six, seven years that we had not rewrote that ordinance for the last 50 years. Well, as I stated at the commencement of this presentation, people's own accounting council was created 54 years ago, 1970. It has been the same format for the last 54 years. So maybe it is time to relook at what the duties and responsibilities of people's own accounting council happens to be. However, I will note that although some persons have suggested that this should be a merit employee type of position, again, if it was a merit employee position, then you would not have the objectivity and the neutrality that currently the position requires. This is currently a contractual relationship, not an employee employer relationship, and that is why you have the objectivity and neutrality built into the position. There have been suggestions also that people's owning council as an office should have more outreach in the community, again, to explain the process. How it has worked up to this point is when the planning board or the examiner posts the required signage on a property for a case 30 days before hearing. Typically what occurs is someone in the community who sees that sign will call the planning board staff, call the zoning hearing examiner, and they will oftentimes refer those people to me. I will then have various conversations, telephone, in person, emails, communications with those people, explaining the process, trying to educate them on the process. But I cannot represent them as an attorney. The ordinance, the charter, the land use article forbid that. And so the recommendations from some that I should, or the office of people's only counsel should represent the community is really not feasible for the separate reason. An attorney client relationship is a consensual relationship. You cannot force, even though you may be paying the budget for the office of people's owner, counsel to be attorney or counsel for a particular community association, or for a particular person, he loses all objectivity and neutrality if he is forced to represent a particular party, I clearly would not take a position favorably toward a planning board decision which should be opined on favorably if I represent the opposition, so that cannot occur. Unfortunately, people in the community must have their own counsel. What are some of the other issues that have been raised that have been brought to my attention? Oh, yes. The number of cases that I review. Every year I gave a breakdown to the council of the planning board, zoning hearing examiner, and district council cases that I review. And again, this goes back to the issue of once a sign is posted, the inquiries come in. I review every subdivision case, staff report, every zoning case, every special exception case, every variance case that is filed in this county. I view them all. And the reason being is when park and planning puts up a subdivision case and people start to call, I cannot intellectually discuss that case if I haven't read it. So I read all of those staff reports because I know the calls are going to come in on every single one of them. Now, a particular case may not be controversial, but that doesn't mean there won't be ten or 15 calls once that sign goes up. So I read those staff reports. There's been a suggestion that I should only focus on cases that are controversial. In the last year, they've probably been, what, five, six, seven cases that are controversial. If that was all that I did, then all of those other calls would be ignored on the run of the mill cases. And those cases are important as well. So that's how I came up with the number of cases that I listed. District council cases, 117 zoning cases in fiscal year 2023, planning board cases, 421 cases. I know, Mister Dunoga, you did account as well. And there were planning board, not by fiscal year a", "esg_v1": [{"name": "NA", "insights": [{"observation": "There have been suggestions also that people's owning council as an office should have more outreach in the community, again, to explain the process.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "An attorney-client relationship is a consensual relationship.

If that was all that I did, then all of those other calls would be ignored on the run of the mill cases. And those cases are important as well. So that's how I came up with the number of cases that I listed. District council cases, 117 zoning cases in fiscal year 2023, planning board cases, 421 cases. I know, Mister Dunoga, you did account as well. And there were planning board, not by fiscal year as I calculated it, but by calendar year. They had a max of 361 cases. So the disparity of my 421 and 361 cases comes in where a case is either heard one, two, or three times, or it's continued for another occasion. So again, I read all of those reports. Whether it comes back twice to the planning board, whether it comes back twice to the district council, or whether a zoning hearing examiner case is heard on three or four different occasions, I read them all. And so that's where the discrepancy comes in. In terms of the volume of cases, there were questions about council bills and resolutions, which I also review. Again, it's impossible for me to understand all of the staff reports and cases. If I do not read the pending zoning bills and resolutions. The county council puts out a I think they put it out quarterly or semiannually. A list of all council bills and all resolutions I review to make sure that I have read all of the pending council bills and resolutions related to zoning. I do not read any resolutions or bills related to the budget, related to union contracts and things of that nature. But zoning bills, I do read them all. There was a question about whether I introduce evidence before the examiner or the planning board. Yes, I do introduce evidence before the examiner and the planning board, although it may not always appear on the record. Oftentimes when persons call me prior to a hearing, I will give them the information that they need to introduce the particular information. So oftentimes when a community organization is submitting evidence in the record, that's information that's come from me. I've told them, well, these are things that you need to look at. If they fail to do that, then yes, I will introduce information. There was a question about the meetings, emails, phone calls that I receive from the public. Again, it's not just from the public that I respond to correspondence. Oftentimes, zoning lawyers representing applicants, they will call me again and again and again on their case because they want to understand an ambiguity in the ordinance and what my position is going to be versus their position. And so that takes quite a bit of time. And often I will act as mediator between a zoning lawyer and their client and people in the community. And oftentimes that occurs before a case is even filed. And so when the zoning attorney is doing his pre filing information and he meets with community organizations, I will attend many of those organizational meetings, or I will unilaterally meet with people in the community and unilaterally meet with the developer. All of that takes a tremendous amount of time. There's a suggestion that's been made that to have additional outreach, maybe the Office of People's owning council should issue a newsletter or hold public forums. I'm not a journalist, so a newsletter probably wouldn't be helpful to anybody. But if that's something that folks want to look at, I'm willing to look at it. In terms of holding public forums. I think there are enough public forums that are conducted by the planning board and it's staff that clearly lay out what the various roles in the zoning process happens to be. I remember about 18 months ago, park and planning put out a PowerPoint that explained all of the roles of the various entities in the zoning process. And I have asked Mister Hunt to give a copy of that to the council because I think it was instructive on what my role is and what the other roles are. And I have used that when I've met with parking, planning staff and community organizations in the past. And oftentimes I will say those meetings occurred on Saturdays and Sundays, in the evenings. Just this past week, as a matter of fact, on Easter Sunday. I know Mister Dinogu is aware of it and Mister Olson as well. There was a problem at the what's called Jak buddhist temple in Hyattsville, where the temple had quite a few people at a single family home with loudspeakers and food. And I received and the email I sent to the council, 45 voicemails on Easter Sunday. 45. And the Lord knows how many emails that I received. And now, why did they call me? Because they don't know how to reach council members from time to time. That's usually the complaint that I hear. So they call me instead. They reached me too that day. Right. And so, you know, when folks say that, why does people's zoning council not have any outreach? People know how to find me, believe me. There's a suggestion here that maybe an alternative is to make the people's Zoning council position a full time in house position. Again, it is currently a contractual position, has been contractual since 1970. And the ordinance requires that the person who inhabits this particular role has a minimum of five years of zoning and land use experience and not be employed in what is typically considered a land use law firm. If it were a full time position, it's not a role that I would continue because I'm not interested in an", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Jak Buddhist Temple", "insights": [{"observation": "There was a problem at the Jak Buddhist temple in Hyattsville, where the temple had quite a few people at a single-family home with loudspeakers and food.

Mister Brown, I think you covered a lot. Okay, maybe we should. I just want to make sure I covered everyone's issues. So at the end of the day, as I indicated, I have an objection to the recommended budget for the office. If there is an appetite for changing the role of people's zoning council. Given that we've changed the zoning ordinance, which is 50 years old, and this position and its attributes are 50 years old as well, you know, that's something maybe the council could have a discussion about. All right. Thank you, Mister Brown. Very detailed response and briefing questions. Mister Hawkins. Mister Brown, thank you for your presentation. My question. You don't have to respond, but I'm sure with you saying your position has been in place for 54 years. Not you specifically, but the position. You may have some thoughts about some changes. If so, you may have already shared them without chair. If you do, I recommend that you share them with us so we can look at them if that's the case. Thank you Mister chair. Thank you Mister Hawkins. Mister Brown hasn't shared any particular changes with me. I think over the years we've talked about whether it's the best option to look at everything or to more focus attention on more critical cases. And I think we talked about this 15 years ago. This is not a new discussion. There's no proposal to change anything at the moment. I got some of those questions came from citizens who just this past week I had, I think Monday, somebody raising concerns. It's a typical concern because why does the people zoning council show up at a hearing and tell me I can't speak? And there's reasons for that. And you have to explain to folks what the role is. I think Mister Brown did a good job of discussing what his role is. It's to represent the public interest and like I said, be a neutral, objective person. I always point out that in Baltimore county that's the case. But it's also a more third party, kind of like the people's counsel for the Maryland Public Service commission that takes aside and defends what they consider to be the public interest. And generally in Baltimore county, they don't represent the development side, even if they think the development's right. They represent what would be the opposition side, but they don't represent the citizens. And that's one of the distinctions we've talked about over the years. But there's no suggestion that that should change at the present time. But the biggest question that comes up is one about people who are new to the county, new to the zoning process, not knowing that there is a people zoning council until they show up at a hearing and all of a sudden they don't have standing. Or they can't represent their community group because they didn't get the vote that occurred and that kind of stuff. So the question that has been posed is, can we do something to provide more education and outreach? I know Mister Brown does a lot, so there's no criticism. And part of my thinking is maybe we should have something that's put together by Mister Brown park and planning and the council that we send out regularly in our newsletters that go everywhere. Maybe people are to do that. I don't have anything that's canned that would be really good. So that might be something. But anyway, those types of questions have come from the public and it's because of lack of awareness. And in some regard, lack of awareness is all of our fault. But at the same time, there's only so much you can do to try to put out information. That's correct. And like I said, park and planning has a very good PowerPoint presentation that I will get to you. That really is, I think will be instructive on what the process is. Great. Appreciate that. Look, and I don't see Mister Franklin's hand up. Mister Olson, Miss Hightower, we don't need to take any action as a briefing, right? No, sir. Great. Well, thank you so much, Mister Brown. Truly appreciate it. Keep up the good work.

The Department of Parks and Recreation is responsible for acquiring land, developing and managing park and recreation facilities, maintaining and policing park property, and providing various leisure activities and services. The department carries out this work through three primary funds, park fund, recreation fund and enterprise fund, as well as smaller special revenue funds. Revenues to the two larger funds are primarily derived from property tax collections, representing 98% of the park fund revenue and 89% of the recreation fund revenue. The commission projects tax revenues in FY 25 to reach $307 million for these two funds, up $18 million from the current year. This projection assumes no change in real or personal property tax rates and is based on estimates from the estimates of the county's accessible base by the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation, published this past November. Revised estimates of the accessible base were released last week, and the commission will update its revenue projections if needed. Prior to budget adoption, enterprise fund revenue is split evenly between program generated funds such as fees, concessions, sales and rentals, and a transfer from the recreation fund. Across the three funds, non tax revenue has rebounded significantly from pandemic related lows by the end of fiscal year 23, the last fully completed fiscal year, charges for services reached $10 million after falling to $4 million. In fiscal year 21, rentals and concessions reached $6 million after falling to $1.8 million, and sales rebounded to $1.7 million after dropping to $980,000. Consequently, the FY 25 budget projects a continued upward trend in non tax revenue. Total revenue for the Parker recreation funds are projected at $324.7 million and $15.9 million for for the enterprise fund, the FY 25 budget proposes spending $353 million, excluding reserves in the park and recreation funds, an increase of 13%, or $42 million above the current fiscal year. The budget also proposes $16.6 million of spending in the enterprise fund. While we'll discuss the funds in greater detail, a summary of the proposed revenue and expenditures can be found on page six of your virtual binder. As you can see from that table, expected revenues in the park and recreation funds are not alone sufficient to support the proposed spending, necessitating the use of fund balance, $16.5 million in the park fund and $12 million in the recreation fund. We'll return to this use of fund balance a little bit more when discussing the recreation fund in details. Turning to staffing, the proposed FY 25 budget requests 1331 full and part time positions 71 more positions than the current fiscal year. This represents the single largest annual increase of positions in ten years. Notable additions include 13 child care positions, including three facility directors, two additional project managers within the capital planning and development division, five new park police officers and five park staff staffers for playgrounds, trails and field support. Pages six and seven of your binder have more details on the requested positions. The commission is currently in negotiations with its two collective bargaining units, and the budget includes $6.9 million for anticipated compensation adjustments. The department reported that recruiting, hiring and retaining staff are critical issues that we'll continue to face in the coming years. Through the first half of the fiscal year, December 31, the department reported 215 vacancies. A list of the vacant positions is included on page 65 of your virtual binder. More than half of these vacancies were unfilled for longer than six months, and 21% of those positions were unfilled for more than one year. Page seven of your virtual binder highlights the divisions with the highest number of overall vacancies as well as the longer term vacancies. The department has made strategic use of those unused personnel funds to address other priorities. For example, in FY 23, the department repurposed $8 million to replace outdated vehicles and heavy equipment to better meet the needs of its current work programs. Ultimately, the funds that are not repurposed are placing the fund balance to be carried forward to the subsequent fiscal year. Through December 31, the department reported filling 104 vacant positions. More than two thirds of those were longer term vacancies. Progress in filling those long term vacancies was highest in facility services as well as the northern and southern region parks and recreations. A listing of the field positions can be found on page 73 of your virtual binder. The department may provide updated hiring figures during its presentation. Turning to project charges project charges are budgeted at $4.9 million, a $4.4 million decrease from the current year, which you may recall included one time funding for twelve projects. A history of the budget versus actual project charges can be found on page eight of your virtual binder. For the Largo headquarters building.

Turning to project charges project charges are budgeted at $4.9 million, a $4.4 million decrease from the current year, which you may recall included one time funding for twelve projects. A history of the budget versus actual project charges can be found on page eight of your virtual binder. For the Largo headquarters building. The FY 25 budget includes $5.9 million in charges to the commissioner's office, planning department and Department of Parks and Recreation for operating and maintenance expenses for the Largo headquarters. In fiscal year 2023, the commission transferred 55 of the $85 million appropriated to the Headquarters Internal Service Fund to complete the sale and renovations for initial occupancy. As part of the FY 25 budget, the commission requests authority to transfer $40 million from fund balance in the administration fund for repairs and renovations not covered by the FY 23 request. A description of the renovations can be found on pages 28 and 29 of your of your virtual binder. So turning to the individual funds in greater detail, the park fund provides funding to support park maintenance, development and security operations, as well as funding to manage natural resources and provide recreational opportunities within a park setting. The park fund property tax is applied to the metropolitan district, which includes all areas of the county except the municipalities of district Heights, Greenbelt and Laurel, along with the areas of Cuasco, Nottingham and parts of West Laurel. The commission proposes a personal property tax rate of $39.85 and a real property tax rate of $15.94. The commission anticipates property tax revenues of $202 million, up $12 million from the current fiscal year. Nontax revenue is projected at $3.7 million, driven by a strong rebound in rentals and concessions activity. As noted on page five of the report, interest income can vary wildly from year to year, going as low as $36,000 in FY 21 and as high as $4.9 million in FY 23, and therefore the budget prudently relies on minimal cost collections. The park fund budget proposes $222 million in expenditures excluding reserves, an increase of $27.6 million above the current adopted budget. In addition to the 41 requested positions, the budget doubles the department's investment in capital outlays from three point five to seven point seven million dollars to address repairs and replenishment of vehicle, fleet, environmental and IT systems, sets aside $7.6 million for post employment benefits and increases other services and charges by $13 million, the bulk of which are invested in facilities support and it services. The commission proposes transferring $16.9 million to the debt service fund, 2.6 million more than the current year, as well as $19.3 million to the capital projects fund, $7.1 million less than the current year. Operating reserves are budgeted at $9.3 million, with the fy 25 expenditures exceeding expected revenues. The budget proposes using $18 million in fund balance, resulting in an undesignated fund balance of $50.9 million at the end of FY 25. Turning to the recreation fund the recreation fund provides funding to support various educational, recreational and leisure activities. The property tax for the recreation fund is applied to the entire county. The commission proposes a personal property tax rate of $19.50 and a real property tax rate of $7.80, which is projected to generate $105.6 million in FY 25, an increase of $6.3 million over the current year. Nontax revenue makes up a greater percentage of the revenue in the recreation fund as opposed to the park fund. Nontax revenue is projected at $13.4 million, including $11 million in user fees and service charges. As noted on page ten of your binder, the FY 25 projection is particularly aggressive, more than $3.5 million, or 50% higher than that collected any year since 2015, including FY 23, when the Prince George's county sports and Learning complex was moved to the recreation fund. The department plans to meet this revenue goal by increasing memberships and visits to community centers, expanding youth sports programming, opening the southern area aquatics, recreation and wellness centers and increasing fees for child care, aquatics, camps and classes. The commission's detailed response can be found on page 40 of your virtual binder. The recreation fund budget proposes expenditures of $131 million, excluding reserves, an increase of $14.8 million over the current fiscal year. In addition to the 28 new positions, the increase is highlighted by set asides for compensation adjustments, post employment benefits and a $3 million increase to the capital Projects Fund. The budget also includes an $8 million transfer to subsidize enterprise fund operations and sets aside $5.9 million for operating reserves. A summary of the recreation fund revenues and expenditures can be found on page eleven of your binder. With FY 25 expenditures exceeding expected revenues, the budget proposes using $12.6 million in fund balance, resulting in an undesignated balance of $37.5 million at the end of FY 25. It is important to note that in the case of the park and recreation funds, fund balance is being used to cover the growing cost of ongoing operations rather than one time expenses. Looking back at recent fiscal years, fund balance has been put towards large one time expenditures such as the Largo headquarters transfers, the $35 million set aside for the athletic facilities partnerships, or the si", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Department of Parks and Recreation", "insights": [{"observation": "Progress in filling those long term vacancies was highest in facility services as well as the northern and southern region parks and recreations.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The park fund provides funding to support park maintenance, development, and security operations, as well as funding to manage natural resources and provide recreational opportunities within a park setting.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "In addition to the 41 requested positions, the budget doubles the department's investment in capital outlays from $3.5 million to $7.7 million to address repairs and replenishment of vehicle, fleet, environmental and IT systems.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The department plans to meet this revenue goal by increasing memberships and visits to community centers, expanding youth sports programming, opening the southern area aquatics, recreation, and wellness centers, and increasing fees for childcare, aquatics, camps, and classes.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Commissioner's Office", "insights": [{"observation": "In fiscal year 2023, the commission transferred $55 million of the $85 million appropriated to the Headquarters Internal Service Fund to complete the sale and renovations for initial occupancy.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "As part of the FY 25 budget, the commission requests authority to transfer $40 million from fund balance in the administration fund for repairs and renovations not covered by the FY 23 request.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"observation": "The budget proposes using $18 million in fund balance, resulting in an undesignated fund balance of $50.9 million at the end of FY 25.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "neutral"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Department of Parks and Recreation", "insights": [{"observation": "Progress in filling those long term vacancies was highest in facility services as well as the northern and southern region parks and recreations.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The park fund provides funding to support park maintenance, development, and security operations, as well as funding to manage natural resources and provide recreational opportunities within a park setting.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "In addition to the 41 requested positions, the budget doubles the department's investment in capital outlays from $3.5 million to $7.7 million to address repairs and replenishment of vehicle, fleet, environmental and IT systems.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The department plans to meet this revenue goal by increasing memberships and visits to community centers, expanding youth sports programming, opening the southern area aquatics, recreation, and wellness centers, and increasing fees for childcare, aquatics, camps, and classes.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Commissioner's Office", "insights": [{"observation": "In fiscal year 2023, the commission transferred $55 million of the $85 million appropriated to the Headquarters Internal Service Fund to complete the sale and renovations for initial occupancy.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "As part of the FY 25 budget, the commission requests authority to transfer $40 million from fund balance in the administration fund for repairs and renovations not covered by the FY 23 request.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"observation": "The budget proposes using $18 million in fund balance, resulting in an undesignated fund balance of $50.9 million at the end of FY 25.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "neutral"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1965494, "chunk_end_time": 2401630, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3455?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3455?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=1965"}, {"start": 29000, "end": 35000, "text": "e 28 new positions, the increase is highlighted by set asides for compensation adjustments, post employment benefits and a $3 million increase to the capital Projects Fund.

A summary of the recreation fund revenues and expenditures can be found on page eleven of your binder. With FY 25 expenditures exceeding expected revenues, the budget proposes using $12.6 million in fund balance, resulting in an undesignated balance of $37.5 million at the end of FY 25. It is important to note that in the case of the park and recreation funds, fund balance is being used to cover the growing cost of ongoing operations rather than one time expenses. Looking back at recent fiscal years, fund balance has been put towards large one time expenditures such as the Largo headquarters transfers, the $35 million set aside for the athletic facilities partnerships, or the single year $20 million increases to increases in the transfer to the capital projects funds in fiscal years 2021. In contrast, this proposed budget uses fund balance to meet an operating deficit, driven at least partly by increases requested in this budget that set the baseline for subsequent years. The current available fund balance is largely a product of higher than projected interest income in single occurrences, such as the smaller Largo headquarters transfer and the athletic facilities Partnership set aside, which hasn't been repurposed. As the ongoing imbalance is resolved by temporary and unpredictable funds, the need for revenue enhancements becomes more likely. Turning to the enterprise fund the enterprise Fund aims to operate facilities that serve specialized recreational needs of the county's residents without unnecessarily taxing those who do not utilize the services. These facilities include the Showplace arena and Equestrian center, the Bladensburg Waterfront Park, College Park Airport, golf courses, ice rinks and tennis bubbles. Although the commission intends to recover the cost of operating these facilities primarily through user charges, merchandise sales and concessions, the transfer from the recreation fund remains about half of the fund's revenues. A table of the subsidies by facility can be found on page eleven of your virtual binder. Total revenues in the enterprise fund are projected at $15.9 million and and proposed expenditures are $16.6 million, including the addition of two new golf course positions. The FY 25 budget reduces the golf course subsidy as user fee collections have grown. The Advanced Land Acquisition Fund was established to acquire land needed for specific public uses and purposes, including state highways, roads and schools sites. The fund uses property tax collections to pay for the principal and interest of land acquisition bonds. As all outstanding bonds have been paid off. The commission does not anticipate generating any property tax revenue from this fund. A further description of the fund can be found on page twelve of your binder. The proposed six year capital improvement program is approximately $373.4 million, a 6% decrease from the FY 24 to 29 CIP. The proposed capital budget for FY 25 is $131.2 million, a 3% decrease from the FY 24 adopted budget. This decrease is due to state grants not yet included in the budget. While the CIP will be further discussed during the meeting of the committee of the whole, a breakout of the revenues and and expenses for the capital project fund is included on page 21 of your binder. This concludes my overview of the budget. Thank you. Any pressing questions or should we wait till after we hear from park and planning? Mister Shapiro, welcome. Good morning Mister chair.

Next slide, please. Last year we informed you of the department's FY 24 focus areas, ADA compliance, expanded community engagement, park revitalization, increased partnerships, staff retention, and improved customer care. The video that we will show you in a moment, along with some FY 24 highlights that will come a little bit later in the presentation will give you a snapshot of programs and services delivered over the past year. So let's please take a moment to see the great programs and services provided by the department. Please start the video. Give us a second. I'm doing this. I don't have the skill set to turn on the video. The Maryland National Capital park and Planning Commission Department of Parks and Recreation Princess George's county is deeply rooted in our growing community. We're a Capra accredited agency providing quality and innovative parks and recreation services for all. For almost 100 years, we've evolved alongside our community. We serve with heart. One of the best things I think about parking planning. There is great attention to the participant. There are great ideas about expanding his social base. So so far, for these 30 years, it has been amazing. So hats off to parking planet. We serve a diverse community, including residents of all ages, ability levels, cultural, religious, racial and ethnic backgrounds, across urban, suburban and rural areas with a wide range of programs. Let us show you what serving with heart looks like. Serving with heart looks like equity. We strive for a future where everyone has fair access to quality parks and recreation. We create parks for everyone and offer more than $390,000 a year in bacon programs and scholarships. We have community pools, but families might not feel comfortable going to them, you know, especially if their children don't know how to swim. So this kind of opens up the avenue that, hey, you have resources in your community. You know that they're available to you. You're more likely to utilize them. Serving with the heart looks like prioritizing health and wellness, fitness in the parks, mental health and active senior programs, and many more all help to improve the health of our residents. To address food insecurity, we partner with local organizations to train future farmers, provide prepared meals, promote urban agriculture opportunities, and donate venison and vegetable grown in our own community gardens to local food banks. Serving with heart looks like conservation Jug Bay, Maryland's largest wild rice marsh, is a crucial food source for sea eating birds. Like sora rails, they depend on it during their fall migration. Soras face extinction without these habitats. Over the past 18 years, we've restored the wild rice marshes and monitor the birds migration patterns, using them as indicators of environmental quality. At MNC PPC, we excel at protecting and stewarding the land, air and water through our sustainability practices, and we take care of our cultural and historic properties important to our community. As you can see, we have world class facilities and quality recreation programs. MNCPPC Department of Parks and Recreation is dedicated to growing with our community and meeting their needs. We will focus our next chapter of growth on trails, culture and arts, athletic field management and upgrades, environmental stewardship, Americans with Disabilities act and branding and customer care. Our employees and volunteers strive to create exceptional places for people and animals to gather, enjoy the outdoors, experience healthy recreational activities, and to have fun. We invite you to change, move and grow with MNC, PPC Department of Parks and Recreation Prince George's county live more, play more thank you. I would like to now say thank you to the talented staff to put that video together, Miss Anika Jackson and her team from pace and the thousands of employees that make all of those activities that you've just seen happen on a daily basis. Another round of applause if we don't mind. Next slide please. Building on the department's mission, we have seven ongoing pillars that help set the long term vision for our work. These are incorporated in the adopted Formula 2040 Functional Master plan, the Land Preservation Parks and recreation plan, and the comprehensive recreation plan. These documents can be provided for you at your request. I will now turn the presentation over to our budget manager, Miss Donahuer. Thank you. Next slide the slide before you provides examples of the great things our department has consistently for the residents of Prince George's county. Committed to building community relationships, the department increased its volunteerism programs and social media engagement.

Building on the department's mission, we have seven ongoing pillars that help set the long term vision for our work. These are incorporated in the adopted Formula 2040 Functional Master plan, the Land Preservation Parks and recreation plan, and the comprehensive recreation plan. These documents can be provided for you at your request. I will now turn the presentation over to our budget manager, Miss Donahuer. Thank you. Next slide the slide before you provides examples of the great things our department has consistently for the residents of Prince George's county. Committed to building community relationships, the department increased its volunteerism programs and social media engagement. The department continues to work alongside our community members, recording nearly 14,000 volunteer hours. This time invested equates to $473,000. Additionally, the department provided over 155 teen volunteer opportunities which engaged over 1400 teens. The departments social media outreach has increased its followers by 36% with over 260,000 impressions this past fiscal year. This indicates how engaged the community is with the departments brand. Specifically, the departments Instagram page has increased its views by 177%. This is largely due to the increased use of video reels. This demonstrates the interest of followers and videos of our programs and services. Next slide we have seen an increase in visits and program enrollment over the past year. Our recreation centers remain a hub for the community with over 1 million visits in fiscal year 2024. The youth and county wide sports division continues to be busy increasing and diversifying program offerings and a new ARP position focused on teams directly correlates to the increase in team participation. We continue to expand our natural surface trail offerings and now are at over 51 miles of trails and the new wayfinding system helps to improve the users experience on the trails. Our park operations teams are increasing the inspections, renovations and upkeep of our playgrounds and in FY 24, using the inspection data, we renovated over more than 60 playgrounds. Next slide we are very proud of our park police team and they continue to set a high bar for our community policing efforts with attendance at 162 community events. While one crime is a crime too many, we continue to have historically low crime in our parks. We would like to remind you that these are fiscal year 2024 highlights and over the next two months we will continue making progress. Next slide this slide is a summary of the department's park and recreation funds. You will note that there is a 17.6% increase in the overall operations. The transfer to the CIP pay Go is posed to decrease by 11.4% while debt service will increase by 18.6%. The increase in operations is due largely to our focus areas which are natural and paved surfaces, our partnership with Prince George County Public Schools, inclusion services through our therapeutic recreation programs, arts and culture, environmental stewardship, meeting ADA standards and overall compliance. The 17.6% increase reflects a one time budget expenditure of 6.1 million. These items, which are critical, needs upgrades in firearms and communications equipment for our park police, county wide ev charging stations and information technology infrastructure upgrades, as well as significant vehicle repairs and replacements. Currently, of our 83 vehicles that need to be either replaced or receive a major repair, we can only address seven to eight with our current budget. This does not include those vehicles well past their useful life due to day to day wear and tear. This slide provides an overview of the proposed budgets for the enterprise and special revenue funds. Our ongoing goal for the enterprise fund is to gradually reduce the need to subsidize this fund. We increased revenue goes to pre Covid levels and provided increased offerings. One area that continues to be popular is golf and our expectation is that these operations will continue to thrive. Given this, we have projected an increase in the overall revenue goals based on increased offerings. As with the enterprise fund, the revenue goals for the special revenue fund were also increased to pre Covid levels and expenditures increased proportionately to accommodate the increased programming. Please note an overall adjustment was included in all funds containing seasonal workers to reflect the appropriate minimum wage increase per the state of Maryland in January 2022. This will assist in providing the correct amount of funding for seasonal staffing needs. The adjustment is more prominent in the special revenue fund because the programming related to this fund is primarily staffed by our seasonal workers. I'll now turn the presentation over to Director Tyler. Thank you Miss Heron. Our FY 25 proposed budget builds on success of the pass and continues to improve what we currently have and positions the department for future success. The FY 25 proposed budget is responsive to the feedback from the community during the budget development process. In person engagement, council guidance and surveys. In addition to our primary focus on trails, athletic fields, culture and arts, environmental stewardship and compliance, we have added branding and customer care to our FY 25 budget focus. As shown in the video, serving with heart means providing residents and visitors quality programs and services. Next slide. What you have seen is a department that serves with heart. We have over 1200 career employees, approximately 5000 contract employees, part time team members. We look forward to presenting our CIP budget on April 30 and are prepared to answer any questions you may have regarding our FY 25 proposed operating budget.

Thank you Mister Shapiro, Mister Tyler, I'll turn to council members for questions. Mister Olson, I see. Mister Franklin, we'll get to you next. Thank you Mister chair. Is this working? Can you hear me? Okay, thank you. Thank you for the presentation and I always appreciate the efforts of park and planning and serving our community. I know you do an awful lot for our residents. A couple questions. Can you talk about staffing? I mean, I know you talked about 1200 employees, but how is it going with filling empty positions? How long is it taking to get positions filled? Are there any areas that are more challenging than other areas? Can you just talk a little bit about that? Yes, certainly. We have been challenged over the last three years with filling some positions because of the competition that is out there. As a result of COVID we are now beginning to increase our rate of filling vacancies. We've done a really, really good job of doing that over the past, excuse me, over the past twelve months. And we expect to continue to do an even better job over the the next twelve months. But it has been a bit of a challenge. But we see ourselves coming out on the other side. Okay, so in terms of like how long it takes to fill vacancies and whatnot? Well, good question. Prior to just as I got here, it was taking us about 150 days to get someone from the recruitment process into the department. We've reduced it now in some cases to 60 days, but the average is right around 75 to 80 days. 75 to 80 days. Okay, well that's certainly an improvement. I assume you're working on making it even quicker? Yes. And I assume you've been working with employee Prince George's and on getting people into the workforce. Yes, we have. As a matter of fact, we had a meeting with Chair Shapiro and employ Prince George's to talk about that very thing, to really reach out to the communities that may not be on the radar, as we would say, to get into some of the positions that we have available. So we're working with them and some other organizations to make sure that we reach residents that may not have been on the radar before. Okay. And I assume we're also trying to reach people who are reentry into the workforce. Yes, that is correct. Okay, great. Great. Okay. Thank you, mister chair. I know this is the operating budget, so I guess in terms of specific programs we will hold on questions about that. Is that correct? Or. I know there was an overview of trails and, and whatnot, but I guess that's probably for another day. Is that correct? Maybe the CIP budget. That's what I'm thinking. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I guess I would just say, I know we have a lot of ambitious programs. I know we're trying to. Mister Olson, maybe have you had a meeting with Mister Tyler about the CIP? We are. Well, we are. Yes, we have. And we have another meeting coming up. Yes, I think that might be where you want to bring the question up. No, that's, that's fair. That's fair. That's fine. Thank you. Didn't you have an invasive species question? Yes, I did. Well, my question was about our parks and invasives in our parks and what kind of, what kind of a program we have to really tackle those. I mean, especially as our urban forests are, you know, more important than ever. You know, we are losing some forests. So the forests that we have in our urban areas, not just our urban areas, but I guess all across the county are important. And I know I've talked with you about that, some specifically to my district. What are we doing in terms of invasives, the iv that's strangling trees, all of that. I'm going to ask Deputy Director Carter to come up or designate someone to answer that question for you. Okay, thank you. Good morning. Steve Carter, deputy director for parks and facility management, council member Olson. We have a pesticide free program that we started two years ago. We have 132 parks where we do not use pesticides, but we also have cleanups with community members where we go around to different parks, trails, playgrounds, to reduce some of those invasives as you speak about. So I think our team are doing a fantastic job. But we also ask the community if you see areas that need further cleanup that our staff will be ready for that. Yeah. Thank you. So I hope that we can have like a, I don't know if we have any kind of a matrix of, you know, all of our holdings across the county and what the condition is, what that forest health is or that kind of thing. I don't know. Do we have that? I think we can get back to you on that. Okay. Because that might be helpful to target elimination of invasives. I do think that we need to keep working on that because the more trees we lose, you know, it takes 50 years for them to get back to the levels where they are, so. Absolutely. Thank you very much.

Thank you. I'll turn to Mister Franklin and then Miss Uriatta. Thank you Mister chair. I want to thank Mister Tyler, Mister Shapiro and your team for the presentation of the work that the parks and recreation department does for our residents. I wanted to ask, and this is something that you managed out of recreation activity programs for the county year, proposing a budget, but I have not seen it and have requested a copy of it. Where can I find the recreation schedule of. I will get you that copy. We do have that document and I will send that to you at the conclusion of this meeting today. Okay, thank you. And then when I get out, I'll circulate my colleagues. They'll probably want to look at it and have some questions when you come for us again. Thank you. Absolutely. Thank you. Other questions, councilmember? I'm sorry. Sure. Mister Taylor. I know your team spoke about and responded to council member Olson's question on the invasive species. Removing invasive vines and plants, undermining the health of the rural urban woodlands are critically important for public health and environmental systems. Important to protect against flooding and climate change. This is an important and easy lift to eliminate. Even though you spoke on it, mister chair. Council chair ivey had sent me a text, you spoke on it. So I just want to add that part to it. Not necessarily for a response, but to share what council chair ivey concerned was. Thank you sir. Thank you for your presentation and being here today. I just had a few questions, so one thing and let me turn to the page in my budget book just so I can have clarity as I'm reading this, there's a section that talked about how you have like park operations and it has like north county region and south region. And then it has for each year actuals estimated for 2025. And it has it listed at 350 for the northern and 160 for the southern. But I can't really tell what that number is. Is that the number of programs? I just wasn't clear on what that number was between the two. If I could find a page page 278 under goals and performance measures. So I was just trying to understand under the park operations, and it, like for FY 22, has 101 for the north Region Parks division and then 32. And it talks about in this section how there's equipment and materials provided in support for community events. These include events sponsored, co sponsored by the parking planning, local municipalities, recreation councils, boys and girls clubs, community associations, etcetera. So I just want to make sure I'm understanding that that's just the total amount of events for the northern region versus the southern region. If you don't mind, I'd like to do a little research on that and get back to you, if that would be okay. Sure. Thank you. And I can send it in an email, too. That would be perfect. Thank you. Uh huh. And then another thing, when you looked at the goal section and the budget for, excuse me, budget goals for 2025, it talked about fee increases for like, daily admissions. And then when you looked in the highlights for FY 24, it also talked about fee increases as being, like, accomplishments. So I'm just trying to understand, is it that you did some fee increases and you're trying to do more or we're increasing it even more? And does that make sense with the region? Because one of the things I hear when I talk to community members is just the cost of doing things here versus in, like, DC, when a lot of things are free. So just wanting to understand that what the fee increases are going to look like. Well, let me say we plan catch up. We haven't been raising fees in many of our programs for many years, and so we've started to increase those fees slightly. Not a tremendous increase, but just enough to really make sure that we're able to pay for the programs and those folks that are delivering those programs. We can also get back to you on that if you'd like. But I also have Miss Ramos here from our recreation division, if she would like to come up and maybe explain a little bit about some fee increases, that'd be great. Good morning. Wanda Ramos, deputy director for recreational leisure services. And some of the fee increases have been primarily in classes, you know, specific to, you know, some of the races that we have to pay more to an, for an instructor. So it has to match what the classes are. Some of the fee increases have been at the golf courses with many enhancements that we have made enterprise golf course and all through the courses that we have, if you come and visit, you know, so that matches a little bit, you know, and they have been very minor changes to that kids care program, after school programs that are supposed to be self sustaining in a way. So we have made some increases, and as director Tyler mentioned, it has been kind of a catch up. Normally we do an increase and we don't increase it again for another two years or three years. So it's. It's pretty much a catch up. And it hasn't been across the board on memberships yet. We just do a study, we kind of do an assessment, and then we do a cost recovery with that.

So it has to match what the classes are. Some of the fee increases have been at the golf courses with many enhancements that we have made enterprise golf course and all through the courses that we have, if you come and visit, you know, so that matches a little bit, you know, and they have been very minor changes to that kids care program, after school programs that are supposed to be self sustaining in a way. So we have made some increases, and as director Tyler mentioned, it has been kind of a catch up. Normally we do an increase and we don't increase it again for another two years or three years. So it's. It's pretty much a catch up. And it hasn't been across the board on memberships yet. We just do a study, we kind of do an assessment, and then we do a cost recovery with that. And we have been trying to catch up a little bit on those fee increases. Thank you. That's helpful. And if you could send like, the. Just the increases for 2024 and then like, projector for 2025, I think that would be helpful to see what that looks like. And to your point, like, what are the things that are going to be increased and what are the things that are not going to be increased? And then I also saw a section where it talked about increasing with senior field trips, especially like, getting that back up and running. I know that during COVID we stopped that. I was just curious about, because it did talk about how they're usually sold out. Do we also have free trips or are all of, like, the senior trips in those programs have costs associated with it? I'll turn to deputy director. You might just stay up and I'll show you. Yes. Okay. I will stay here for senior centers. Yes, we're trying to get back. We used to have a very robust trips and excursions program that had to be self sustaining. Pay for the big bus and everything else. But with the seniors, we try to keep it very low, moderate, often free. But it's normally sometimes $10, $12. It depends on where they want to go and if there's admission fee. Right. We have to pay a driver to take them with them. So there have been very minor, actually, I haven't heard that. We have increased tremendously for this. Seniors mainly are. If we need to get a coach bus, right, that's where they increase. And we haven't been able to bring those back. Hopefully in the near future we do the longer away field trips that we used to do with the seniors. Got it. And just. I'd be interested in figuring out or working with you to see what the senior program looks like at each different location. Because I've sponsored a few buses to the Temple Hills location. Cause they've had really good, like, senior programs, but I've, you know, sponsored buses for my district into Ed's district for those events. And so I wasn't sure. If we weren't just having the same programs in my district or why was it they kept reaching out to ask me to charter buses to take my seniors from my district into those events? So that's just something we could talk offline to figure out. We can. We have a scheduled program meeting with you in your office, but it's only 30 minutes, so we might need more time to bring all this information. Okay, I will make sure that we increase that. And then my last question, because I want to make sure there's space for other people, is, you know, I then went through the section of the budget that kind of just breaks down each division and kind of has, like, the personnel versus, like, supplies and materials, etcetera. So just want to understand here, because I know personal tends to be like, a big portion of the budget, but when we talk about. So on page 337, for example, it talks about the supplies, materials for the north region, southern region, and let's look at the arts and cultural heritage section. To me, I would think pretty low, but maybe these are like, supplies when you're talking about like paper, like office material supplies, not program supplies, because I'm just looking at the difference between the ratio we're spending on personnel and what it looks like around materials. And so I'm just wanting to make sure we're spending enough on our program work. But maybe that's not what this is. And so, no, I will have to probably look and defer to division chief of arts and cultural heritage. Yes. To answer, because I see you guys have 353,000 change. I love you guys to have more, but maybe this isn't, you know, that I'm looking at, and I wish I had the numbers in front of me, but I can tell you that during our Covid years, we did not spend the money that we earned from the, or were granted from the Maryland State Arts Council. And coming out of COVID we got an additional. I'm not going to give you a number, but several hundred thousand dollars again, that's been supplementing our programs, supplies, materials. So we've been good there. Okay. Am I fair to think, like, that's the line item that you're using for, like, programmatic materials for some, yes. Okay. So I would find it there. So. Cause I see all of, like, the programs you're doing. And so trying to get a ratio of, like, what we're spending on the programs. That's the fair line item to be looking at, actually. Let me know offline one more time. Okay. If you don't know, because I'm trying to, because I see all the programs, but I'm not really sure how much we're spending on them because sometimes we have amazing programs, but I think they're underfunded. We can be spending more money on those different programs to help ramp up the capacity, but it's harder for me to, like, see what we're actually spending per program. And I just wasn't sure if that's the right place. I should be, be looking. I can get those numbers for you. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Last. Last thing. You know, I will say this as I dive in.

I know we're going to have a meeting, and I thank you guys for that. And we're going to do a tour, so I'm excited about that as well. I really am committed to making sure that from a programmatic standpoint, that we really have the resources that we need to see with our community. That is like my number one priority. I think that our recreation department, the staff at all these facilities are doing amazing work, but maybe under resourced in a way. And so I know we have a thought of, you know, $40 million more in a building, and that will be a discussion, as the council has. But for me, I love to see that money spent in a programmatic way, or at least if we spend that money, I never want to hear, no, we can't afford something in our community. And I want to talk about the project charges. We can talk about that offline. I see that the actuals are going to be very low because I know we didn't roll out a majority of the project charges. So I think we can have the conversation of possibly rolling some of those over into the next fiscal year just to make sure that we see those programs come to fruition. Because we have some great organizations that are doing work like guns down Friday when we talk about what we're seeing in our community with violence. And we have an opportunity to partner and get these organizations the resources they need. I think we just have to do that, and we're not doing our job as council members if we don't. So thank you. And councilmember Ariata would just like to say that we're in alignment with you in terms of the programming and making sure that there's enough funding for the program in each community. So we're in alignment on that. Thank you, Missouriata. Mister Burrows, welcome. Thank you, mister chair. Is my mic on? It is okay. Thank you, mister chair. It's no surprise I have grave concerns with parking, planning and the way that you're spending your resources, particularly around this very expensive headquarters. I remember before the new council was sworn in, Mister Shapiro, you asked me, councilmember Oreada, council member bligue, to come tour the new headquarters and you access to vote for it. And in those conversations, we asked you to be supportive of things that would help black and brown youth in the inner beltway and in parts of my district and in parts of council Moriata's district. Not one thing that was agreed to during that visit has come to fruition to help our youth. And yet you're back again today, in part requesting an additional $40 million for your headquarters. When I have poor black children on the side of the road selling water bottles for helmets and shoulder pads, it is a disgrace in this county when we give so much money to parks and rec that we have poor black kids on the side of the road selling water to meet their basic needs for recreation. It is absolute disgrace. And this is something that the entire public should know. And I will be working to inform the public over the next few months as we get ready for the budget. Make no mistake about it, I value the work that the folks are doing at the community centers. I was at community center, several community centers this weekend. I went to a princess party at Tucker Road. I did the event at South Tech Rec center. So I love the people who are in the actual community centers doing the work. I got my bluebell in a community center. One of my very best friends play basketball at the community center. And I do. I have heard that there are improvements, especially with the financial team. I know there are a lot of new energy. And, don, I believe that's your team. I'm hearing positive things that are now happening, but from a leadership standpoint, the priorities are out of whack. And Mister Tyler, you said to council member Oriata, we're in alignment there. You're not truly in alignment until I see the resources trickle down to the programs that she's talking about. Because when I'm in these communities, when I'm knocking doors in the high density poverty neighborhoods in my district, you're not there. The kids are not doing anything. And so we get a lot of lip service from parking, planning, leadership, in my experience, but I don't see it trickle down to actually serving the young people. And this is why I feel so bad. And Miss Skinner, Miss Oselbrooks had the proposal to take over the rec department that I fought. And I was wrong on that. I was wrong on that because Parkin Planet is operating as a separate entity, unaccountable. And at the end of the day, when we look at the rise in juvenile crime, recreation, and let me be clear, this money is not your money. These are tax dollars. And our residents are not getting their return on investment from these tax dollars as they should. And as we look at the rise in juvenile crime, we need more quality activities with community based groups, and park and planet has failed to do that, in my opinion.

But there are a lot of boys and girls clubs and mentoring groups and people who are in the trenches, who are in the neighborhoods that I see, because I'm there and I don't see any of you there. And I think it's disgraceful that a lot of those commitments that were made at this brand new headquarters building where myself was there, Councilmember Oriato was there, Councilman Bligue was there when you were begging us to vote for this headquarters. None of those things have come to fruition, and I'm truly disappointed in it. And I hope park and planning, I know a lot of your team is here. Quality recreational and youth programming is one of the major solutions to juvenile crime. And if we're not doing everything that we can to support the organizations that are on the ground doing the work, we're falling short of what we're capable of. And I've seen more advocacy from the leadership of park and planning regarding this headquarters than I have seen regarding youth programming. And that is a shame. And I'll stop there. Thank you, councilmember. Mister chair, if I may, please, let me just say, first of all, councilmember, I appreciate your sentiment on this, and there are some things that we're just going to be disagreeing about. I hear you loud and clear. I would say that our team here, I could not be more proud of the team for all of the work that they do for the residents of this county. And you have highlighted some of the work yourself that you see in the county. I think that this Department of Parks and Recreation stands up to any department of Parks and Recreation in the country for their commitment to helping the most neediest of residents in the county, an amazing amount of work that they do. And the other thing that I would respectfully disagree about is the idea that I have not, and Director Tyler and others have not been advocating for those most at need in the county. I think there's plenty of evidence that that is mostly what we do. Yes, it is true that there is a headquarters building that we've been advocating for. Respectfully, councilmember, it is completely inaccurate that we are pushing harder for that than all the other hundreds and hundreds of programs that affect tens of thousands of kids throughout this county. So, respectfully, I disagree with the basic premise of what you're saying, and I would hold this team up to any team in the country for all the incredible work that's been done. And councilmember, this may not be the forum for the, for a longer conversation about that unless you choose it to be. But I'm happy to talk with with you, and our team is happy to talk with you and about all the priorities that we have and all the wonderful programs that we have. And I really appreciate your time. And Mister chair, I appreciate you allowing me the time to spend a few minutes in response to council member Burroughs. Thank you. Mister Shapiro. Just out of curiosity, the thought of children doing various things to raise money, what is park and planning doing to help boys and girls clubs in terms of facilities and equipment and that type of thing? I mean, we could spend probably an hour talking about that. I'll turn it over to Director Tyler. I could say we're in short, we're the major funder of the boys and girls clubs in the county. But let me turn that over to Director Tyler, who can speak in more detail about that. First of all, I'd like to echo the sentiments of cheerleaders Shapiro and we do. And I would love to have a conversation with you, sir, council member Burroughs, to really talk about some of the gaps that you see and some of the gaps that we are trying to fill so that we can come to a really common solution on how to fix that. So I think that is a conversation that we can and should have, and I would welcome that as soon as possible because we do do a really good job in this county for all the residents. And we do have data that would suggest that what we are doing is reaching the areas that have been considered inequitable and areas that, you know, that sometimes gets lost. We look at that and we have an equity lens process that we're going to be looking at even more to make sure that we are not leaving anyone behind. So again, this is probably not the forum, but love to have that conversation so that we can bridge that gap. Secondly, we've worked really hard with the boys and girls Club over the past year or so to really build that relationship. In fact, I was at a meeting on Wednesday night where we had a forum with boys and girls Club to talk about their challenges and how we could help them be a more inclusive organization along with us with all of the youth that are participating in boys and girls club.

So again, this is probably not the forum, but love to have that conversation so that we can bridge that gap. Secondly, we've worked really hard with the boys and girls Club over the past year or so to really build that relationship. In fact, I was at a meeting on Wednesday night where we had a forum with boys and girls Club to talk about their challenges and how we could help them be a more inclusive organization along with us with all of the youth that are participating in boys and girls club. And if we want to have a little more detailed information on that, I can have Bill Sheehan come up and talk a little bit about that. But it was a great opportunity and with lots of things learned there on both sides, that suggests that if we just have a conversation, we can make it work. So Bill, would you come up and talk a little bit about what we experienced that night? Thank you. Good morning and thank you. Bill Shann, chief youth and county wide sports division. So yeah, just to follow up, Councilman Burroughs, in support of individual overall Prince George's County Boys and Girls Club, which is the body that oversees the individual unit clubs, we support them with a yearly stipend. We give them office space, administrative support, as well as, you know, working with them for their needs, whether it's individual unit, club, project charges that we supply to individual clubs. The other thing is, as we're coming out of COVID some of our local boys and girls club that have been with us for years, they may be dormant or the individuals that led their groups. So we've been meeting with them. As director Tyler said, we've had some community meetings with boys clubs just to find out what assistance they do need if things have changed over the years. Leadership. And then the final thing, excuse me, I'll add, is we're trying to fill gaps where the boys clubs may not be as successful as they're active, if they have been. So we'll come in, for example, soccer, futsal. Seven v seven has been extremely popular. Some other programs that we're trying to do to fill the gaps or help lift up dormant boys clubs. Thank you Mister Sheen. I'm going to let Mister Burroughs have the final word. But before he has the final word, I'm just going to express my view, which I think I've raised you before. Mister Shapiro, my distinct recollection because I've been concerned about the cost of the headquarters building long before you were appointed. Was that the discussion on the current building? I don't know if this was in public or just like when we talk after these meetings, it was somewhere in the $75 to $80 million range for the building and then another 15 million for upgrades. So I left that conversation a year or two ago understanding it was 90 to 95 million total. The 40 million extra caught me by surprise. And since we're not using bonds and we're using pay go and we're looking at the future. I can understand where council members are concerned. Are we going to run short on funds for programs for people who really need it? And is that money that many of us weren't expecting for the headquarters building all critical, or are there things that can be done to pull that down? So Mister Burroughs may be more passionate about what he feels on this topic. I'm just coming from this is what I remember and I'm taken aback by the number. So just. That's all I can say. I'll turn it to Mister Burroughs, if you could keep it brief, but make your point. I just want to address some of the things that I heard that were that I just think I should put out there publicly when I talk about the advocacy. When it came time for that building vote, Mister Shapiro, I got many texts and calls from you. This is the only time you've invited me and a group of my colleagues, at least that I'm aware of. I can only speak for myself. Asking us to vote for a thing where you gave us a tour, you were very passionate about it. So you've not done that for any youth program, not a senior program. But this building had a lot of advocacy behind it from you that I have not seen on any other issue. And that is just a fact. And I appreciate the last person who came and spoke about what you're doing. I think park and plan is operating in a bubble, and I would like to invite you to some of my apartment complex where we have young people with nothing to do. Ideally, the moment school lets out, there should be a parking, planning bus or van, picking them up, taking them to a community center to engage in some activity. We need to talk about weekend activities and summer activities, ramping all of that up, and then partnering with groups in the community that have the credibility that are doing the work. A lot of the groups that are in the community that are doing the work are operating on shoestring budgets. You should be funding mentoring programs. You should be funding all types of things that will uplift our youth. And this $40 million could be transformational for young children in this county. And it should not go on top of 90, $95 million to upgrade this building. When you gave us a tour of the building, the building looked fine. But we have organizations that are operating out on the side of the road with absolutely nothing. And continuing to invest in this building is, in my view, a misappropriation of what taxpayers are forced to pay and the project charge process has been horrendous. And if we called everyone in a room who was awarded a project charged lawfully by this body and asked, has parking planning helped you through this process or been harmful to you through this process, I'm willing to bet the majority will say harmful.

And so I appreciate the work that you're doing. I love, you know, Wanda Ramos and everything that she does, but this leadership team priorities, I do not believe are in line with what's in the best interest of this county. Okay, Miss Riada, last word. Thank you. And I want to say thank you, council member Burroughs, for your passion and your advocacy that you've done specifically on the work around youth, even before I joined you here on the council. And I just want to echo one sentiment in particular. I feel like I don't think either of us are arguing that point, that there's some amazing programs that are happening across the county at our recreation facilities. But what we're saying is there is this crack in which so many of our young people are falling through, and there's a gap, and we are trying to be a partner to bridge it. And one of the ways in which we do it are, for the example, in conversation, the project charges we're trying to bring to the table organizations that we know we're working with, that are in the trenches of some of the most impacted communities that we know some of our facilities just can't reach based on location and create that partnership. And there is a tension, and it's historic. I don't think it came from just when we came here. There's some historical tension with how that has operated, how it works. And so that we're clashing. And our intention is to say, we see these entities and organizations that are trying their hardest with nothing, nothing, to save the lives of kids in our community. I mean, when I need. When that young man was killed in the front yard at 13, I called one of these organizations because a mom couldn't find therapy because she didn't want to spend the night in her home. These are the types of organizations that are right there when our families need it the most. And all we're trying to do is make sure that the government can help them do that. And park and planning, I think, is a part of that. And so I'm just hopeful that we can figure out how to do that, and it's not a combative thing. We are genuinely trying to figure out a way to extend our resources. And so I know when we say, okay, it's a million dollars going out, it's hard for us to swallow the $40 million. When we're told that we invest, we're asking for a million dollars total for like ten groups, and that's too much. But we can put $40 million in a building, more than we're already spending. That's the tension point for us. Just so we can clearly articulate it. If we could fund everything we brought to the table, every program was fully funded, I would have no problem supporting $40 million more in a building. But if I hear no, no, no, no on programs where I feel like taxpayers are expecting their resources to go, then there becomes a tension point. So I do hope that we can continue this conversation. I do hope that we can figure out a way to do this because we have to work together and we can't do everything as a government. Our nonprofits are a huge part of that. And we as a county government have not done our due diligence to make sure that they have the resources they need to do to fill in the gaps where we fall short. Mister Olson? Yes, briefly. These final words are briefly, briefly, Mister Shapiro, Tyler and your team, I'm sure you would be willing to meet with whatever boys and girls club was out there selling water bottles to get pads and that kind of thing, and see what assistance might be possible, what they might need. I would hope that that would be possible and to work with Mister Burroughs on that issue. And certainly the outreach with within district eight to communities that are in need. Yes, as I said previously, that is the invitation and we've already met with the boys and girls club, but I will say it again, we are willing to have a conversation to see where we can meet, you know, meet the needs of everybody in Prince Rose's county. Right. Okay. I just, I don't know which boys and girls club this is, so I hope that that can be facilitated. Thank you Mister chair. Thank you. Appreciate the discussion. I'm sorry, what's that? Oh, he does. I just want to say, if you allow me, that we have our next town hall forum for sports. It's going to be on April 25 and it's going to be in the southern part of the county. So at southern area aquatics facility. So we invite all the boys and girls club to attend that session and have conversations with our sports team. Okay, thank you, Mister Roberts, Mister Franklin.

I didn't see your hand, Mister Franklin. No problem. Very quickly, is it possible for the Department of Arts and Recreation to put together sort of a list of programs and services that you provide, particularly for low income children in the county, and if that's what low income means, can be a moving charge, determine that. But I do believe that what is missing is sort of that understanding. And even I don't fully know of how you're impacting the county's kids that are mostly, and maybe if you have sort of a breakdown that you sort of look and say well these programs and these services in particular serve our most vulnerable youth populations. I think that will go a long ways to helping us determine whether our most vulnerable youth are being properly served. Is that something that you would be able to pull together? I believe it is, yes. Okay, I recommend doing that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Franklin. I'll just wrap up with one thing. I think one of the problems is that there's a disconnect that I don't know how any of us solve, which is for a lot, I think a lot of children in general and a lot of low income children, it's lack of transportation. As park and planning is going towards bigger centers. Getting children who don't have access to transportation to these programs is really hard. And I know I raised this issue 20 years ago in the council, literally, and Mister Burrows mentioned it. I think it's implicit in some of Mister Franklin's concerns and just came up today that last year you helped fund a bus from a little corner of South Laurel that's isolated to, instead of giving them their own program just over to the Yorkfield run. But you're not going to do it this year because not enough children used it. And I get that, but apparently the number I got was ten children were using it. So it doesn't justify a bus, but it would justify a van because those kids have nowhere to go. They're completely in a community that's completely isolated geographically. But I'm not raising this issue just for them. This transportation problem is a tough nut because it costs money to do transportation. But if you have programs and people aren't coming because they can't get there, how useful are the programs? And you're not a transportation entity. But DPWT's the bus isn't going to solve the problem. So I don't know how we solve this. But transportation is something that I think parking planning seriously needs to look at if you want to reach the children the most need. With that, I think we're finally done. And Mister Tyler, I see you pushing the button. If you want to say a word, then you'll get the last word and then we'll move on. I would like to say yes. I believe that is a conversation we should have a collaborative conversation with entities that can help us and we can help them. You mentioned we're not a transportation organization, but I think we have opportunities that we can do some of those things and we can also work with other entities to help us out. Thank you, Mister Tyler. Thank you, Mister Shapiro, to you and your team. Truly appreciate it. So we will move on to the plan 2035 implementation package in just a second. It.

It looks like it's still two minutes in morning, so I'll say good morning. So good morning. Chair Dunoga and members of the planning, Housing and economic development committee. Again, my name is Tony Felts, and I am the chief of community planning with the Prince George's county planning Department. As mentioned, I'm joined today by Katina Shoelers, chief of county wide planning, Adam Dodgson, the supervisor of the community Planning Division's place making section, our director, Lakeisha hall, and our deputy director, Derek Berlaj. You'll remember that we appeared before this committee on January 18 of this year to provide a broad overview of a package of implementation strategies that the planning department will be working on in the coming year to further the goals of Plan 2035. At that briefing, we let you know that we would come back to this committee to go into more detail for strategies related to growth inside the centers in the Capitol Beltway and outside centers in the Capitol Beltway. The briefing today is related to strategies related to growth inside the centers and inside the beltway. And in this presentation, you will hear a lot about how to make the kind of transit oriented and infill development envisioned in plan 2035 easier and more desirable to build. So, kind of think the right development in the right places. And remember that we'll be back next month at this committee to discuss additional goals, guardrails and safeguards that can be put into place to help manage growth outside the Beltway and outside centers. So let's start off, like I always like to do, with a reminder of about plan 2035. You'll remember that the key takeaway from your plan 2035, which was adopted by the county council in 2014 and which, as you know, sets the county's vision and growth policy, is that the county council and adopting plan 2035 approved a fundamental shift in the county's development pattern away from auto dependent suburban sprawl and toward pedestrian and transit friendly mixed use centers. And what can we do to keep moving in the right direction? We're focusing on four areas, right sized zoning, incentives for in center development, managing growth outside the centers, and providing housing for all. And as you know, zoning is the source from where approvals for new development come. Without proper zoning and regulations in place, the county cannot effectively manage growth. And as you know, zoning itself stems from plan 2035 and the master and sector plans that complement the plan. That's why the planning department is going to propose funding to fully evaluate the county's 38 master and sector plans to see what is working, what isn't working, what is and is not appropriate and complimentary to plan 2035. Because, as you know, many of these plans predate plan 2030 five's adoption. We anticipate that this review will lead to opportunities to initiate plan amendments and possible zoning changes to right size zoning in the county and ensure that proper zoning designations are in place on a plan by plan level. In addition, the planning department is continuing to develop new plans which include sectional map amendments which are comprehensive rezonings associated with adoption plans to ensure that the right zoning is in place. But it's worth mentioning that it's not enough just to have the right zones in place. It's also important that the regulations tied to those zones match the goals of Plan 2035. The next few slides are going to focus on proposed by riot density increases in the centers these centers have special zoning districts referred to as transit oriented activity center base zones. The planning department is proposing as part of the omnibus bill to increase by right densities in these very specialized districts in order to bring the densities in these districts more in line with plan 2030. Five's vision of transit oriented development but numbers on a slide don't really tell the story. The next few slides are going to give some conceptual examples of what these densities could mean for buildings on the ground. So at 80 to 95 units per acre, one would expect to see about a five story building with some ground level retail. These types of buildings are typically wood framed and wrapped around a central garage structure. This would be some of the lowest maximum densities in the transit oriented and activity centers under the proposed omnibus bill at 90 to 100 2010 dwelling units per acre, you would expect to see four or five stories of residential on top of a podium garage. And what a podium garage just really means is a ground level garage that typically covers a full floor and is sometimes wrapped with retail or restaurant spaces below the residential units. So it covers the entirety of that first floor. The difference from the previous example is that the podium garage allows additional residential units on parts of the parcel that would be taken up by a central garage. These types of buildings are still wood frame. Again, they would incorporate commercial space on the first floors. At 125 to 150 units per acre, you start to get more into mid rise buildings with seven or eight stories typical. These buildings are typically metal framed or concrete and incorporate a multi level parking garage directly beneath the housing units and incorporate commercial spaces at ground level. This level of density is efficient for smaller sites in transit areas, and at 150 units per acr", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Prince George's County Planning Department", "insights": [{"observation": "Fundamental shift in the county's development pattern away from auto dependent suburban sprawl and toward pedestrian and transit friendly mixed use centers.", "classification": "Environmental", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Incentivizing development areas and plan 2035 centers and inside the beltway.", "classification": "Social", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Providing housing for all.", "classification": "Social", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The right zones in place are important, as well as ensuring that the regulations tied to those zones match the goals of Plan 2035.", "classification": "Governance", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Increasing by right densities in the specialized districts to bring the densities in these districts more in line with plan 2030 five's vision of transit oriented development.", "classification": "Environmental", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Typical buildings at 80 to 95 units per acre would see around five story buildings with ground level retail.

This level of density is efficient for smaller sites in transit areas, and at 150 units per acre and above, you would expect to see high rise steel, concrete or mass timber construction in very dense and urban locations. Those areas immediately adjacent to transit stations and construction is designed in such a way as to allow for maximum density. These are typically really expensive to construct construct due to code, instructional requirements and the requirements to use steel, concrete or mass timber. But these images are really conceptual. So I wanted to give you some real world examples here in Prince George's county, number one at 101 dwelling units per acre is Santa Paulo. It's right down the road from us here on Lotsford Road in Largo. Number two is University view one at 120 112 units per acre and university view two at 194 units per acre in College park. And number three, landmark is also in College park at 109 units per acre. So hopefully these representative images will give you an idea of the type of development and vision for the county's most important land use asset, its transit stations. But having the right zoning districts and the right zoning regulations in place is of course, just part of the is just part of the equation. Now we're going to look at the other part of the equation, incentives and other policies to encourage and direct growth to the centers. These include prioritizing specific capital projects, eliminating and streamlining the DSP process for in center projects, modifications to level of service inside centers, which Katina will talk about. She'll also talk about impact fees for developments that are inside the beltway, and we'll also explore options to diversify housing options and preserve affordability inside the Beltway. So let's begin with those CIP projects. Scott Rowe from Community planning presented this information to the council on March 19, so I'll briefly recap this content since I think most of you have heard it before. And I want to mention that CIP recommendations are planned to occur from the planning department annually to identify and prioritize key capital projects. To advance the goals, policies and recommendations of plan 2035, we must first evaluate recommendations in the master and sector plans that govern growth and development in the downtown and innovation corridor. Second, we have to go to the downtown and innovation corridor and see the needs with our own eyes, and we must then coordinate with partner agencies to identify what projects they are undertaking or considering and how these projects can best implement plan 2035. I want to recap those priority capital projects that the planning board recommended to the county, state and other agencies to undertake to continue to build on the momentum already generated for plan 2035 implementation. First are two recommendations that are needed in all the downtowns and innovation corridors. One is comprehensive branding and Waif, a comprehensive branding and wayfinding program for each downtown. Everyone who visits that place needs to know that they are in a special, important place within Prince George's county, and they should know how to get around this place, whether on foot, on bicycle or in a car. Second is that the entire county needs high quality bus stops. These are bus stops that make waiting for, getting on or getting off a bus a pleasant experience, demonstrating that the county values bus passengers who do so much do not add to congestion that drivers create. Good bus stops include distinctive shelters made of durable materials, real time electronic arrival and departure information, seating protection from weather, bicycle racks and docking stations, trash receptacles, paved pedestrian access, crosswalks within a block and on those hard roof shelters, green roofing for biodiversity and heat island reduction right here in Largo and downtown Largo, the key capital investment focus on creating a real place that people want to live, work, visit, learn and recreate retrofitting our suburban road network to an interconnected network of complete and green streets is one of the most critical steps Prince George's county can take to increase our economic competitiveness versus neighboring jurisdictions, many of whom invested in complete street retrofits many years ago. Social interaction, public enjoyment and economic activity all occur on the street. Much more than a mobility need. A complete streets retrofit is critical to creating places where people want to be. Accordingly, the first priority projects in downtown Largo are a transformation of its road network, which was constructed to funnel cars in and out of the old Capitol center into a safe, attractive network of complete and green streets where people can walk by, take transit or drive to their destinations safely and comfortably. Key to successful place making is creating attractive public open spaces for people to gather. In addition to the ongoing effort to create a civic plaza here at the Wayne K.

Key to successful place making is creating attractive public open spaces for people to gather. In addition to the ongoing effort to create a civic plaza here at the Wayne K. Curry administration building, the hospital, the metro station and Lake Largo are three other locations where creating great public spaces will attract people to the area. And finally, constructing an amphitheater for downtown Largo is a major investment that will bring hundreds of thousands of people per year and national attention to downtown Largo and increased demand for eating, dining and ancillary entertainment options in Largo. Other investments in downtown Largo that can increase its marketability for new investment but also improved circulation and amenities for workers, visitors and residents are a series of trail connections, most importantly, the Central Avenue Connector trail that will connect downtown Largo with with C. Pleasant, Capitol Heights and the district. Finally, multimodal improvements to the medical Center Drive Capitol Beltway interchange are critical to connecting communities west of the Capitol Beltway and downtown Largo. And next, we move on to New Carrollton, where two major infrastructure investments are underway that will fully unlock this downtown's potential. A new intermodal station that will serve as a gateway to Prince George's county and seamlessly connect riders on Amtrak, Mark, Metro and the Purple Line, as well as inner city and local buses with connections throughout the region and destinations within this growing neighborhood. Retrofitting 85th Avenue and Ellen Road or Maryland 433 to better support pedestrian and bicycle activity are key to connecting new Carrollton with Annapolis Road, which is Maryland 450, and the broader city of New Carrollton. Increasing new Carrollton's attractiveness as a live work play destination starts with improved public gathering spaces, and two locations where placemaking can be prioritized are at each end of Harkins Road at Annapolis Road and Ellen Road by the IR's headquarters for New Carrollton and other planned 2035 centers along the Metrorail Orange line. To maximize their potential, an upcoming restoration of the lower Beaver Dam Creek near New Carrollton metro must be paired with additional green infrastructure solutions, solutions to turn stormwater management features into publicly accessible open space and a comprehensive stormwater management study of the entire lower Beaver Dam Creek watershed. Wilmota has been a key partner in developing the station area throughout its joint development program, and it should continue to partner with other public agencies who own land at New Carrollton to maximize development opportunities. Walking distance to the station at Suitland it is a living example of the power of public investment and unlocking private investments in places where the private real estate market has ignored for decades. Continued investment in the town square at Suitland Federal center creates an in high demand urban neighborhood, walking distance to the metro and thousands of jobs at Suitland Federal Center. A critical next step is retrofitting Maryland 458, which is Silver Hill Road, to better support transit, bicycling and walking along Maryland 218, Suitless Road and Swan Road. A long discussed investment that will build upon the momentum of Town Square is the creation of a formal civic open space at the intersection of Silver Hill Road and Suitland Road. Place making Suitland showed us that the possibilities and demand for civic spaces in improving this place not only gives residents of Suitland a place they can proudly gather and call their own, but tells those who would reinvest in this area that Prince George's county is serious about improving investing in great public spaces. The next downtown is Hyattsville crossing. You'll begin to notice some themes in these recommendations because they are foundational investments critical to creating a baseline environment that supports private investment and reinvestment in these communities. As with other downtowns, retrofitting the main streets to complete and green streets has to be a priority. Bellcrest Road and east West highway continue to serve as barriers to create the type of walkable, mixed use, attractive neighborhood that plan 2035 envisions and need to be transformed into human scale main streets. Stormwater management is also key to unlocking the potential of Hyattsville crossing. The ongoing nine pond project was a key recommendation of the 2016 Prince George's Plaza Transit District development plan, and its completion in the coming months will address current and future storm runoff emanating from areas of Hyattsville crossing that were constructed prior to modern storm water management practices and alleviate flooding downstream on the east side of the transit district. A key next step is doing the same type of studies, evaluation and potentially a similar facility on the west side of the transit district to alleviate stormwater volumes in the northwest branch of the Anacostia river, which could in turn decrease flooding risks surrounding the West Hyattsville station downriver.", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Prince George's County", "insights": [{"observation": "an interconnected network of complete and green streets is one of the most critical steps Prince George's county can take to increase our economic competitiveness versus neighboring jurisdictions", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "transformation of its road network into a safe, attractive network of complete and green streets where people can walk by, take transit or drive to their destinations safely and comfortably", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "creating attractive public open spaces for people to gather", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "constructing an amphitheater for downtown Largo is a major investment that will bring hundreds of thousands of people per year and national attention to downtown Largo and increased demand for eating, dining and ancillary entertainment options in Largo", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "series of trail connections, most importantly, the Central Avenue Connector trail that will connect downtown Largo with with C.

Finally, creating public open spaces where people can safely gather and interact is key to attracting investor interest and improving quality of life. There are two existing plazas that were created with this purpose in mind but are not living up to their potential, the metro station and in the middle of University town center at America Boulevard and Freedom Way. Reinvestment in these areas can enliven them and create civic focal points. The county's innovation corridor includes major national research and development institutions and two regional transit districts, the College Park UMD and Greenbelt metro stations. Two transportation investments are critical to maximizing the possibilities in this area, completing the Purple Line, which will connect students, employers and employees employees throughout the corridor, and completing the interchange on the beltway at the Greenbelt metro station, which would be necessary even if it weren't absolutely critical to support the redevelopment of that station anchored by the new FBI headquarters. As with downtowns, addressing stormwater management in the innovation corridor is a necessary step to ensuring that growth occurs in an environmentally sensitive manner and that the historic lack of stormwater management in the corridor is overcome with new facilities that use best stormwater management practices to create ecologically sound areas that are an asset as well as a necessity to new neighborhoods. In particular, building the urban Conservation park recommended in the 2015 College Park Riverdale Park Transit District development plan can create an amenity for future for current and future students, workers and residents while helping manage stormwater and the very sensitive paint branch and northeast branch watersets. Retrofitting main streets again appears as an important strategy to provide existing residents, students and workers with safe, multimodal access to their destinations and also a prerequisite to attracting new and private investment the city of Greenbelt and Sha have been exploring improvements to Greenbelt Road. Campus Drive is another road that lends itself to a transformation to a modern multimodal street. And finally, at Branch Avenue, the current road infrastructure inhibits safe travel, encourages high vehicle speeds and serves as a barrier between the station area and new developments such as the Customs and Immigration Service headquarters retrofitting Capitol Gateway Drive. Off road and Old Soap Road and off way will go a long way in connecting the station to the surrounding neighborhoods. Meanwhile, two major transit investments can create increased private investment at Branch Avenue. The existing surface parking lot is one of the prime locations in Prince George's county for transit oriented development. Constructing a parking structure can free up a significant portion of this underutilized space for dense transit oriented development. Continued investment in the southern Maryland regional transit system has the potential to bring thousands of riders daily into the branch Avenue station, increasing its attractiveness for retail eating, drinking establishments and other services targeted to customers and commuters. And so now we shift focus to streamlining the DSP process. So the planning department currently has an expedited review process for transit oriented development adjacent to metro station. This existing process shortens the time for projects to get to planning board from about 70 days to 60 days. But really, when you think about it, ten days is not really enough incentive when you think about the life of a project, which can sometimes last for years. As such, we propose allowing simultaneous preliminary plan site plan review, which could shorten approval times from up to 200 days to as little as 100 days. We would like to consider eliminating district council call up for specific transit oriented developments in our regional transit centers, which could remove up to 30 days from the process and reducing fees for simultaneous review. We believe that these small adjustments would have a greater impact on the approval process timeline in order to incentivize transit oriented development, and with that, I'll turn it over to Katina to talk about transportation adequacy. Good morning. My name is Katina Schoelers, division chief of the countywide planning division, and I'll be discussing transportation adequacy and fees associated with school and public safety.

Good morning. My name is Katina Schoelers, division chief of the countywide planning division, and I'll be discussing transportation adequacy and fees associated with school and public safety. Historically, Prince George's county has been heavily dependent on mobility by vehicular transportation. Transportation. The goal of Plan 2035 is to grow primarily in our transit oriented centers, to significantly reduce dependent on driving by creating more opportunities for walking, biking and transit in high density areas. This is what attracts businesses and turns urban centers into urban meccas. Younger generations prefer to live or work in areas with strong biking, biking, walking and transit infrastructure in place as well as access to shopping, places to work, restaurants, entertainment, public spaces, health services and a variety of other uses. Like many suburbanizing areas in the 1970s, Prince George's county instituted inadequate public facilities or as we call it, APF ordinance. The idea behind APF ordinances is that development should not occur unless adequate infrastructure is in place to serve new and existing development. There are a few things you should consider when thinking about adequate public facilities. There is no scientific way to determine adequacy. It is a policy determination made by you, the county council. An APF ordinance is effective only to the extent that it a regulates whether development occurs or not and b is coordinated with jurisdictions. Capital improvement program most existing APF ordinances, including ours, include a test for traffic adequacy that is only achievable in greenfield areas where land and money for road improvements are available. In Prince George's county, what constitutes adequate public facilities is established by the council and the subdivision regulations. When it comes to new development, public facilities adequacy is evaluated at the time of subdivision and the intent of transportation AP test is to make sure that transportation facilities are or will be in place at the time of development to offset the impacts of added traffic from development. It is also to ensure that vehicular traffic will be operating at the establish levels of adequacy in a given area of the county. However, in the centers, how fast vehicles can get through a block is less of a priority. Adding lanes in these centers encourages more vehicular traffic, especially for pass through traffic and travel at high speeds. Allowing a higher level of service or more free flowing traffic through centers will further discourage bike and pedestrian use by creating an unsafe environment. Prince George's county already leads the state and the region in pedestrian fatalities through the subdivision process. The level of service, or los as we refer to, is the common standard used for ensuring that needed infrastructure will be in place and operating to accommodate the new development. Each level is associated with a level of congestion that previous county councils found to be tolerable in a specific area of the county. Next slide please. In the prior subdivision ordinance, three levels of service were established. Each one applied to a transportation service area, or TSA, which is a designated analysis area of the county for traffic conditions, and there are three transportation service areas in the county as shown on this slide. TSA three is a rural and agricultural policy area of the county and has the highest of the county's established level of service in this area. The traffic standard is to have a stable traffic flow at peak periods of the day transportation service area two is primarily between between the US 301 and the beltway, where more congestion is expected but tolerable at peak periods and transportation service area one is generally the area inside the beltway and has the lowest level of service, and congestion is expected to be very high during peak periods. The current subdivision ordinance establishes five levels of service or five levels of acceptable traffic conditions that apply to different areas of the county. The implementation of the current subdivision regulations allowed for all ToD centers to have the lowest level of service regardless of their location. This does not include the local town centers. In addition, zones RTO, LTO and plan development zones were allowed to have an even lower level of service, meaning that these areas allow to have a much higher level of congestion than the rest of transportation service area one. For these zones, consideration is given to the focus of more and safer movement by walking, biking and transit. Movement by vehicle is less of a priority. In summary, the current subdivision regulations has moved us toward lowering the county's acceptable level of service and centers and this map right here. I'm sorry, yes, sorry. Next slide this map here shows the location of those LTO, RTO and plan development zones that I mentioned which have the lowest level of service standard. A majority of them are within TSA one already and I can provide you with an electronic copy if you want to to take a closer look at that map. Next slide please. When development is proposed, staff analyzes the development to determine how density will impact traffic and if the roads will operate at the intended level of service. If they will not, the applicant can meet adequacy the following ways. They can revise the proposal to reduce the amount of development. They can provide transportation improvements such as an added lane, a turn lane, additional signage.

Next slide please. So what are options the council can consider in the centers to incentivize development as it relates to transportation adequacy? One way is further lowering the level of service, and not in just those zones I mentioned, but in all transit oriented development centers. Another is to eliminate level of service in all transit oriented development centers and here, prioritizing facilities for biking, walking and transit and slow traffic to safer speeds. It may or may not be necessary to require a tis or a transportation impact study to be done so that the county continues to assess future traffic conditions. Developer funded or built improvements could focus on transportation demand management strategies or additional multimodal modal options rather than simply adding a travel lane which will attract more vehicles as alternative routes and unattract bikers and walkers. Another option is to identify legally acceptable traffic mitigation strategies and or fees in lieu of adequacy related improvements and lastly, reduce parking maximums and encourage the use of waivers to parking maximums. These options can only be viewed as incentives when it is in a start, contrast to options outside of centers and this will be discussed in future session. Lowering the dependency on cars, increasing ease and accessibility for biking and walking will create places for economic success. These are all issues that warrant further discussion and will be evaluated through Gold Prince George's the update to the county's master plan of transportation next slide. Thank you. Now I will move on to fees subject to the land use code and also subtitle ten of the county code. The county imposes a surcharge fee for public safety and schools to address impacts of new development on these services. Surcharge fees are per dwelling unit and paid at the time of building permit. For the public safety surcharge fee, the amount is $3,123 in transportation service area one and $9,362 in all other areas. For the school surcharge, it's $11,560 inside the beltway and $19,826 in all other areas. These surcharge fees are not applicable to certain types of housing, such as student housing and senior housing. For the public facility surcharge, the fee can be waived for properties in TSA one near a transit station if it is part of a CSP or conceptual site plan. As you are aware, the county imposes a mitigation fee and now move on to mitigation fee. For police and fire advocacy, the county can impose a mitigation fee for failing police and fire adequacy. For police adequacy, a mitigation fee may be assessed if it is found that the response time for police exceeds ten minutes for emergency calls or 25 minutes for non emergency calls. For fire, an impact fee is assessed if travel time from the fire station to the location of the emergency exceeds seven minutes. These tests are only applied to residential developments at the time of subdivision. For police, that mitigation fee is $5,889 and for fire it is $2,061. Next slide. With regard to options inside the transit oriented centers as it relates to surcharge, there is minimal flexibility for the public safety surcharge. The council could consider expanding the waiver criteria for the public safety surcharge. However, for schools, no change is recommended. I have discussed this with Miss Savakis as well as our legal team, and there's very little that can be done at the county level. It would have to. It would mean amendments at the state level for the mitigation fees for police and fire, you can reduce or eliminate the fee. This would require an update to the subdivision ordinance and the mitigation guidelines. So, in conclusion, infrastructure is very critical to the success of any community. Reducing or eliminating infrastructure fees in centers can possibly attract more high density residential development and mixed use development. However, the fiscal impact of this should be further examined. For the county's transit oriented centers, a majority of the necessary vehicular infrastructure is in place, and the envision density is expected to be accompanied by slower moving vehicles that provide for safe pedestrian and bicycle movement. Bikeways and walkways connect people to opportunities, opportunities which attracts desired economic development. This should be the focus of these centers. I will now turn it back to Mister Phelps. Thanks Katina. And just to close it out, it's important that we also continue to focus on redevelopment inside the beltway.

As we've discussed before, it's important for both this redevelopment to occur in such a way as to both preserve existing, naturally occurring affordable housing, but also to allow for the expansion of housing choices, both in choice of housing type and price point. This type of housing choice is referred to sometimes as missing middle. The planning department is proposing to undertake a study to identify to identify areas within the Capitol Beltway and near centers where missing mental housing is most appropriate. The study will also focus on developing a regulatory framework that ensures compatibility with existing neighborhoods. And really, the goal here is to allow maximum choice and option while still allowing someone to drive or walk by a missing middle housing unit and not even know that it's there. Additionally, the planning department will develop strategies and potential code reforms to facilitate the redevelopment of existing platted small lots and other potential housing sites with appropriate appropriate housing of appropriate scale, such as surplus public lands and potentially tax seized properties. The planning department will continue to build and develop relationships with partner agencies and nonprofits to facilitate the development of attainable housing in Prince George's county, and the planning department believes that the activities that we've outlined here will be effective in directing new development into the centers and catalyzing redevelopment inside the Beltway. Each of the strategies presented here will take time, but the planning department is committed to working collaboratively with the county council and partner agencies to take on the task and make plan 2035 goals a reality. On behalf of Katina and the planning department thank you for your time today, and we're happy to take any questions that you might have. Okay, thank you for an excellent presentation. I have a couple quick questions in terms, and I think the recommendations make a lot of sense because we really want to incentivize trans oriented development. Question I have if we eliminate the DSP process, and it's by right, so somebody can come into Hyattsville and put up a building with 150 to 200 units per acre, who decides if that's a good project? If there's no DSP, they just go get a building permit? Well, of course there would still be a review in the planning department, and we feel like the current ordinance that would allow those types of densities has protections and high quality development regulations built into it to where we would be able to provide feedback and get a quality product for development. Additionally, with the county council, I believe last year passed the requirement that development has to be compatible with the underlying master sector plan. We believe that we have a robust review process in place that would allow us to ensure a quality development. There would still be a level of review. My understanding is that park and planning has not yet in the past year found that any dsps were in conflict with the master plan. And I believe we have an amendment to CB 15 that's been floated to drastically change or eliminate, I think, change that requirement. So I'm not sure that the master plan plus the master plans in many cases are out of date, probably less so in the transit areas. Well, that's exactly right. In the transit areas, most of the master plans are either up to date or will be up to date very soon. As we're working on finishing up the West Hyattsville plan, we're working on the port towns plan. We're also working on the blue Line corridor plan. But what I would say in reference to your comments about, you know, we haven't found any projects that were not consistent with the plan. What you're seeing when you see it is kind of the end of the process. There's a lot of times that there's a lot of back and forth with the developers about how to achieve consistency even before it gets to the planning board for an approval process. And that's where that behind the scenes work really gets us to the point where we can say that it's compatible with the plan. Okay, I'm just trying to think. I'll look at my district. So my district abutts the green butt metro station. It's probably closer than even district four to the metro station, even though it's in district four, and I know that they have a height limit issue that predates back to the nineties. If someone came in and said, I want to build a 20 story building right on top of the metro station, which would make a lot of sense, I'll probably get yelled at from people in College park. But a very tall building right on the metro station, be like Silver Spring or something, or Crystal City if it's by right and there's no DSP. I know there's supposedly neighborhood compatibility standards, but what I'm seeing is because park and planning has the Hollywood, Hollywood Park.

If someone came in and said, I want to build a 20 story building right on top of the metro station, which would make a lot of sense, I'll probably get yelled at from people in College park. But a very tall building right on the metro station, be like Silver Spring or something, or Crystal City if it's by right and there's no DSP. I know there's supposedly neighborhood compatibility standards, but what I'm seeing is because park and planning has the Hollywood, Hollywood Park. I think it's Hollywood park, whatever it is, North College Park park and planning property there, would the homeowners who are closest get any notice and have any vehicle in which to raise concerns about neighborhood compatibility issues? I'll defer to James Hunt to answer the question. Thank you so much. For the record, James Hunt with the development review division. So, to answer your question about that, there are no requirements as of today when it comes to those applications because they would go to permitting. They have to get the preliminary plan of subdivision division, of course, but after that, they would go to permitting, and they would have to adhere to those neighborhood compatibility standards, as well as any other standards within the zoning ordinance. But there's nothing built in the zoning ordinance as of today that would require public notice when those do happen. Okay. I mean, I understand why we want to speed the process. I can just imagine the screaming that's going to occur when a skyscraper starts going up. I'm not intimately familiar with the Hyattsville situation, but we've had, as a district council, a number of concerns about trans arena development in Hyattsville. The clay property, the suffrage point. So if those types of projects were to occur and there was no public input or public notice, it's good for getting things done. It also sounds like a recipe for extremely unhappy people. Absolutely. I would agree. I think that, you know, it's an opportunity there to provide public notice in those situations, and we could. That could be something that could be thought out as a part of this whole entire process. I think we would definitely be open to that. But, you know, adhering to, you know, having the opportunity there for the DSP process to kind of be omitted out of there is, I think, a good idea, or we think is a great idea. At the same time, provide the citizens of Prince George's county the opportunity to request a public hearing or to provide more information about this case will be an opportunity as well. Yeah. So one of the items of the new designing ordinance is the preapplication neighborhood meeting. But if there's no DSP, is there a preapplication neighborhood meeting for. So this is, let me back up. What would somebody file under this proposal? Building permit. This building permit. It'll be preliminary plan and then building permit after that. Okay. So there would be notice the preliminary plan. But those are not the kind of issues that people are going to want to deal with as APF and lots and setbacks and those types of, is stormwater management as part of that? That's right. Katina schollers. So they would follow the building permit and the only thing that's required are the necessary accompanying documents. There's stormwater management. There's sediment erosion control, tree conservation plan, landscape plan and building, all the building code stuff that they're required to submit. And so park and planning would have some involvement in the permit review, but not at the level of a detailed held site plan. And so all of those requirements that come along with filing a zoning related application, they would not be subject to those. Right. So there's no pre application neighborhood meeting? No. Correct. I do know that currently, I think, believe for stormwater management projects, the applicant is required to give a notification for those. But it's only tied to that application. I'm not sure if it's tied to the actual permit grading permit. And just as a comment, two comments. One, public safety mitigation. I don't think we ever find anything in public safety is not meeting facilities, the APF. So we don't do mitigation. I think there's been like one case in which mitigation came up. Not recently. There hasn't been, there are some projects from prior failures that are still in progress, but not recently. Okay. Yeah, I'll update you as that. I don't think you need to update us. It's just we're talking about it, but at the moment it doesn't seem to be all that relevant an issue in terms of APF for transportation and centers. I've said this staff before. I think that's a really good idea to eliminate that, although my. Well, not eliminate it. Fee and lieu that goes to bike pedestrian improvements. Now if we want to get rid of fees because we're trying to facilitate, then maybe we don't do that. But on the other hand, taking away the APF nor the normal APF and doing fee and lieu for improvements, that has its attraction, too. That's just my personal opinion. Because at the end of the day, I think improving pedestrian access is probably the better way to spend our money and have the builders spend their money. Oh, there's Mister Olson. Yeah, thank you. I would echo the concerns about the, you know, eliminating a DSP. I mean we want to get Tod going quickly, but if the project is, you know, is the council member doesn't have to pull it up if they're cooperating.

So, I mean, I am concerned about going straight to a building permit. I'll just put that out there. I think we could run into some significant problems. If not, there may be other ways to kind of cut time down. And I'm for that and I'd love to explore that with you. Another question about the small lot development. We've actually seen some and I think a lot of you know this and we've seen some real problems under the new ordinance where developers have been coming into neighborhoods and working to build on these undersized lots that have never been buildable before, putting them between houses where, you know, the residents have always known that they're not buildable. And, you know, I'm for looking at planned communities of smaller houses on smaller lots that are planned and sort of figured out ahead of time. But I don't think that just putting building on smaller undersized lots is the answer. I think that's actually going to create a lot more problems. So, you know, yes to, you know, looking at plan and I'm not sure if that's what you're talking about. Are you talking about like planned communities with smaller houses? Well, what I would say on that is the planning department does recognize that a lot of these old, older historic lots that were platted long before we had subdivision regulations are an asset and an underutilized asset to increase housing in the county. But your concern is definitely heard. And one of the things that we want to do is make sure that any development that goes on these small lots is compatible with the surrounding development around it. And so as a part of that, what we would be looking for is not just a blanket allowance to allow anyone to build whatever they want on one of these lots, but to have some guidelines and some regulations in place that could potentially restrict size or restrict scale or restrict massing to ensure that the product that's being built on those smaller lots would be compatible with the development that's around it. Yeah. So, I mean, we're going to be looking at this soon, but, I mean, I do think we should look at planned communities of smaller houses. I think that's the direction we should be looking at. I agree with you. One of the. And that's something that we certainly can do. One of the things in the missing middle housing study or following up to the missing middle housing study that we do want to do is get an inventory countywide of these smaller lots. Now, of course, some of the difficulty in doing, you know, planned communities of. And what I'm assuming that you're talking about is, you know, massing a large amount of these small, undersized lots. You know, there's different ownerships, there's different, it could be tax liens on different properties. So actually assembling them all into a larger parcel is not an impossible job, but it's a very difficult job. But it's something that we could look at. Yeah. And there are parcels that are sometimes, you know, a couple acres that, you know, could be. Could facilitate that type of a thing that are under unified control. But, yeah, that's a further conversation I wanted to ask about. Well, I do want to echo Mister de Nova's comment about, you know, investment in bike ped infrastructure when development comes in and making sure that there is. I passed a bill, and Mister Balaj knows about that. You all know about it. With creating the nexus between off site improvements for bikeped, I don't want to lose that opportunity because we have gotten a lot built by using that. So I think we have to make sure that we are, you know, ensuring the developers do get people to and from their development on bike and on foot. There's a lot of improvements we need to make throughout the county, especially in our, you know, more urban areas and our transit areas. So developers should be paying and should be developing and building that type of infrastructure. Similarly, parks and green space. I mean, you had talked about, you know, new Carrollton, making sure that we're getting the parks and green space on Ellen Road and other areas. And that is something that we need to make sure is happening as we create density, that we have communities that are green and have the right amount. We're going through tree canopy now, but have green space that are walkable, that we have the appropriate park amenities as well, pocket parks and things like that. So I appreciate your looking at that one question, and I can probably do this offline but this is my last question as we look at New Carrollton. So I'm actually focusing a lot on the Annapolis road corridor right there at New Carrollton, sort of between Veterans Parkway and the Beltway. And I don't believe that's governed by the, by the plan, the transit, the ToD plan. Right. Or does it go up to that? I think the Annapolis road corridor is just outside of that. You know, I mean this is, this is parochial to district three, but it is also very important for the whole county. We should probably be looking at how we.

And I think we need to make sure that that's in place now. And I don't want to misspeak, but I think that's one of the strategies we recommended in the CIP program. Right. Scott, we understand that it's important for that Annapolis road corridor to connect with the nexus to New Carrollton. Obviously there's some challenges there. Topographical, you know, there's a big elevation difference, but it's not impossible. And so that is one of the things that we're going to be championing and advocating for from the planning department. Okay. Yeah. Anything we can do to, and I know plans take time, but to quickly, if there's anything we can do to add it to, you know, the existing plan or something like that, just to make sure that we get it done right as development comes in. I'm working hard to attract development there. So I do think we're going to be seeing development going on redevelopment happening relatively quickly. So I want to make sure we don't lose opportunities and we can talk more offline. Thank you, Mister Orkneys. I have what I believe is a very light question for you. You spoke about, or first of all thank you for a very informative presentation. You spoke about construction of high quality bus structures, street reef retrofits. I'm just curious, I should have asked this question and should know the answer to it. Although these are recommendations, this parking planning and conversations with our Department of Public Works and state highway, just how all this will come into play. Yes sir. Absolutely. We are Scott Rowe, who is out here as our liaison to both SHA as well as to DBW and T. He's also leading the charge on the go, Prince George's master plan of transportation. And he also worked with them very closely on the planning department's recommendations to the council for the CIP. So we regularly communicate with them and we're working with them to identify strategies and potentially funding and grants that could allow for some of these projects to move forward. Okay, thank you. I see Scott Rowe out at a lot of the community meetings, so he's one of the ones you should have. Scott's hard to miss, isn't he? Yes. Thank you, mister chair Missouria. Again, thank you for your presentation. Always good to see you. Just a few quick questions. Always trying to figure out with some of the public safety and behavioral health, school surcharges, et cetera. What's the distance that they can be waived from transit oriented specifically for the public safety? I don't have the answer to that right in front of me, but I'll get that answer to you. Okay, thank you. And then, so going through the presentation, and maybe this was the focus area and there's another way to see the difference. It seems like the focus is a lot around development from the perspective of housing. And is that like the intention or is this supposed to be development that's all encompassing also? Kind of thinking about more from a business side, too. And I say that because, you know, as we know, we are sally bedroom community in Princeton George's county. Like that is where our bread and butter is. And I do know like commercial space and development is changing, but there's like an infrastructure around like restaurants and nightlife that we see, like in DC and Virginia, that we just haven't really capitalized in the same way in Prince George's county. So is that supposed to be in here too, or is this more of a housing focus? So especially when we talk about in our transit districts and our mixtures use areas, it really is that mixed use. You're talking about ground level retail, restaurants, dining and nightlife with the residential on top. I'll just use the blue line corridor as an example. You know, as part of that plan effort, we commissioned a market study to really look at the market for things like a grocery store and for other high end retail. And so we did that both for Blue Line and we did that for port towns. And both times the market study came back and said, which was a little hard for me to believe, but there was not enough residents within that area to support that to support that type of commercial growth. And so by capitalizing on the possibilities for increased and enhanced density directly around our metro stations, it grows the population. It can bring in folks who are making a little bit high over dollar, especially along the blue line and along our other lines, you know, where folks may be commuting out to the district or maybe commuting to Virginia for jobs, but choosing to live in Prince George's county. And so with those residents comes more money, more disposable income.

And so we believe that items like this, that will increase density, getting more heads in beds, as they say, could help us accomplish those goals. So it's all tied together, at least. And one of the things that we saw in some of the new developments that did have, like, retail at the bottom were saying, like, that space stay vacant for long periods of time. And then sometimes there was one project that came to me where it had it written in that it could also switch those bottom units if they didn't get retail space, and it would become a full apartment building. So are there recommendations on how we safeguard from that from happening and making sure that even if it takes time, that we keep those bottom levels specifically for retail? Well, I think that's what we're doing in the planning department. We're really insisting that those commercial spaces be put in. I was in new Carrollton just the other day on a ULI event, and very similar situation in one of the new multifamily units, unit buildings that's over there, there is a space that's specifically set aside, and if you walk into it, you think, my goodness, this looks like something that a Starbucks or a coffee shop would be in. But right now, they're just using it as kind of a residence base with a little snack bar there that's kind of pay your own way. And when I was talking to that developer who had built that project, I said, what's your plan for this? And he said, well, when the market's not there yet, but when the market gets there, we would like to get this space to be a commercial space, like a coffee shop or a small restaurant or something. So I think what we understand is that the market is getting there. It's just not there yet. And I think our developers who build these projects are seeing that potential. So it's really just advocacy on our part, insisting on those mixed use components when we get into these developments and making sure that they're there and ready for when we get enough heads. And is there a way when we're, like, approving a project where it can be set in stone that it has to be used that way? Like it can't revert back to residential? Because that was one of the concerns I had. They said that it's set for commercial, but if they don't get a tenant, it will become, you know, first level tenant space. I don't think that there's any requirement of a code right now, and that's something that we could certainly take a look at in the future as part of this effort, because it is very important that we have those commercial spaces. Right. Because I guess that's just, like, the one concern I have. That to your point, if the market doesn't bear it currently, and we approve a lot, especially around the blue line corridor, and they see, well, you know, we can create x more units that they'll yield towards that, and we'll lose the opportunity for those commercial spaces when the market does bear it. Absolutely. And that's something that we can take a look at. And happy to work with your office and take a look at it. Perfect. Thank you. You know how to get me. Yeah. I got two questions. But, Ms. Riada, heads in beds has been the excuse forever. Even though we have almost a million heads. We don't. We don't have the right heads. I mean, when you read between the lines, that's really what's going on. So the development community keeps demanding more and more density everywhere in the county, but no matter what density you bring, they can't bring quality retail. I mean, this has traditionally been a problem. I mean, literally, 2003, four, five. Heard the same thing. I know. Like at Westphalia. That's what news gays hearing, even though there's so many people in the general area. So I'm not sure what to say. Well, you're right. You're repeating what they say, and they said, the market's not ready. We need more beds. It's not just heads and beds. You're absolutely right. You also have to have quality public spaces where people want to visit. You also have to ensure that people feel a level of safety when they're going there. You're also having to make sure that just what you said, that the people who are in those beds also have an appropriate amount of disposable income where a retailer or a restaurateur feels comfortable going into that area, that they're going to be able to have folks who have disposable income to spend dollars in their establishments. So heads and beds is, I would say, the most important factor, but it is not the only factor. You're absolutely right.

It would not take additional legislation to combine those. Yeah, I thought that was really one of the applicants choice. I don't know that we have anything in place, but I'll check in with James on that. And I just heard about a case that some people are concerned about this moving forward with a preliminary plan and a site plan at the same time. So. Just heard that yesterday. Okay. Blast on your capital funding pages. Sounds great. I'm glad to see that we're, like I said previously, I'm glad to see we're moving forward analyzing this. So the question is, for the slides that you had that talked about the need for certain capital improvements in certain transit centers, does the current county CIP proposal contain funding for these or which one? You can answer briefly now, but I think we ought to see a memo saying, you know, for downtown Largo and new Carrollton. Here's what we're recommending be done, and here's what's funded, and here's what needs to be funded. It's one thing for us to talk about it, but we need to take the talk from PHEd and have it with the, the full council and the county executive as part of the budget negotiations. For the record, Scott Rose, community planning division. Yeah. When we came to present this last month to the whole council, the CIP list, councilmember Olson brought that very issue up. So we're looking at all of the recommendations, looking at the new proposed capital budget, seeing what's in there, talking to the agencies, what's in there, what's buried in a program somewhere, and then identifying which ones haven't, and we'll bring that back to you. Okay. That'd be very helpful. It was really smart. Yes, it was. High quality questions. Okay. I think we're good. It's 01:00 we're going to hold up HHSps if we go any further. Once again, thank you for an excellent presentation. Very thoughtful, very detailed. A lot of good ideas, some that need a little work, but they're good ideas. So thank you very much.

Mister battle, please orient us. Good morning, sir. Morning, Mister chair. Members of the committee, today we are here to review the budgets of the Department of the Environment and the Department of Public Works and Transportation. So procedurally, we do have our usual staff reports prepared by our illustrious staff. We have Mister Josh Hamline here. Mister Alex Hurdle will be providing the staff report on the Department of Environment. Mister chair, we also have presentations from the agency staff. So if you agree, we will have the staff report, brief version of the staff report, and then we will turn to the agencies for their presentation. And of course, we want everyone to understand that the goal here is to spend most of time on the question and answer period. So if that is. If you agree, mister chair, we will turn to Mister Hurdle. Yes, sir. Start with the staff report on the Department of Environment. Terrific. Mister Hurdle, good morning. Good morning. Chair Olson and members of the committee, Alex Hurdle, legislative budget and policy analyst. First off, I'd like to thank the staff of Department of the Environment for their timely response to all the questions that I had. I will try to keep this a review brief, but knowing that this is a very large department and you do many things, so we'll get started and I think we're supposed to have the report up. Okay, we'll try to work on that. Right, I will start. Most of you should have the report in front of you. There we go. On page one. Budget overview. The fiscal year 2025 proposed budget for the Department of the Environment is approximately $260 million, a decrease of approximately $5.9 million, or 2.2%, under the fiscal year 2024 approved budget. As many of you know, there are five funding sources for the department. The Solid Waste Management Enterprise Fund. There will be a decrease of approximately $10 million for the Stormwater Management Enterprise Fund, a slight decrease of 221,000. The local watershed Protection and Restoration fund, approximately 3.5 million increase. And on page 02:00 a.m. i. Not clicking this correctly. Thank you. Page two, we have the general fund, which has an increase of approximately $256,000 and grant funds, an increase of 11.9 million. I'm sorry, $11.9 million with an increase of approximately $1.3 million. In the middle of page two, you can see the budget comparison for all funds from actuals fiscal year 2023 through proposed fiscal year 2025. Authorized staffing account for all classifications is 353 staff members. This is opposed. This is one more than last year's approved for 2024, which was 352 persons. At the top of page three we can see the the pie chart which is general funds for every for the five different funds. As you can see, solid waste is the largest fund at 49.1%. The next largest is grants at 34.8%. Beginning with solid waste, the solid waste fund, we see the budget comparisons the fiscal year 2023 actuals the 2025 proposed on the bottom of page three. Moving to page four. Authorized staffing is 144 full time positions for this division. The attrition rate for solid waste is 4%. Over time for solid waste will be approximately $1 million, which is an increase of $364,100 from the 2024 approved level. The overtime was incurred as a result of necessary scheduling staff for six to seven days per week for both the landfill and the convenience centers operations, and for staffing during emergencies and vacations. The fund balance for the Solid waste Fund the overall net position of the Solid waste Enterprise Fund, which includes both restricted and unrestricted assets, has decreased by approximately $69.3 million since fiscal year 2011, from approximately $7.2 million down to $889,000 at the end of fiscal year 2022. The structural deficit of the fund was driven by significant increases in costs associated with services provided under this fund in relation to small increases and revenues over the years. This includes tipping fees, which were well below regional rates for over the decade, and operation and capital costs association associated with maintaining the officially closed Sandy Hill landfill. If you look on page five, you can see that the tipping rate fees for Prince George's county are well below a number of other jurisdictions in the region. We're the second to lowest next to Montgomery county. Revenues for solid waste will be decreasing, approximately $125.3 million under current year's approved level, primarily due to renegotiated contracts for waste hauler tipping fees.

Moving to page seven if you look at the bottom for contracts for solid waste overall in fiscal year 2025, contract spending is proposed at approximately seventy point seventy one point six million dollars and on to page eight. These contracts are mainly due to haulers, curbside trash recycling and yard waste collection at $46.4 million, as well as the Maryland environmental services, eight contracts for various services at $20.1 million. And just a note, the proposed fiscal year 2025 budget reflects again a negotiated renegotiated contracts for the county's curbside haulers, which includes a tip free neutral clause reducing revenue by approximately $11 million. Moving on to page nine, the capital improvement program. We can see the highlights below in the chart on the middle of page nine. These include all the contracts for the solid waste fund as well as the north county animal Shelter, which currently there is no funds allocated that has been delayed. These contracts are approximately $16.5 million. Moving on to page ten, there's some items for litter cleanup and illegal dumping. The Department of the Environment is on the litter and Illegal tasks dumping task force. The department has also purchased and installed over 50 solar trash recycling compactors and they collaborate with key prints George's county beautiful to promote recycling, litter prevention and beautification within the county. Moving on to page eleven, bulky Trash the department reports that clear the curb initiative has been successful for both the department as well as residents. The latest update for this program will include allowing up to four bulky items to be placed out on the curbside, and in the future there will be scrap metal and electronic recycling by appointment going into the stormwater management fund. If we look on page twelve, we see the budget comparisons from fiscal year 2023 actuals to the fiscal year 2025 proposed the proposed fiscal year 2025 budget staffing includes 68 full time, fully funded positions, which is an increase of one new position when compared to the fiscal year 2024 approved level, and the attrition rate of this division is 5%. Moving on to page 13, the fund balance for the Stormwater Management fund is projected to be $125.9 million and fiscal year 2025 is projected to decrease to $148.5 million. Since fiscal year 2011, the fund's restricted balance has decreased by approximately $166 million. Mister early and I had a discussion on this deficit and we discussed a number of options for the structural deficit, which has gotten worse, which includes property tax increases, cost minimization of stormwater mitigation and additional funds from the general fund. The proposed revenue sources of the stormwater fund are increasing to approximately $113 million, which is approximately $221,200, or 0.2% under the current year's level. The largest line item for the revenue increase is property taxes at $850,000. Moving on to page 14, you can see the chart for the Stormwater Management Enterprise Fund proposed for the 2025 budget. At the bottom of the page you can see the largest operating expenses for this fund, which includes interagency charges at 26.5 million, as well as principal at $20.2 million. Moving on to page 15, again, a chart with all the operating expenses for this fund. Page 16 in the middle of the page we have some information on the climate action plan. The department's proposed fiscal year 2025 budget contains specific line items identifying over $5 million to be spent directly on climate action and resilient activities. The the department also reports that there's approximately $88 million in county operations and capital expenditures that were identified related to climate action. This includes proposed budgets from several county agencies. Moving on to page 17. In the middle of the page you can see some notes from the sustainability division. I just wanted to mention that the department has developed the new tree track mobile app known as the Tree app. Staff will use this app to track tree plantings and maintenance across multiple grant projects and operating programs, and I'm sure miss Crooms will want to talk about that. Moving on to water quality page 18 we can see the budget comparisons again from fiscal year 2023 through the proposed 2025 staffing for water quality. There are ten full time positions and remains unchanged from last year's budget and there is no overtime in the fiscal year 2024 and none proposed for the fiscal year 2025. The fund balance for the water quality fund balance net position as of June 30 of last year, I'm sorry, 2023 was approximately $124 million and this has increased by approximately 48 million from the prior year.

Moving on to water quality page 18 we can see the budget comparisons again from fiscal year 2023 through the proposed 2025 staffing for water quality. There are ten full time positions and remains unchanged from last year's budget and there is no overtime in the fiscal year 2024 and none proposed for the fiscal year 2025. The fund balance for the water quality fund balance net position as of June 30 of last year, I'm sorry, 2023 was approximately $124 million and this has increased by approximately 48 million from the prior year. The projected unrestricted net position for fiscal year 2024 is $128.6 million and for fiscal year 2025 is proposed to be $137.4 million. Moving on to page 19, you can see the revenue comparison and the chart at the top of the page. The proposed fiscal year 2025 revenues for the Clean Water Act Fund are increasing by approximately 3.5 million, or 17% over the fiscal year 2024 approved budget, primarily due to appropriated fund balance of $8.57 billion. Moving on to page 20, we can see at the top of the page there's the proposed operating expenses for the water quality fund. The largest expense within this fund is operating contracts at $13.2 million and this includes the clean Water partnership, master maintenance and master programs. Moving on to page 21, this is the general fund and we see the actual comparisons from fiscal year 2023 through proposed 2025. Staffing for the general fund includes funding for 121 out of 122 positions and as of March 15, 2024, the budget reported 24 vacant general fund positions. These mainly include hard to find positions that include vacant animal control officers. Moving to page 22, on the top of the page we find the attrition rate for this fund is at 13% in fiscal year 2024. Year to date, resignations are attributed to opportunities in the industry that offer higher salaries for operating expenses for the general fund. We find on the middle of page 2022 your office automation at approximately 785,000, operational contract services and general and administrative contracts. Moving on to page 23, we find operating expenses, the chart thereof and 2020. I'm sorry, page 24 highlights of the general fund there have been challenges within the animal Services division regarding the ability to expedite filling vacancies with viable candidates addressing the animal zoonotic outbreaks and the rise of in prices of pharmaceuticals. There are also challenges of overcrowding of animals at the Animal Services division, which has exacerbated diseases. The department is also planning on hiring a grants writer to help search out grant opportunities. Moving on to page 25, I just wanted to mention in general fund other some notes on the trees and Woodlands Conservation Fund funds were added to and expended from the Woodlands Conservation Fund for tree planting projects and other uses in fiscal year 2023. The fund's financial balance continues to climb from 2.2, approximately $2.2 million to $2.3 million during the course of fiscal year 2023. The department has indicated that raising fee and lieu rates within the county is appropriate given the department's needs, sustaining funding resources to fund its tree programs and moving on to page 26, this is the capital improvement project for the north County Animal Shelter. As you can note again, this project has been delayed. There will be no funding for this this year. At the bottom of the page are some references to grants in fiscal year 2025. The proposed grant funding for the Department of the Environment is $11.9 million and represents an increase of $1.3 million, or 12.3% above the fiscal year 2024. Approved and moving to page 27, there's the table on the stormwater Management District Capital improvement programs. The total for these programs is $62.6 million. Moving on to page 28. At the top of the page you can see the funding comparisons by amount for the CIP program for the stormwater Management district, the largest part being other, which includes the Maryland Water Quality revolving fund loans, low interest loans. And for page 29, we find a table of projects that you saw on the previous page, which includes location, project class and estimated completion dates. And with that, that completes my report. Thank you. Thank you, mister Hurdle. I appreciate the thorough report. Next we will go to the agency director crooms, how are you this morning? Good. Good to have you. Terrific. There we go. Now I'm real. So I'm going to try to do this pretty quickly, but it helps because it's. Because it's visual. So here we go. Maybe I know what I'm doing. There we go. So I think this kind of helps to lay out where our money comes from, since we have this highly complicated budget. So just what's funded by the general fund is animal services, the director's office and strategic services division, enterprise funds. We have the solid waste fund that funds the resource recovery division. And we've moved some of our legal dumping and litter reduction work to the resource recovery or to the solid waste fund this year, stormwater. That covers stormwater and sustainability, including some small parts of energy, which is in sustainability, and then watershed protection and restoration, which is managed by SMD, but primarily the work done by the Clean water Partnership. Grant funds go across the agency. And then we have two CIP funds, what's called the Environment fund, which is the solid waste fund, and the stormwater CIP. You guys already saw this one, so we're going to go ahead and move on. So big changes in the general fund. The position that was mentioned is a veterinarian, which is really important.

We in partnership with the health department on both managing the zoonotic outbreaks and the facility, as well as dealing with the public health consequences thereof, and trying to get more work done out in the community to have more folks have animals that are properly vaccinated. And, you know, as always, we try to get them properly restrained. Solid waste, we mentioned. So we have a new trash collar contract that starts on July 1. That contract is $54 million. Our old one was $50 million. So it said there is a cost increase, but there's a revenue decrease and a cost decrease, which means that it really is a cost increase. Right. We removed the tipping fees. So there were tipping fees before we had our own haulers paying tipping fees. We removed those because when you provide more certainty to the people that you're contracting with, you get a better price. So to them, they never knew exactly how much waste was coming in. They can't control that. And so they were hedging their bets around that tipping fee. So by removing that tipping fee, we think that we got the best prices possible from our haulers, and we were able to get all county based, minority owned small business haulers, all starting on July 1. One new hauler and a lot of haulers that have reduced areas, and a lot of haulers have increased areas. So we think we've balanced it out. So the county is going to get better service because folks are operating within their capacity. And also we have, you know, we know where they are, there more distinct areas that are closer together so they can provide better service. And that contract not only provides our existing services, which are composting trash and garbage and recycling, but also we will be able to now, and of course, we already have our in house scheduled white goods and tires. We now have four items of bulky trash that folks can put out with their regular collection on a weekly basis. And folks will be able to schedule both electronics pickup and scrap metal pickup. So that's pretty exciting. The other major things that are going on over in solid waste is the continued construction of Area C, which maintains our landfills viability till at least 2080, and moving the lots across the street so that regular folks don't have to wait in line with all of those trucks to get in and get rid of the items that they want to dispose of. So those major constructions are ongoing as well as the improvements of the leachate facility that go along with that. We mentioned a little bit that there is a cost increase because we have ramping up requirements around both standard maintenance and landfill gas associated with our closed landfill and around landfill gas associated with our open landfill. So we continue to have higher regulatory requirements and we are doing some testing that actually the General assembly passed this year. But we were already doing to look at PFAS as we are likely to be considered an industrial emitter to ws for our legion. So we really want to understand what's happening there. And we really want to understand at our organics composting facility what PFAS may exist in that final product, stormwater. We mentioned that there's one additional position, that is the climate officer position. We did finish the climate action implementation plan. It's been submitted to the county executive. We're awaiting the big rollout of that. But we have really a strategic roadmap to getting a lot of things done around climate from the recommendations that came out of the climate action plan. But these are the internal government work to actually get it done. I think Alex covered what the increases are here and we covered most of the projects that are going on here. Some highlights really, that we're continuing these watershed studies which will give us more information on how to equitably do work around both flooding and our standard stormwater work. We have ever increasing regulatory responsibilities here. We right now have two overlapping permits, but we are on track to be in compliance with the state with the projects that we are doing now, both in house and through the Clean water Partnership, the same thing kind of under the local Watershed Protection Restoration Fund. Again, this is the clean water partnership work that continues to make sure that we are in compliance with our regulatory requirements, but also does a lot of work around economic development and workforce development in the county, creating and uplifting and growing county based businesses, and giving a lot back to the community in terms of tree planting and education and that kind of thing. And so grants, I mean, we're going hardcore after grants, both internally, and a strategy that we're approaching this year is to not always have the grants come into the department, but rather to work with partners to have the work done in the county, but not overseen by the department, which means that we can leverage money without having to increase staff and without having to increase our own compliance and reporting responsibilities.

So, for example, we partnered with MCEC, which is the Maryland Clean Energy Center. I think they gave you guys a presentation last year about their work. They got a $64 million grant the other day, and a substantial portion of that is allocated to the county for work that will be done here through partners that we don't have to directly be responsible for. We similarly are going after other climate grants through the University of Maryland, through the CoG, et cetera, and looking for partners to not always have this money be money that we have to manage, but have the work and improvements done in the county and have it done in an equitable way. So these are some highlights of things. We obviously, we got the USDA Smart Commodities award a few years ago. At this point, it was a very long negotiation to actually get this formally awarded. It was like they wanted to come out and do the big splash with the county, but then a lot of long process to actually get it to come in the door and we are ready to deploy it. We have the right staff in place, and we're partnering the soil conservation district on this one, the EECBG grants, which is actually what I ran when I was in the Department of Energy. That formula grant is guaranteed $900,000. That will work to expand some of the work that we do with our ERC communities in terms of community outreach and grants that go directly to the community, as well as get us set up for the responsibilities that will fall on the county based on the state's new rules around building performance. Similarly, we went after a larger EECBG grant that will allow us to expand our work in renewable energy and energy efficiency for our residents, the consumer recycling, education and outreach grant that we went after. We won one of these last year and were able to expand our composting program to now 26 schools. So 26 schools in the public school districts now have composting programs in house where the kids are doing that at lunch. Theyre learning how that works and then taking that home to the green bins that we've provided to folks across the county. It's pretty standard for us to go after the CBT grants and, you know, there's a few other grants that we're going after and looking for more. We just hired a new grants writer. We have a grants compliance person and we have a grants administrator. So this gives us a pretty full grants team that will be able to both bring the grants in and keep us compliant with them. That's what I got. Great. Thank you very much, director Crooms. Let me next, we'll go to questions. So let me. I'm sorry, mister early. Do you have any comments? Thank you. Just one brief comment. The, as was discussed, we do have a, a difficult situation between our legal requirements with the state in terms of, particularly in terms of stormwater, but in other areas, too, but particularly in terms of stormwater and our resources. And one of the well items can be managed for this year. This coming year going forward, we do have to put ourselves in a position to be able to get additional money. So we are probably looking at some significant adjustment in the following year's budget. Not this year's, but not the one we're doing, but the next year around stormwater and around our stormwater fund and around getting more revenue into it. Yeah. Well, you know what, mister Early? I think we're going to have to have some serious conversation around that over the coming months then, because we're preparing for next year. Right? I mean, what I mean is for the 26th budget. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We're gonna have to. Have to have some serious conversations about that. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Miss Fisher, do you have questions? Thank you, chair Olson. Thank you. Director croons for your. For your leadership. I just have a few quick questions. I do want to recognize your deputy director Caldarlie. Am I saying that right? Calderly. Calderelli. Her, myself and mister chair have been speaking on email, but really trying to figure out for me, and especially when you talked about your education grants specifically, I would like to know about if any of those grants are specific for the immigrant community and like, the latino community in education when it comes to, like, our litter, our trash, our recycling programs, because I really feel like there's a lack of education. We have so many new prince Georgians all the time. And so I wanted to hear a little bit about what your concrete plans in the grant or in your current budget that you have specifically for those communities in education and outreach. Yeah. So we are currently in the process of looking strategically at our communications.

immigrant community and like, the latino community in education when it comes to, like, our litter, our trash, our recycling programs, because I really feel like there's a lack of education. We have so many new prince Georgians all the time. And so I wanted to hear a little bit about what your concrete plans in the grant or in your current budget that you have specifically for those communities in education and outreach. Yeah. So we are currently in the process of looking strategically at our communications. So we had a sort of long term communication strategy under beautification that was under one particular contract, and that contract ended this year. So we're looking strategically at what partners we can use. In the past, we've worked with Eco Latinas, we've worked with different de la Cuenca. This year we're working with their acronym is CAF, and I forget what the name of the, oh, Centro de Pollo familiar around a grant that I think that you reached out to Deputy Director Calderelli about that we're working with them and the University of Maryland to try to work on air quality issues and try to work on urban heat issues. We have, I mean, we've translated everything in the department, but we understand that that's not sufficient. So we're working a lot on trying to do videos that I think have a lot more value to outreach to our hispanic and latino community and really focusing on understanding. We did a project right before the pandemic, I want to say 2019, where we really looked at where we were having challenges around recycling. And one of the areas that we were having a lot of challenges around recycling was in Adelphi. And so we did some interviews in Adelphi, specifically with owners, folks living in single family homes that were from the latino community, and learned a little bit about what type of outreach worked well with that community. And so we can duplicate that. But we have a more limited budget for outreach, but we're looking to do it more effectively and more efficiently. So I'd love to have you be part of that conversation as we're figuring out what we want to do moving forward. Yeah, I think that would be great. And I would never speak for chair Olson, but I think both of us would really like to be a part of that and what kind of organizations you are looking at, because we actually know if they do something or they don't do something because we're there every day. And I would appreciate that. The other thing I wanted to, it kind of dovetails how many questions keep going. Okay. It kind of dovetails with education, but also our Bates trash pickup contract. You know, I've talked a lot about, I was just responding to an email about a constituent about rats and different things and the overflow of trash and the receptacles and there's just, there's just a part of me that says, if you drive around, my community is usually Tuesday, but whatever the day is, and you can see the house has like tons of bags of trash and they're not in the receptacle, and the receptacle can't close. Why can't we, as a county, just leave an extra receptacle with a note in English and Spanish and communicate it the night before and you can see it on that evening route. It's not that hard. And I feel like, I mean, the concept of, I mean, I think the concept of we don't want to reward families or housing that are kind of using more of the, I guess, the sanctioned receptacle thing. I don't know if that mentality even still exists. I remember there was that mentality at one point. I just feel like it's overflowing. We're in a housing crisis. You have multiple people, especially in my district and councilmember Olson's district council member Ivy's district and councilmember de Novos and others that have a lot of single family use turning into multifamily use, and they need more trash receptacles. And that's just what it is. So I wanted to understand, one, what are we doing about that? And two, especially in the. And you know, I love the, the. It's usually young men that work at Bates. I was with them at Wawa and saying, I appreciate it, but I was like, when you get on my street, do it right. Don't leave the trash everywhere. And the thing is, when they're also picking up trash in a home, that's meant for four people, but it's got 15, that receptacle is super heavy, so they're lifting something that's like 90 to 90 pounds to 100 pounds consistently on their body and their person, and then you wonder why they leave stuff in the street, and then people are mad. So I want to know what's going on with making sure our trash cleanup is effective with baits. And also like, can we go around at night? I'm sure every council member would offer to come with and hand out at least this one would, an extra receptacle or two where it's just overflowing because the long term is the rats, the complaints, and the quality of life going down is more, it's more money than putting out some extra receptacles. I think we would have to have a consistent policy around that. Right now, currently, our policy is if you want an extra receptacle you either go to Home Depot and get an extra receptacle. You put out as many receptacles as you want, as long as they're, you know, properly labeled. But we don't give them out without a cost. We would have to look at that holistically. Right. Because we don't want to do it in an inequitable way. Right. Where some folks feel like they have access to it and some folks don't. The new trash contract includes the requirement and responsibility on the haulers to note when there's problems, they can take photos, they can send it to us right away. We have that information. So where they're seeing, you know, a trash can that's overflowing or multiple bags, they can send us that information right away. So we will have that data now. Right. So we have that information.

So that if somebody calls in and says they didn't get their trash picked up, then we know if they haven't done that, then we know that it was probably there in a real miss. Right. So we have some ability to verify things that we weren't able to verify before. So I think we need to. I don't think I can answer that question today. We'd have to look at what is the budgetary impact, and we'd have to look at the policy holistically. Currently, our policy is not that, but I'm open to figuring out what we would do. I just think we have to do more. And it's funny, I was on two streets away from me and I saw like, a large rat the other day. I was like, oh, my God, no. And I would say, I don't know about that picture working, because 80% of Lewis sales over the two receptacles, I'll tell you right now, that's new. This is in July. So this is the new contract. And then the other part of the new contract. I don't want to interrupt you. Yeah, no, go ahead. I was going to say the other part of the new contract that I think is going to make a big difference is that we had a large percentage of our county covered by one or two haulers. And in light of how hard it is to hire people, how hard it is to get trucks all of those things, we believed that folks were underperforming because they were above their capacity to handle it. So if you don't have these haulers having to do way more than is possible to do with one human being, then we believe that we will have better service. Right? That is what we think. We have the ability to not work with haulers if they continue to not have better service. We think that we have adjusted it. We think that we have the right number of haulers. We no longer have haulers who own multiple companies at the same time operating in the contract. We've made the contract a lot more equal and a lot more fair. And so I think that we will have better performance. That is what we are going after. If we don't have better performance, we also have better measures in place to be able to deal with that performance. So I think that there is a way to handle that. I think for the receptacles, let's have a further conversation about it and figure out how we would do that. Because it's a significant policy change. We'll be changing everything we have on our website, everything we have on 311, what we tell people. We would have to adjust that because I don't want to do it in an unfair way. But like I said, I think they're looking at me like, I have to wrap up, so I'm going to say my last question. It's fine. I do think we can know. You can ask that question. I do think that having an offline conversation about the recycling bins and the trash bins is worthwhile. Okay. And then my other question, with our stormwater grants and things like that, I wanted some more clarity on. And I know there's been some emails Sakinda will let me know. I know I've talked a little bit about what I've been interested in any federal grants that we're looking towards, especially in my community on West Park Drive, there's the Anacostia watershed, and you have purple line on top of it and everyone knows there's flooding there. I feel like, and maybe I missed it, maybe there was an email. I really don't know. But what is our federal. If you can talk a little bit about our federal inquiry and grants like that to kind of shore up those areas and like, I just know that one specifically in my community, that really needs something. I'm not an expert. I don't know if it's a retaining wall or whatever it is, but it needs, it's flooding, and now we're going to have purple line driving on top of it. So I'm like, what are we doing there? And in specifically, I don't know if like on our side of the purple line as well. Like have we looked at all the potential impacts of that on stormwater management flood? Maybe it doesn't have any impact. I'm not an engineer, but I look at it and I'm worried. And so I just wanted to know what we were doing there and what federal infrastructure dollars are there for that. Right? So for, so I always try just to baseline set the requirements. We are required to deal with water quality. There is not a requirement for us to deal with flooding. So we spend the majority of our stormwater dollars on dealing with water quality. That is the quality of the water that comes off of our overland and impervious surface and goes into the Chesapeake Bay. So the vast majority of this money that we're spending is to meet that regulatory requirement where we can we meet that regulatory requirement with the co benefit of dealing with flooding. We have a limited number of flooding projects that are funded with our own dollars. There's been a lot of learning through the Bladensburg flood project about where we might be able to get dollars.

We have a limited number of flooding projects that are funded with our own dollars. There's been a lot of learning through the Bladensburg flood project about where we might be able to get dollars. Traditionally, we've gone after dollars that come out of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. There are a lot of challenges to access that money because of the way that the ratios are set up for cost benefit within FEMA. That has been very challenging for the county and has been a problem that we have asked, you know, the federal government to solve, particularly in light of justice. 40 because of the way that we have historic disinvestment in our community because of who our community is. In a lot of times, the federal government does not value our community because they don't have enough hospitals, we don't have enough grocery stores. We don't have enough of the things that the federal government wants us to protect. So we wind up with this challenge where we go after federal infrastructure dollars and we can't get them because of, you know, racism, I mean, to be frank. Right. Because of the systemic disinvestment in our community. So we're trying to work on that at the federal level and we've, we've worked with our federal legislation, legislation, you know, our federal delegation a little bit on that. But it's, it is a, it is a substantial problem and one that we see again and again. We've gone after these, these dollars under these, these programs and we can't get them. We also have problems with the way that we're defined from an environmental justice standpoint because of the amount of overall wealth in the community and our location. When you compare us to, you know, rural Alabama. Right. It looks very different. And so we struggle with getting the federal government to understand the complexities of our community, and we're doing better. We're getting little pieces here and there. We do have a substantial investment by the US of engineers in the Anacostia watershed around sort of dealing with some of the historic ways that we've used the watershed to manage water. That's a $62 million project. It's been delayed because a bridge fell down in the IR's army cover road series is all hands on deck up there, but it is substantial and it will, we think, help some of the downstream flooding programs because they're going to re naturalize some of the, some of the areas that are upstream of your community, and doing that gives more space for the water to go so that it's not coming into your community so quickly and then causing flooding. We're learning more about what the grants are. We're seeing the state slowly but surely change the way that they approach things. We're going back to the state on a series of grants that, or, I'm sorry, a series of loans where in the past we've been eligible for forgivable principal, that they have now changed the rules. Ironically, since now we're supposed to be doing more about environmental injustices, but to not be forgivable. So there's a lot of different places that we're trying to, like, break this money loose. The biggest challenge is that the areas of the county that are the most built up. Right, that have the most roads and culverts and, you know, the places that are close to the city, like your district, are the most expensive and hardest to deal with. Right. And I think that is a national problem in stormwater that we don't always know how to deal with. It is really expensive to dig up existing infrastructure to rebuild things, and that's what we need to do in those places. Right. Because we have the impact of development upstream that is putting a burden on your community that we don't have the resources to deal with. And so we're actively meeting with those organizations. We're actively trying to change those definitions. We are actively going after every climate grant that we possibly can to try to find ways to do those projects. And we've tasked the clean water partnership with trying to figure out how to do those harder projects, because a lot of times what we do is we do the easier project with the stormwater pond that's further out, that is at or outside the beltway, because we've got the space to do it and it's less expensive to do it, and we have to meet the regulatory burden. So there is an overall cultural change within infrastructure development that needs to happen. That has been messaged as a value judgment by federal leadership, but has not yet made its way into implementation, that we're really trying to work its way into implementation. So we're planning for it, but we're not there yet. So unfortunately, I don't have an easy answer, but it is something that we're aware of. Maybe you can talk offline on that as well. And the purple line clearly needs to be discussed with. Maybe with Mister Briggs at the purple line, if you have concerns about the specific area. Yeah. Any other questions? Okay, vice chair Harrison. Thank you, mister chair. Just to one statement or comment and one question. Director Crooms, councilmember Fisher was talking about kind of trash pickup and receptacles.

So there is an overall cultural change within infrastructure development that needs to happen. That has been messaged as a value judgment by federal leadership, but has not yet made its way into implementation, that we're really trying to work its way into implementation. So we're planning for it, but we're not there yet. So unfortunately, I don't have an easy answer, but it is something that we're aware of. Maybe you can talk offline on that as well. And the purple line clearly needs to be discussed with. Maybe with Mister Briggs at the purple line, if you have concerns about the specific area. Yeah. Any other questions? Okay, vice chair Harrison. Thank you, mister chair. Just to one statement or comment and one question. Director Crooms, councilmember Fisher was talking about kind of trash pickup and receptacles. And as you know, you're a district now resident. Some parts of the county don't get trash picked up, some parts of the county don't get trash bacon. And I just wanted to know, just an action plan, not now, but is there a plan in the future, maybe five, six years away, that we've actually looked at a way that we can improve service across the county within those areas. While councilmember Fisher talked about rats and, you know, in our district, we have deer, we have foxes, we have coyotes, we have all sorts of things that come out there. So, yeah, I just wanted to know if there was a plan around that. You know, I know that the people of the south, that's one of the complaints that we get. They pay taxes, but don't get trash pickup. Well, I do want to clarify that they do not pay for trash pickup, and that is a separate payment, but they do pay for the benefit fee, right. They pay for the system's benefit fee. So there's two separate charges. And they do pay the systems benefit charge that keeps our landfill open, but they don't pay directly for trash. So it is a paid first service. We did a survey in 2014 asking folks if they were interested, and there were certain communities that were in certain communities that weren't. We've seen dramatically more development in that area and we're seeing it every day. Right. And so I think we've talked about the feasibility of it. We considered putting it in the current trash contract. We thought it would add so much complexity that we wouldn't get the best price from the haulers for the areas that we already served. But we've already talked a little bit and actually scoped out a little bit what that would look like. We have the mapping data. We have the data from MNC, Ppc. We do have the intention of sitting down and trying to figure out, okay, if we were to expand services, where would we expand services? Where do we have the density to provide the services? I mean, I contract with one of our county haulers who does a great job, but I pay about twice what I would pay to the county if I was getting that same service. And I don't get, I mean, I don't know that I need it because I live on a farm. But composting service and folks are served by bulky trash pickup, tire pickup, the things that we want to make sure so that folks don't have to haul the really heavy things to the landfill. And so they're not hiring someone who may or may not make the right choice of where to bring it. Right. So we try to handle that to deal with the dumping issue. No, it's something we're really interested in. I don't think it needs to be five or six years out because it is a service that would be provided for a cost. So I don't see it as being something that would have a huge cost to the county. So it's something I'd like to work on in the next, maybe two years to really find out what folks want and provide it. I do. I have a few people that regularly let me know how they feel about that, and I'm sure let you know how they feel about it. And I would love to have a county based service rather than having to contract on it on my own. So, yeah, we'll work on it. Thank you and appreciate your leadership in that matter as well, Mister Ehrlich. So one of the things that, from the presentation that I got is that we are deficient pretty much with how we're collecting revenue for stormwater management. And I really would suggest to the chair that when he talked about having a serious conversation, that we really understand as the legislative branch what that investment needs to be made over the next four to five years, where we sit, what we need to do, and how do we get to a point where we can feel confident about where we are with our stormwater management process and then the infrastructure needs as well. Where are we when it comes to infrastructure? Okay. And I will say there's been a lot of preliminary work, and a lot of it has actually been done by some of the people from department Environment are sitting up here. So yeah, there's a lot of. There's more work that needs to be done, but there is a lot of preliminary work that's been done. Yeah. Thank you. And Mister battle, we should add that to our list of things for later in the year to look at and have conversation around. Mister Durnoga is online. I don't know if he has any questions.

The memo refers to $88 million worth of expenses throughout the county government. I assume that mister. Mister Hurdle has a list of the. I haven't seen it. That's something gives us. We have a spreadsheet for that. Sure. Okay. Okay. Because my last question was more from is Skinner. I assume she's there. Yes. Every. Every year here, particularly this year, I hear from a local residents about the north county animal shelter. So I pulled information on that. So, program was FY 2018, which is. Which is under the Bay administration. And two things. One, not $1 has been spent under the. Under the Alstar Brooks administration. And the current budget pushes this out after the also books the most administration conclusion. So one observation does not seem to be very important to the administration. The second observation is that the proposed funding cost has not changed from 7.1 million in the FY budget to current budget. So clearly. Clearly it's not a $7.1 million endeavor. Maybe Mister Skinner can address why this is priority. Good morning, Mister Danoga. I appreciate your observation. I can't answer the shift or why the funds weren't spent on that in the northern part of the county, but I would definitely take a look at that and circle back with you offline. Sure. I made a spread for you. For you. I'm sure you do. You know, I know I did. But as I understand the origin of this college park, we're the instigators of this project. It keeps. Keeps getting pushed. The money that's in the budget for the first year, if it ever gets spent, is for design. I know. I know that time to time, this comes up. There's no location even selecting location that's been looked at or sized upon. No. I mean, strategically, one of the things, though, that I've started to work on, because I do hear a lot of demands for this. We do have an SPCA humane society in the county. They have a building that is on county land that needs to be replaced. And I don't think they want to make that investment on the place that they are now because there's a long term vision, I think, by the county for other uses for that land. Some of the models that we've looked at, so I've met with leadership in other counties met and leadership in other areas, is there is a possible model that I don't think was explored in the 2000 820 16 study of some kind of provision of land by the county or one of the municipalities and operation by a nonprofit and ownership of a building by a nonprofit that might be more affordable for the county. I mean, so I have had a lot of conversations with folks from the municipalities and what their challenges are compared to the challenges, you know, that we have in the main facility. And, of course, the biggest challenge is getting animals to our facility from way up there. But I think we're starting to explore, you know, what are the different options that could be there. I think my priority has been to get our current shelter better operational and our current services that we provide to the community better operational. Yeah. So we have not scoped out land, haven't really looked at what's in the portfolio. I'm looking at the portfolio right now. Relevant to. Relevant to energy. Right. So can we use some county land to put some solar panels on and make some money? So I'll have you know, I can certainly talk and look at that portfolio from that perspective, too, but. Yeah, that's right. I have a follow up question. You and Miss Skinner. We have a plethora of work groups, task forces, missions, and we really don't need another one, but. But perhaps a work group. Just look over where things have gone 2016. Look at. Look at the item. Start trying to refine location and the non profit model. And I'm thinking we include representatives. I don't know, stakeholders at least, at least we're eight years came up. 1st. 1st it's probably a good idea to put together for a meeting or two, maybe a meeting, Mister Danoga, I think it's a good idea, but I'm not going to commit right now to anything. But I don't see why we wouldn't at least have an initial preliminary conversation around this. So I'll speak with Director Karums. I'm sorry I said, I said I look forward conversation. I know you do.

The first one is pond stormwater, and I'm glad you said that you're going to meet to discuss that. That is a huge issue in my district. There are two things going on. First of all, I have a lot, and I've spoken with you with us already and we actually have a task force that will be addressing this from a bill that we are, was going to be introduced this week. Will be introduced. I have a lot of ponds in my district, throughout many of my communities, specifically Largo Woodmore, where they're not being managed and it's leading to a smell that is impacting the community and other things that could happen. We do need assistance by Doe to intervene, to help. It is hard for any HoA to manage a pond, especially one that's big. They don't have the infrastructure to do it. And we would like these ponds to be turned over to the county, to the county, for the county to be a part of preparation. My community is willing to do whatever is needed to get that done. So I really would like to hear about that in addition to that, and I just want to tie this in. We also have a lot of erosion going on behind a lot of our homes where there is literally the water is erosion, where the land under the homes is disappearing. I do believe that it's all connected to the ponds and water. And when we have talked, it is my understanding that we have limited funds for some of those houses and it has to be almost immediately. They have to be immediately impacted. The line needs to be under their houses in order for there to be anything done. But I wouldn't like to put my residents under that type of scare. But we do have quite a few communities, and I get calls almost every other month of another community that we're seeing the same thing. Yeah. So, I mean, we have a lot of complexity around the ponds, right? We have ponds that are in our portfolio with ponds that are in the portfolio of DPWT, but then we have ponds that belong to the hoas. And the problem is, of course, the developers were allowed to do things in exchange for the management of those ponds falling on the hoas. And arguably, that structure didn't make a lot of sense. Right. I mean, I don't think any neighborhood commission, very few neighborhood commissions, are going to have the capacity to manage a stormwater pond. Right? To handle the dredging, to handle the ongoing maintenance that is required to have stormwater facilities work. We have a similar problem, frankly, where one of the things that was in our consent decree was disappearing stormwater facilities in people's homes. Right? Like, so if you lived in a home that, you know, was scoped out for a stormwater facility, you bought it. You might not know what the previous stormwater facility was. Right. Like, you have the responsibility for managing stormwater on your own land as a resident. And I mean, you know, I mean, the reality is that everything else that you're managing, it's a lot to manage. We don't have a methodology or a way of taking those pawns into the public inventory. It does not exist. We would need a process by which to do that in an equitable way. We would need funds to do it because we just talked about the challenges with the funds. I understand the challenge. I mean, I agree from a conceptual standpoint that this is not an appropriate role for most hoas. Most communities there does not. They're not going to prioritize it, right? They're going to prioritize the facility that folks go and use, the playground or keeping the parking lot covered or making sure the streets are good and it falls by the wayside, and then it becomes very, very expensive. That's challenge one. Challenge two is around the erosion of land, the problems that people have with flooding or with erosion from both streams that are behind their homes and other water movements. There's a couple different things there. I mean, first we do the stormwater inspection to figure out what's going on. If it is a neighbor who is causing it because they did something, didn't get it permitted by DPI, et cetera. We work with DPI to try to solve that problem. That way there are different tiers of impact, and we have never been able to obtain enough funding to yes, do anything, but the house is at definitive risk from the water. Historically, the way that stormwater was approached was that we ran water to the streams and then the streams took the water to the ocean. Right. Like they took it to the bigger stream and bigger stream all the way to the Potomac or the patuxent. Very rare cases. And then out to the Chesapeake Bay. That's not the way we do it anymore. But there's a lot of streams that have really big problems. I mean, you see us doing stream restoration projects because you can come into a stream that should be like a cute little trickling stream, and it's a 15 foot cut stream. The amount of water and the speed of water that has gone through that stream for years and years and years isn't doable. I would argue that there are problems with our land use standards and with our development standards that I could go down a total rabbit hole on that, allow that to continue to happen when we build upstream again.

Right. Like they took it to the bigger stream and bigger stream all the way to the Potomac or the patuxent. Very rare cases. And then out to the Chesapeake Bay. That's not the way we do it anymore. But there's a lot of streams that have really big problems. I mean, you see us doing stream restoration projects because you can come into a stream that should be like a cute little trickling stream, and it's a 15 foot cut stream. The amount of water and the speed of water that has gone through that stream for years and years and years isn't doable. I would argue that there are problems with our land use standards and with our development standards that I could go down a total rabbit hole on that, allow that to continue to happen when we build upstream again. A lot of things that would happen, that building might happen in your community is going to affect councilmember Fisher's community because she's downstream of that community, a home up here. It makes water go. And so we've got all of those challenges. We would need a mechanism. We have a mechanism for adopting traditional storm drain infrastructure where we can get a storm drain up to code, and then we would adopt it into the county system to maintain it. Right. So we do that with our municipalities. Hoes are a little bit more complicated. Their government structures are different. We do now have this council community, the one that's in OCR that I forget the name of, but the community, the common ownership community. Right. So there's more of a governance structure around it. There's a way of thinking about them universally. But it's a real challenge, and it's a challenge that's not only going to take process and implementation, but also, unfortunately, a really substantial amount of money. And so we would have to look at it from, I think, you know, if you're putting forward a bill to figure it out, figure out how we're going to prioritize it, figure out what would be the responsibilities of the hoas, etcetera. But it's a really tough issue, and I think it's one we're seeing across the country. So we're not unique in this at all. That. Yeah. I mean, it just was a development standard where we allowed that to happen. And now we're 20, 30, 40 years in some cases into these developments, and they just haven't had the expertise or financial capacity to manage these facilities. So we got to figure it out. Well, chair, I would like your assistance on this to work because this at this point is impacting if we don't do something in a couple years. We're talking about downtown Largo, and we have a major pond that is in terrible shape. And I don't know how that fits into the plan of building around it, which would only make it worse. And then for a raging erosion of houses, I frankly would not feel comfortable living in a home where every day I'm nervous about how when the soil under my home would start to disappear. Right. So we have that. So I really would see if we could start putting some money aside to address that. My second question is about the trash pickup. There's a couple things that came up. A couple of those who are, I guess, subcontractors reached out to me, and this was like it came, they said it's still going on where there was an increase of pricing gas. And they said that you all refuse to renegotiate the contract. And some of those are small business owners MBE's that live in my district. And they said they had to take on the cost of increasing gas to do trash pickup. So I wanted to know whether that was addressed or has there been any type of issues with the trash pickup issue of like, the cost of gas and basically renegotiating that part. Also, there was something I saw personally Councilwoman Fisher talked about sort of what you've seen with the trash pickup. I literally saw a trash pickup on my block right in front of my house where it was like, and it was the day they were picking up recycling and it was blowing everywhere. And when I talked to the driver, I said, look, you've got to stop. Because that's the complaint I hear from my community is that they literally are watching trash trucks going in the community and trash is falling off the trucks going out, or they'll pick it up and throw it, and then everything is everywhere. That's a little different. Now, I was told twice that if they see something that is on the corner, they're not allowed to pick it up. They're only allowed to take pictures of it and they were not allowed to pick it up. That was what the driver told me. He said he was not permitted to pick up anything. But I was like, but you are trashing the community while you're picking up trash. You're literally trash flying off your truck, or there's so much trash that there literally is trash everywhere as they're picking it up. One of the things that I wanted to do, just the negotiating of contract and what are we, are we holding them accountable if they are trashing our community while they're picking up? Because to be honest, if the trash truck comes and there's more trash on the street, litter, that is, I hear more about that than just having the bag sitting on the corner. So they are responsible to pick up anything that fell off their truck they are not permitted to pick up. Like if there's a legal dumping that does not belong to a particular residence. Like, you know, if they go into a neighborhood and someone has chosen to dump in that community, we work with DPWT to get that cleaned up. That is not within their contract or within their responsibilities because they don't know it's in there and it, you know, it doesn't fall into OSHA's health and safety standards. But if it falls off their truck, yes, they're absolutely responsible for picking that up. And when that's reported to 311, Mister Richards right here sends someone out to investigate it and we find them.

So absolutely they are held accountable for that. And that performance was taken into account when we were determining, you know, who would get a contract again and how much of the county that they would be able to do. I mean, our primary decision maker was price, but we also looked at performance and you know, there were a few folks who were not working with anymore because of performance. But no, we need folks to report it. And when they do report it, we absolutely hold them accountable because no, we expect them to be real partners. We hold them to be real partners. The contract was just relet and it does have both a gas clause and a CPI clause. We also numerous times renegotiated with the contractors over the past several years to make sure that they were being made whole and that they were able to charge us prices. That allowed them to provide a living wage and have a sustainable company and really be a business that was growing out of the county. So I'm really surprised and disappointed to hear that from folks because I think we've been really fair. We met with them before we let the contract, we made that decision around tipping fees because of their, you know, the things that they expressed to us. We always have an open relationship with our haulers. We always want to hear from them. We always try to make the contract fit their needs. We made some adjustments to how new their trucks needed to be, because we wanted newer trucks in the community to reduce the amount of emissions, to have the most high quality trucks driving through our communities. And we pushed that back a little bit because they were having concerns with how they could purchase them and their own, the timeline of borrowing money based on the contracts and things like that. So I feel like we have a really good relationship with them, and we try to really be partners because we can't do this without them. And in many cases, their businesses wouldn't exist without us. We need to keep moving. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. So quick. I have two more questions, and I'll be done. So I wanted to just go. I would say this. This is probably the elephant in room in a lot of communities. It is in mine. There has been a consistent demand to move back to two day trash pickup. Now, we told people we don't have the funds for it. And I would like to know sort of what the costs were to move to two day trash pickup. If we're not moving to two day trash pickup, which it doesn't seem to be the case, what are we doing to sort of address the concerns that residents have? Because one of the reasons why they're pushing for this is because of the constant litter and trash that they see on the road. And I would even argue, say that when I do see trash pickup, it is a mountain of trash at the corner pickup. So, I mean, recycling, is there anything we can do to sort of calm the concerns of residents? So folks do receive two days of waste services. They receive composting and yard trim pickup on Mondays, which food waste is 48% of the trash that we get into the facility. So that is picking up half of their waste on Monday and then picking up the other half of, you know, the items that cannot be composted or recycled the other day of the week. So folks do receive two days of trash services or waste services. Are they using those services? Are they using compost? And, like, how many people do we have on compost? Because I don't think that we have a lot of people on these programs, which could be part of the problem. Right. So one of our central goals this year is to really work on that communication, on helping folks understand how to do it, how to use it. We've done a lot of communication already, but there's more that needs to be done. And we are ahead of the curve on this, but something that we expect to see be mandated at the state and possibly federal level in the future. So we're going to be ahead of it, and folks are already going to be a part of it. We need to continue with that education. We provide more waste services and have the most advanced waste program in the country. We've been recognized for that. We provide more services per dollar than any other jurisdiction in the country because we have bulky trash, because we have tire pickup, white goods pickup. Now we have scrap recycling. We're going to have electronics pickup. We have household hazardous waste in the community events. We have community cleanup events. There is no scientific basis for a relationship between trash services and litter and illegal dumping. Those are two completely different universes. Lack or existence of trash services. I can provide you hundreds of studies. We studied everything that we can study around, you know, trash and illegal dumping to try to work waste, litter and illegal dumping to try to work on those things, but they are separate.

I think that what we really need to double down on is working with the community to understand what they're using and how we partner with them to use the services that we have better and have more awareness of the services that we have. Okay. And how much are we spending on all of these? I see the Facebook and Instagram posts. How much are we spending on that? And have we had an analysis on return on investment? So we have a couple surveys that we put out every year as to awareness. And, I mean, by and large, you know, we find that a small percentage of residents use government services. Right. I mean, there's a million people with my cell phone number, and I certainly don't get a million cell phone calls. Right. So we know that folks are not using our services as much as we'd like to. We're looking at the best, you know, analyses of how to get to these things. But we'll have surveys and if we're lucky and we really, really work on it, we'll get 4000 respondents. Right. I mean, there's a million people in the county where there's, there's 600,000, you know, households, there's 180,000 that we provide trust services to. Right. I mean, it's just like we're not, we're not getting the response that we would like to have and we're not, we don't have the awareness or, or, you know, just, just. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. And I don't think we have to make our answers shorter. Okay. Quicker. One more question. Is that for the bottle recycling, how much money do we get from that? And how much money do we spend on the other recycling? Because I remember when I reached out to you when we were, there's a, there was a bill in Annapolis, you. There was money that we're making from the bottle and recycling service. I just wanted to get a, how much that is. We can provide you a report on that. Okay. All right. That's good. And also, I would like to follow up with Councilman Danoga's request about the climate action plan. Can you provide us with a list of, like, what we're doing to address that? Because we do have a lot of activists that are saying that we're not doing much of anything. And it was my first time hearing that there was all this money in implementation. Yeah. So I'm going to provide the spreadsheet, and the climate action implementation strategy plan should be issued by the county executive in the near future. Councilmember Oriata, thank you. And thank you for the presentation. One question just to elaborate on. Council member bligue was talking about so I can better understand. I think one of the biggest arguments around why we went from today trash to one day trash was cost. And then, so I can understand. So moving. So we didn't want to go to have the companies out two times a week. But I guess what I'm hearing is we still now do have two days of trash. It's just they're picking up something different. Instead of the trash, regular trash, they're picking up a different type of trash. So I guess I'm just trying to understand what was the cost benefit? Because maybe I'm not understanding. I'm missing something. So there are a number of costs of people, not of disposable people disposing of compostable waste in a trash bag. And it going to the landfill. There's landfill space. There is production of methane, which, you know, has an overall societal cost, I guess. But it's space. It's the weight of, you know, those items that come into, come into the landfill. It is regulatory costs, et cetera. When we take and divert waste appropriately to be composted, we create something that has value. So what happens to people's food crops is that it is made into a product that we can sell to offset those costs. Right. So when we sell Leafgrove gold, we are making money to pay for those receptacles. We are making money to pay for that service. When you produce trash and you put it in a landfill, it's just there forever and it has no economic value. And how many people are using the composting services now? So we are, we have not yet started evaluating that, but that is something that we're going to be working on this year is looking at what percentages we are getting from communities and figuring out, you know, what communities we need to do more outreach in, et cetera. So we have a total tonnage, but we don't have a really good idea of how it's being used directly by folks because we have commercial and industrial coming in at the same time as we have residential. So we are going to start measuring that in this fiscal year, so we'll have a better picture of how the utilization is going and where we need to do a better job of outreach, starting to do more targeted outreach. And this is an assumption because I know there was like a rollout plan, but are we at the space now from a composting perspective, that the trucks go out everywhere with ideas? So, like, if they go out and let's say they go into a neighborhood, they're going by every house and only ten people put out composting. We really need to understand the return of investment because there's a cost to then go around the entire county for pickup, and there's a very low percentage of people ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Local Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "We provide more waste services and have the most advanced waste program in the country.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We have bulky trash, tire pickup, white goods pickup, scrap recycling, electronics pickup, household hazardous waste, and community cleanup events.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There is no scientific basis for a relationship between trash services and litter and illegal dumping.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Partner with the community to use the services better and have more awareness of the services.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Small percentage of residents use government services.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Have analysis on return on investment for social media efforts.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Follow up with the climate action plan.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Activists saying that we're not doing much of anything in terms of climate action.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Cost and benefits of trash services and compostable waste management.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Diversion of waste to composting creates a valuable product and offsets costs.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Evaluating the utilization of composting services and doing more targeted outreach.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Local Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "We provide more waste services and have the most advanced waste program in the country.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We have bulky trash, tire pickup, white goods pickup, scrap recycling, electronics pickup, household hazardous waste, and community cleanup events.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There is no scientific basis for a relationship between trash services and litter and illegal dumping.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Partner with the community to use the services better and have more awareness of the services.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Small percentage of residents use government services.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Have analysis on return on investment for social media efforts.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Follow up with the climate action plan.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Activists saying that we're not doing much of anything in terms of climate action.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Cost and benefits of trash services and compostable waste management.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Diversion of waste to composting creates a valuable product and offsets costs.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Evaluating the utilization of composting services and doing more targeted outreach.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 4238668, "chunk_end_time": 4586914, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3512?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3512?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=4238"}, {"start": 69000, "end": 75000, "text": "from communities and figuring out, you know, what communities we need to do more outreach in, et cetera.

But I think it'd be important for us to be able to understand how the program's operating now, how many people are utilizing it, what's overall cost and what's the benefit, so then we can articulate that to our communities. Especially for me, I'm not sure. Some of my colleagues, I have a mixture between municipalities and the county. All the municipalities have two day trash. All the county residents don't. So a lot of people don't understand. They're not in capital Heights, they're in the county. And I have to explain to them why they don't have the service. And so I think that education and understanding of costs, what's the return, what's the utilization will be helpful for us because I think all the community understands is that they were promised they were going to get it back and they don't have it. Right. And that's completely out of, you know, our control. As council members, I had a question going back to what councilmember Fisher was talking about, just so I can understand this, because I do live in a municipality around the bags and receptacles, like, so if you just had multiple bags sitting out currently with the county contracts, do they pick up the bags outside of the trash or. No, just I can understand that up to two sealed bags outside of the trash are currently picked up under the four items. Do we pick up four bags or still two bags? The haulers. If there's bag trash at the curb on collection day, the haulers require to pick up the trash no matter how many. But there is a counting. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. Can you please come to the. I'm sorry. You need to come to the microphone. Yeah. So that it's. I mean, there are people online, and so it's. It's. People can watch it later. So. I'm sorry. No, no, you're right. You're absolutely right. So what I was saying is the county contractors are required to pick up trash on trash collection day, regardless of how many bags are set outside of the cart. So they're required to clear the curb. However, there is a county code that states that residents shall not place more than one loose bag of trash at the curb next to their cart. Now, that particular county code is not enforced by Doe or by our division, but there is a county code on there. We direct the haulers, and it's in their contract. If there's trash out, they are to remove the trash, because we recognize that it would be a large issue, perhaps, with, you know, trash being left at the curb. Thank you. You're welcome. And then offline, could we get. Are there. I assume because we have the new contract, the penalties and what the penalties are, again, we can have that offline. And then the last question, when we have residents going to the dump to drop things off, do. There was this conversation some residents had about, like, free they is there costs? Are there free days or there's a certain weight that it's free or just I can have understanding. It's free for residents. If they come in a commercial vehicle, then it's not free. Got it. If they come with a trailer full, it's not. Got it. Thank you. The clarification. On Mondays, though, we did not add a day to do composting. We used the day we already had so we didn't have to send the trucks back out to the community another day, because on Mondays, we were already collecting yard trim. So that was why composting and yard trim are in the same container. We have one trip. We did not increase the number of trips by adding the second day of trash collection by food waste without adding a trip. So that was the cost savings. Got it. Thank you. Sure. Ivy, I think I've arrived too late to know what all the other questions have been, so I will just wait to talk to my colleagues later. But thank you for what you're doing. You take your job very seriously and we appreciate that. And yeah, I just wish we could find a way to include the municipalities in the composting program. But that's a discussion for another day. I'm sorry. Councilmember Oriata had one additional question. Hi, Paul. Apologize. Yeah. And we can answer this offline if needed. I just reviewed the chart that you gave us all that kind of broke down each of our districts. And I just noticed that some people had like planning. I just had nothing planning. So I just wanted to do it was just design and completed. And so if we get a breakdown of like the complete section, what years that was, design phases. And then also there was a mistake in the book. They have one noted as district seven, but I believe it's district six. Cause I think I have zero projects in the queue for my district. So. But we can have that conversation offline. Okay, thank you, Soriata. I will be very brief because we have DBWT next, which is another large organization agency landfill gas.

Okay, thank you, Soriata. I will be very brief because we have DBWT next, which is another large organization agency landfill gas. Where are we in terms of the working on that and getting that underway. I know with the methane. So where are we on that? So we are burning it. So it's not going to be the atmosphere. And we have 98.7% efficiency. But we are scoping both projects at once. OCS has scoped out the project to continue to send the gas to the, the corrections facility. We have a cost on that. We have a baseline design on that. We know what the would be. At the same time. We put out an RFI last year to gauge interest in doing a more advanced project where we would be processing the fuel on site into renewable natural gas. We are working on the RFP for that and expect to issue it by the summer. By the summer. Okay. And then we will be able to make a determination on which project we should move forward with. Okay. Please keep us in loop on that. And because that's great interest and great environmental, you know, be very helpful. I just want to reinforce the climate action plan. I know others asked the question just that we have to be moving forward on that. Animal control and yes, North county shelter, that's already been talked about. I'm not going to talk about that. But in terms of staffing for animal services, what can we do to get the staffing to the level where it should be? And I know we're facing a lot of issues there. Yeah, I mean, I think we brought a new leadership. I'm excited about that leadership. I think that it's becoming a better place to work, which will help on retention. And we just have to continue to use our direct hire authority and bring in folks as we can continue to look for folks and find folks that want to take on that position. But I think that the biggest thing now is as we improve how the facility operates and what the work looks like inside the facility because we have worked with OCS to improve the facility, that we will be able to retain folks when we have them. So that is really our goal. It is tough to find animal control officers as well outside of the facility because it is a big job and it is a big county. It's a tough job and the hours suck. And that's part of the compensation study as well. I believe so. But I'm not sure. But I will say that in FY 24 we've added additional positions. The Department of Environment has put a new structure with a director there with a higher level director. But we are seeing like significant, significant improvements. Much more needs to be done. But there have been significant improvements. And as I think was discussed earlier, for this coming year, we're adding a full time veterinarian at the facility. I appreciate that. We just got to keep moving forward on that. And yes, with Mister Dunoga, we should have further conversation about how we can accelerate the north county shelter. I think that will help and whether it's through a nonprofit. You know, there's many different things we need to look at, but I think that will help the overall animal situation in the county. I'm just going to note that 13% attrition. Noting it not. We don't have to discuss it. That's. I'm going to end there because I know we have DPWT and we have bumping up against a 01:00 p.m. gOFP meeting. Mister vice chair, quickly. Thank you Mister chair. I know there was a comment made about the two day trash pickup, but there's an exorbitant amount of cost that is applied to the county for that two day trash pickup. And I do believe that we would be one of the only jurisdictions in the region that would have a two day trash pickup. We really have three day trash pickup with the amount of things we're picking up. Thank you. Okay with that. Thank you for being here. Thank you for answering our questions. We'll have more discussion in the months ahead. Thank you for the work that you're all doing. I didn't get to too much in the stormwater. I really wanted to talk more about stormwater, but we can do that offline? Absolutely. Anytime. And Miss Bligay, if you could also offline, I'm happy to work with you on the thing. I don't know if you've identified for the department the neighborhoods that you're talking about. Okay, great.

You get a little closer to the mic, though. Oh, sorry. Yeah, it's so rare I get to address you all in person, but I'm going to try to speed through this in the interest of time. I will be handling the Department of Public Works and Transportation's budget overview, and we'll just get started. The overall proposed FY 25 budget for DPWNT is roughly 55 million, which is a decrease of 16.9 million, or 23.6% under FY 24 approved budget. The overall budget is composed of four components, general fund grants, stormwater enterprise fund, and the Transportation Services Improvement Special Revenue Fund. As we go down page one, you can see the general fund portion of the budget is approximately 16 million, which is a 5.4 million decrease over FY 24. This is largely based on a decrease in costs based on a higher recovery rate. That's 12 million. Of that proposed grant funding is approximately 13.7 million, which is a $12.4 million decrease, or 47.6% under FY 24 approved. That is due primarily to the removal of the load no bus emission. I'm sorry, that is due to the removal of the low no bus emission grant and Maryland bikeways grant, which between them is almost 12.6 million and is partially offset by a new Maryland Energy Administration open Energy grant. Proposed Stormwater Management Enterprise fund budget is unchanged from FY 24 at roughly 22.7 million, and the Transportation Services Improvement Fund sees an increase of $900,000, or 55.1% over FY 24 and is proposed at 2.5 million. The department reported that it will be anticipating the need for supplemental appropriations, both from grant funds, both for capital and operating. These are support that these are needed for is shown on page two of your report. Moving on to staffing at the bottom of page two, you'll see the overall authorized staffing count for the department, which increases by two positions, one full time and one limited term from 451 to 453 positions. The limited term is an ARPA position that we'll hear about a little bit later and the full time permanent is in the office of Highway Maintenance. Moving on to page three, the department reports 39 general fund vacancies. All table listing all the vacancies was attached to the responses from the department and you should have that available to you for review. Compensation budget for FY 25 is a 4.5% increase of 982,900, coming to a total of about 22.6 million over time. For fiscal 25 is proposed at 661,000. This reflects the information from this year where the projected FY 24 overtime expenditures are almost 900,000, which is 184,000. Over their approved budget, the operating expenses have increased 6.2 million, or 8.6 million above the FY 24 budget. There's a chart showing all of these on page five of the report. General fund capital outlay is roughly 12.2 million, which is a decrease of 525,000, or 4.1% from the prior year. That decrease is largely due to last year's one time purchase of or FY 20 four's one time purchase of two street sweepers. FY 25 capital outlay expenditures are anticipated for the purchase of one additional street sweeper, fixed route vehicles, paratransit equipment replacements, and other vehicles. There is detail on page six on the table of the capital outlay expenditures. The department's presentation really covers their organizational and operational programs in depth, so I'm going to really speed through the next several pages just highlighting the creation of a PGC 311 team to more effectively deal with 311 calls, and I'm sure they'll talk more about that. Something that I thought was interesting is that the department is implementing a career ladder program funded from its general fund travel and training budget. This is to address, I think in part at least, the challenges of retaining good employees who may be due to the lack of apparent upward mobility within their career paths, and they may want to discuss that a little further as well. Did want to note that consistent with last year, there have been supply chain challenges which have delayed delivery on vehicle purchases. As of this year, vehicle delivery times are ranging from twelve to 48 months. There are some other key initiatives which I think are covered in their PowerPoint, so I'm not going to deal with them. But I do want to mention that the big transit transformation initiative rolled out in FY 24. I know there's a slide or two on that that you'll hear about, but that includes basically the transit vision plan, transit forward zero emissions bus program and service changes which began on several routes in November of 23 and have seen favorable results in on time performance. Moving on to the bus, just wanted to note that there continues to be a challenge with revenues for the bus due to fair jumpers. That's not a new thing. It's not unique to the county, but it's one where if you look at the chart on page nine, you'll see that there was a big drop off from FY 22 to FY 23. FY 24 and FY 25 are anticipated to be consistent. Something else that will likely have an impact in the coming fiscal year is the anticipated service reductions of five to 10% across", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Department of Public Works and

It's not unique to the county, but it's one where if you look at the chart on page nine, you'll see that there was a big drop off from FY 22 to FY 23. FY 24 and FY 25 are anticipated to be consistent. Something else that will likely have an impact in the coming fiscal year is the anticipated service reductions of five to 10% across Wamada rail and bus and paratransit services. The department reported that that will place additional demands on their services and they'll have to adapt and deal with that. Taxicab is a quick note. Mass inspection was performed in FY 24, which was passed by 87 taxicab owner operators, and since November 23 the department has resumed full taxicab administration and enforcement, including the associated fees and services. The taxi board continues to be a challenge, getting a quorum to conduct business. That was noted. I would just direct you to the attachments I and J that were distributed to you by email this morning and have been available prior to that for the full list of road resurfacing projects completed in FY 24 and those proposed for FY 25 litter and illegal dumping, which was referenced in the DOE discussion. DPWNT and FY 23 removed approximately 5341 tons of litter and debris in response to 4549 complaints, both of which were substantial increases over FY 22 figures, and the estimated FY 24 and projected FY 25 numbers are expected to be more stable. Let's see. Okay, moving on to the grant fund, real briefly. Grant fund, as mentioned before, is about 17 million, which is a decrease of 15.4 million or 47.5% below. Again, that's largely due to the removal of the big DoT FTA low to no emission bus grant grant fund staffing increases to 19 physicians with the addition of one ARPA position for FY 25. The full time total is three merit employees and 16 limited term grant funded positions. Department reported two grant funded vacancies currently. Stormwater Management Enterprise Fund, as mentioned earlier, remains the same at 22.7 million. As of March 2024, the department reported 31 full time stormwater Management Enterprise fund vacancies, and again, those can be seen on the table referenced earlier. Mister Hamlin, we need to keep moving. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, I'll just. Actually, I'm just going to go to the special revenue fund. I did want to point out that fund, which is comprised of money received from TNS transportation network services like Uber and Lyft, has rebounded. The intake has rebounded since the pandemic, where it kind of cratered and is continuing upward. One other thing to note with that is this is on page 19. The fund balance for that fund has been growing substantially from 2019, where it was 7.8 million. It's estimated at 15.7 million in FY 24, and there's 1.2 million kept in reserve. But again, that balance is growing as these funds continue to come in really quick. Capital budget overview. The total planned expenditure for FY 25 and the CIP is 50.7 million. The program includes or has one deleted project, which is the amphitheater project, which was moved to another county agency, but also has the added FBI headquarters project. There are several projects which have been completed and are still in the program for closeout. Those are listed beginning on page 20. Sorry, I got ahead of myself. And, you know, just the highlights of the CIP program are beginning on page 21 of no Blue Line corridor project, bridge replacement and repairs, bus, mass transit, and metro access, which receives 900,000 from the transportation Services Improvement Special Revenue Fund, and then the usual ones after that. So with that, I apologize for taking so long, but that's all I've got. Thank you, Mister Hamilton. Appreciate it. Let me turn to Director Johnson. Well, good morning, mister chair and members of the committee. So before I get started, I'd just like to introduce a new member of our leadership team. Mister Stacey Smalls, new deputy director, and he'll be in charge of highway maintenance, storm drain management, and engineering and project management. Great. Welcome. Okay, so the department has shown is organized into sort of six offices, as shown on the screen there. And we continue to provide really cutting edge services to our residents with a lot of innovative approaches to longstanding problems. We'd like to sort of just quickly go through those in the, in the presentation that we have here. So for the first time in a long time the department had a snow season. Last year we had seven snow events and our snow season runs through mid December and ends in mid of March. We were extremely satisfied with the performance of the department in terms of how we tackled the snow events. We had nearly 600 county employees working along with contractors. We integrate a digital way of monitoring our performance to ensure that we improve the quality and ensure that all streets are treated appropriately and in a safe manner. Another huge area for us is tied to the 311 system and one of the big accomplishments was in the tree trimming. We had over 6000 legacy requests, many going back as far as seven years. And the department has recently completed all of those. Those are sort of zeroed out and we are beginning to that the Motorola was the old three one one system.

We integrate a digital way of monitoring our performance to ensure that we improve the quality and ensure that all streets are treated appropriately and in a safe manner. Another huge area for us is tied to the 311 system and one of the big accomplishments was in the tree trimming. We had over 6000 legacy requests, many going back as far as seven years. And the department has recently completed all of those. Those are sort of zeroed out and we are beginning to that the Motorola was the old three one one system. We now have the salesforce system which is new. And we are sort of cutting through the backlog in that our goal is really to remove the backlog so that we can move to sort of a proactive posture and a maintenance posture which is what our department is really set up to do. So here this shows as we look at the entire PGC 311. Two years ago, roughly when I joined the department, we had nearly 20,000 backlogged items. And through diligent work by an entire team led largely by deputy director Olusche Olabanley, you can see the progress that was made in a very short period of time. So our backlog is roughly somewhere around 5000 items and we're sort of working to get that eliminated. Our goal, as I mentioned, is to not really have a backlog so that we can proactively address complaints that come in to the department. Another huge area that is new for us, Prince George's county has not really had a comprehensive street sweeping program in residential areas. We did. The department did sweep collectors and arterials, some industrial areas, some residential areas, selective areas. We are in the process of rolling out comprehensive residential street sweeping and we thank you for the sweepers that were budgeted for last year. And we put in another sweeper for this year to give us some redundancy in the program. But this is a huge program that will be broken out into two phases. Phase one will be rolled out this summer and we'll be sweeping about a little over 700 curb miles every five weeks. And phase two we'll be up to nearly 1600 kermiles and that will be covered by a fleet of five machines and they'll be swept like every five weeks. Now, to put it in some context, Montgomery county sweeps for three months a year, and they sweep about 4100 curb miles. We'll be sweeping nearly 5000 every three months, and we will be sweeping for 28 weeks. So we'll be providing a far greater, a more robust approach to it. This came out of the initiative that was started in November of 2022, and the county executive directed us to improve the litter in the county. And in going through the blitz, as it was called at the time, we discovered that the, we had one sweeper at the time, that one sweeper picked up nearly 300 tons of litter. So that really told us something that really, that there's a lot of residual litter that's in the gutter pans, as you can see in the slide, that really a human being cannot collect. It's really better suited for a machine to collect. So we are really optimistic that this will improve the overall cleanliness of our streets and the concomitant improvements to the Chesapeake Bay as stormwater runs eventually to the bay. That would probably help our TMTL as well, the total maximum daily load on the waterways. It does because the sweepers that we are acquiring are called regenerative air sweepers now, they're different from vacuums or brooms. Those sweepers have the ability to pick up nitrogen and phosphorus in addition to litter. So that definitely will reduce TMDL loads of those pollutants. Residual salt will always be, will also be picked up and ultimately all the water flows to the bay. And this will sort of be very beneficial to that. We're taking a different approach also in the way in which we are approaching streets now, this graphic shows broken down by councilmatic district, the roadway conditions within equity emphasis areas within each district. Now, just to step back slightly, what we did, the county in 2018 began to sort of use the PCI pavement condition index measure to have an objective way to determine what conditions of roads are in the county. We have nearly 40,000 streets in the county, more than 2000 miles of roads, and for the first time in about ten years, we reassessed the entire county network. And our network average is somewhere around 62 out of 100. We would like to improve that number significantly, but we want to sort of take a more strategic approach to how we do this. As you can see on this and in the subsequent slides, districts do not have the same number of miles of roads. And equity emphasis is also something that we would like to focus on. If you take district two, you will see that most of this, most of that district has roads below PCI 55 that are in equity emphasis, but district four does not, and district nine has less. Right. So we want to sort of weight the approach in which we are paving our roads to incorporate that into it so that we are more, a little fairer in how we are sort of dealing with our communities. I'm sorry. Going the wrong way. Okay. Oh, did you want to see that? Okay. Yes. So district nine has a quarter of the streets. We're just concerned with the miles. Right. But you can see that the PCI, if you look at the pcis here, that the pcis are pretty high in some of the districts. District one has the lowest. And, you know, that would sort of indicate that we probably should be doing some more work in the district to bring things up.

And, you know, that would sort of indicate that we probably should be doing some more work in the district to bring things up. Our goal is really to improve our overall PCI, to bring it closer to, you know, mid sixties, which we feel is a fairer number. Another great initiative that we, that we're working on is the sidewalk trip hazard mitigation program. Now, many of the older communities were built at times when, before arborists were involved, when trees were planted. So they tended to plant the wrong tree in the wrong place. So one of our most successful programs is called right tree, right place. And what it attempts to do is to correct that legacy problem by making sure that we're planting the right tree in the right width of planting space. However, these problems remain. And in many of the older communities, you find that the sidewalks are sort of not level. There are geometric defects. They may not be structural defects in that they can't really carry the weight, but they do make it difficult to sort of traverse, ride a bike on, walk on, things of that nature. So we started a program on a pilot basis. We have 19 locations in which 16 have been done. We started this last November, and since last November, we have eliminated nearly 15,000 trip hazards from sidewalks using this approach. And what this does is that it removes the portion of the sidewalk that is posing a trip hazard. That works because the sidewalk is about four inches thick, and we're removing like a fraction of an inch, like, you know, trip. You can trip on like a quarter of an inch, something like that. So we level it off so that the sidewalk is sort of passable once again. And we've had very, we're very pleased with that pilot and plan to sort of expand that integrated into our program going forward into our operations going forward. Another big issue, a big initiative that we're working on is dealing with sidewalks once again. And we want to sort of use data. We always use data to try to drive the operations of the department. So what we are currently doing is we are going to, for the first time, collect condition data for the sidewalks in Prince George's county. It is not known, other than a very rough estimate, the entire mileage of sidewalk that is available, that's present in the county. But we will know this later this year. Not only will we know the mileage, not only will we know the missing areas where sidewalks should be, not only will we know whether our ADA ramps are conforming to the ADA standard, but we will also have a condition rating for the sidewalks, which will then allow us to move to a programmatic approach to addressing it with these types of large initiatives. Unless you can turn it into a program, you're often going to spend a lot of money with, not with very uneven sort of results. And we are very confident that coming out of this exercise, we will be able to sort of have a sidewalk program which can be funded, costed, funded, and scheduled. And then that will allow us to sort of have an accountable way of delivering that particular improvement. One of the we're not only doing great work in the infrastructure side, but we also are very concerned with our workforce development. And we have in the office of Administrative Services, headed by associate director Ebony Gatewood Crenshaw, we have begun a, we spun up a workforce development unit. And one of the large initiatives that we're working on is what we're calling our career ladder now within, to give some context within the DPW, and this is common in dpws, it's not particular to ours. Staff often do not have a clear picture as to how they progress in their careers. And this has collateral effects, negative effects, in that it affects morale, it affects the ability to sort of upskill staff staff and retain and attract staff. So our program is a comprehensive program that will correct those deficiencies. And it's being done not in the director's office, where I'm sitting in my office and sort of creating this. We have integrated staff from all levels throughout the organization to help us put this together, and we are, I think we're doing terrific work on this. I really am pleased and excited, as are members of staff with, you know, what we will produce coming out of this, which will be beneficial to the department today and for years to come. So I'll ask oluse to talk about trends. All right, I think it's good afternoon now. All right, good afternoon. I'll keep it quick, but we're excited to move forward. I think we still need the presentation up, but we're excited to move forward on our transit initiatives. We launched Prince George's county transit transformation in October of last year, and we're continuing with the four efforts. I'll just keep talking. Okay. All right. One of those initiatives is our transit vision plan, which is a five year plan that looks at really changing the transit network. We've worked with and partnered with Wamada to analyze all of the transit deserts or gaps in access and accessibility throughout the county. And so we're going to be pushing that forward.

So I'll ask oluse to talk about trends. All right, I think it's good afternoon now. All right, good afternoon. I'll keep it quick, but we're excited to move forward. I think we still need the presentation up, but we're excited to move forward on our transit initiatives. We launched Prince George's county transit transformation in October of last year, and we're continuing with the four efforts. I'll just keep talking. Okay. All right. One of those initiatives is our transit vision plan, which is a five year plan that looks at really changing the transit network. We've worked with and partnered with Wamada to analyze all of the transit deserts or gaps in access and accessibility throughout the county. And so we're going to be pushing that forward. Our zero emissions bus, where we're trying to transition and actively and aggressively transitioning our fleet to zero emissions. I'll go into some detail there. Transit forward looks at really the quality of our service, really improving our customer experience and improving our reliability and efficiency of service, and then our service changes, which. There are a couple of new service changes happening this spring. And on June 3, we will be introducing. Drumroll, please. Really exciting. Two new routes, one from Greenbelt to Laurel. Using our travel demands analysis and in partnership again with Wamada through their better bus network, we identified areas throughout the county that lacked transit service. So Greenbelt to Laurel was one of them. And we'll be actually going, this line will go through the Laurel Regional Hospital and a couple of senior centers as well. The second route is the route 29, which will go from Largo to Landover. So these two new routes is just the beginning of what we hope to expand over the five year period. We did a couple of route adjustments and we'll be introducing microtransit, which is an on demand service. Some routes in areas in the county does not warrant fixed route service. But similar to how we all have gotten accustomed to the Uber and the lifts, micro transit allows the opportunity for on demand service. So where transit service is needed. So we're looking at three zones, and according to the data that we pulled post Covid, we're looking at expanding in the Bowie, Clinton and Laurel area. As I mentioned earlier, our transit vision plan, an extensive amount of outreach and stakeholder engagement. We have since the beginning of fall of last year into now, this spring and summer, over 15 events we've talked to, community meeting, we've been at community meetings, pop ups, going to high ridership routes, having webinars, partnering with Wamada, going to senior centers, municipalities, etcetera. To really get the word out about the transit vision plan, we hope to release late spring, early summer, some of the spring service changes that I had mentioned earlier, the addition of the two routes there are, you know, some cervix extensions as well, that we're pretty happy to announce as well. The route 30 will begin to. We'll have stops at the Iverson Mall and Suitland metro station, the route 36 extending to Branch Avenue. So these are just the beginnings of what we're seeing, and we're seeing progress. We did a fall service change. The county hasn't had a major service change in a while, so in the fall, we made a lot of adjustments. Have we seen that improvement? Actually, let me go back up. We've seen that improvement in on time performance where system wide, we're at about 73%. Our goal by the end of fiscal year 24 is 75%. We know that best practice is to be at least 80, so we're making progress there. And then our zero emissions bus transition. I want to thank chair Ivey for your support in really getting the letter out. The support letter out. We're actively going for grants we're going to be applying for, which is due today. The team is working hard on that to get that submitted today. But we're going to be submitting a nearly $40 million grant to complete. To complete phase two of our microgrid. And this is more on the construction side. Phase one was more the design, which would be able to charge up to nearly 80 buses at the same time. And so we're happy about that. You know, our $40 million proud to charge initiative, which was last year, was really our largest grant since then. So we're hoping to match that next year. So, again, our goal is to be at 70%. By 2035, if we do win this grant, we'll have about 50. We'll be about 50% of our fleet at zero emissions bus. So we're excited to move forward on those initiatives. Okay, thank you. Thank you. So we continue to focus, and I'll just go through the rest of this fairly quickly, continue to focus on safety. As everyone is concerned, is aware, Prince George's county has many streets that are sort of fairly dangerous while they are state roads. While the majority are state roads. We do have a few that are county roads, and we are working assiduously to improve that and sort of get to zero deaths. So we were successful in getting a grant to make safety improvements to seven of those. From USDOT, we have a reconstituted vision zero team, pardon me, that uses data to sort of find ways to integrate engineering, as well as some of the other features into roadway safety. The goal being to shift from the traditional six es to a safe system approach, which is the current metamorphosis of, you know, the thinking on roadway safety. Let's go into the capital program quickly. So the capital deals with, we have, like, storm drain and culvert repairs, bridge repairs, intersection traffic signals, roadway safety, sidewalk and pedestrian, as well as project planning. And these are some of our accomplishments for the past fiscal year. So we resurfaced 12 miles of roads by contractors.

And these are some of our accomplishments for the past fiscal year. So we resurfaced 12 miles of roads by contractors. And you can see the other stats that are there, but you can see the team is extremely busy doing a lot of work. That really makes a big difference in terms of roadway condition and overall safety. So some of our traffic safety accomplishments of the last year was Richie Marlborough Road from Brook Lane to Marlborough Point Drive. That road was a sort of a wide cartwhee with an aspirational medium media. It had been painted. So, you know, so it was very dependent on the driver not doing something that, you know, was a bit reckless. That tended to be the practice, and that road had a lot of accidents. So what we did was we reduced the travel lane to. To two lanes in each direction, and a median has been put in. We also installed a signal at Brook Lane, which sort of has helped to sort of meter the traffic, particularly going into the school in that vicinity there. We also did installed rrfbs along Adelphi Road. And that's the rectangular rapid flashing beacon. And that is often installed in locations where we cannot get the warrants for a traffic signal. It's not appropriate to use a signal. That is really not something that the department controls, but it is a federal and a state requirement as to when signals or other traffic control devices can be installed. We did also a very nice pedestrian safety improvement on good luck Road near the Dianet center. That was a very wide cartwheel, which had had a fatality. Lots of other injuries from conflicts with pedestrians, with vehicles. Median was installed. RFB was put in a wider and more visible crosswalk. And I think it is performing quite well from the feedback that I'm getting. We also installed sidewalk along old Crane highway in upper Marlboro. And, you know, the residents there were extremely ecstatic because they can now sort of walk safely, you know, to use that street. We also are working on doing a lot of work on our bridge program. Here is on the left. It shows before that it was a pre stress box beam bridge. You had some delamination of the box, which means that it's losing strength and it was a safety concern. This is the replacement structure that is being installed on the right, and they are actually ahead of schedule, I'm told by the engineering team. That's working on that here. This is Chilham Road, which was another very wide cartwheel that had had some pedestrian issues, conflicts with vehicles. A mini roundabout was installed there, narrowing of lanes wider and more visible, striping for crossing crosswalks. And it's an overall safety improvement to that particular intersection which had been very problematic for a long time. We continue to do great work on the stormwater restoration, flood control. These are a list of the future projects that the department will be working on, that office will be working on. We are close to completing our obligations under the consent decree and director crooms did mention that we'd be out of that fairly soon. And this sort of shows, you know, what is our portion that is remaining. So we are ahead of schedule and we are very pleased with the performance in this area. Pond maintenance. We have 900 ponds facilities that we are responsible for. This gives information on the mowing, the required triennial inspections every three years it must be inspected, as well as information on sort of the pipes and, you know, risers and other things like that that need to be replaced periodically. The right tree, right placed. We receive a grant from the Chesapeake Trust, the trust for that, for planting trees. And you know, there's a tremendous. We planted about 7000 trees which are sort of native to the area, which is the right way to sort of ensure that you don't have problems in the future. Another innovative idea that we use is that we have, in looking at our gis, we have more than 200 medians countywide and many of the medians serve a utilitarian purpose. They separate traffic going in opposite directions. There's an opportunity we saw to sort of beautify those medians and as part of place gathering and beautifying areas. So we did a pilot on that and I think it's been very successful here you can see one exemplar of what it looked like before and after. And we are. We're really pleased. And you know, as funding dictates, we plan to expand it. And this is our budget, which was sort of went over, and our grants and I think that's it. We will be. That's it. Thank you. Appreciate it. I know we're bumping up against the next committee in about a half an hour, but let me go to vice chair Harrison and then to councilmember Fisher, and then we'll turn. Thank you, mister chair.

First and foremost, I want to thank the Department of Public Works and Transportation, all the staff, all the professional hardworking individuals in your agency for what you all do. Each and every day, anytime you're dealing with road infrastructure, it's not easy. My first question is, and I didn't see it in your presentation, but just for context for the public, that it might be watching pre pandemic costs and where we are today, especially when it comes to asphalt and road repair, I've heard, and I don't know how true this is. So that's why I'm asking you, that the cost has gone up three to four times than what it was before the pandemic. Do you have any information about the cost of asphalt, how that has kind of been, might have been challenging for the route, the amount of miles that we're trying to pave? Yes, Councilman. So I don't think the markup has been as high as three times because it's really driven a lot by the price of oil. So when you have, like if you have conflict in the gulf or something that causes over Russia and something that causes oil prices to rise, you will, you will have a concomitant rise in the asphalt price. However, it does cost us about three quarters of a million dollars a mile to pave roads. So that's, it's not a cheap approach. So the way that we are sort of approaching this is that the traditional way the department had looked at this is that we paved, we milled two inches, and then we repaved two inches. So two off, two on. We, in discussing it with, you know, internally with our engineering staff, we feel that there is a different way in which we could approach this, in that for this reason, that all roads are not the same. Richie Marlborough Road, which carries a very high volume of traffic and is a collector or type of a road, arterial type road, is not the same as a residential road, which carries a very low volume of traffic. So we are using, exploring alternative ways of paving roads which provide adequate life strength and prevent water from getting into the base of the road, because that's really what kills a road when you have an ability for water to enter, and then in the winter it freezes and you get freeze and thaw, and it sort of breaks the road up, you get potholes, degradation of the road. So by using alternative ways with different costs, we are within the budgetary constraints that we have going to be able to do more paving than we actually do. Just doing too often too on. So as you mentioned, roads are expensive to build, right, and to maintain, but you don't have to have one cost, one way of tackling the improvements. Thank you, director. And the reason why I was bringing that up. If I know in the past that we used to invest, I think it was about. My numbers could be skewed, but 35, 36 million in past budgets. And this year. My question for you, mister early, where we stand about roadway improvements when it comes to the districts, well, we had. We'd actually have 25 million, but then last year we went to 36. Yeah. And that was partly because we were going to have a dish, we anticipated, to getting additional federal money, which we did not get. And so what we are trying to do now is simply maintain the level of county supported, county supported road and curved work that we had committed to. So that's about, what, 3.1 million per district? If we broke it up. If you broke it up that way. Okay. All right. And the reason why I'm saying that, you know, with a 25% budget reduction and then you said it was a 47% grant funding, is that what I heard? Decrease. I heard the word decrease in your. Your grant funding projection. Huh? I just want to make sure I heard that right and maybe I heard it wrong. No, you heard it correctly. However, the grant funding that was not actualized was on the operating side and not the cip side. Okay. And the reason why I'm saying that those grants have helped, especially in my district, with bridge repair on Mollyberry, which is a 660 year old bridge that was concrete and then had wood underneath. The wood was gone. So, yeah, I think our grants. Just the importance of our grant funding is important. So $40 million to upgrade your energy kind of mission that you're trying to do there is very, very, very important. You know, the funding sources are not the same. Like for the bridge program, it's largely federally funded. A lot of our bridges are federally funded and they're driven by the structure condition, structural condition. And we've been extremely successful in terms of not only winning grants for that and then winning awards once the bridge has been done. So we are, you know, our bridge program is very robust, very well funded, and, you know, we're pleased with that. So in my last question real fast, you have about, you used to have 288 operational staffing, now you're going to 289. One additional position, is that correct? Funded from the general. Funded from the general fund, yeah. Mister early, my question is after this person is hired, is we heard about 800 positions that are hiring freeze across our county agencies. Is this one of the agencies where there is a hiring freeze on? Yes. Okay. There you go. I'm good. Okay. Councilmember Fisher. Thank you, mister chair. I know we're being.

I was curious about what you're doing to retrofit that. And I copied a contact at the school system because they also have electric charging with the buses. And I wanted us to do something that was together and made sense rather than, you know, separate. I don't even know if that works. But that was my question.

Can you hear me? Can't hear you. Tomorrow I am unmuted. There you go. Yep, go ahead. Couple questions, mister director. I wrote to you about a week ago about Rhode Island Avenue. This is an issue in college park where we have people walking in the road. It's been going on for years. People complain. And the Department of Public Works, when we asked about putting in sidewalks, said they were going to come up with a design back in 21. Last communication was in the summer of 22, I believe with the statement that the concept would be finished by the end of 22. When I wrote you last week, it seems like nothing's been done. If we're talking about sidewalks, we're talking about pedestrian safety. I don't understand what's going on with the Rhode Island Avenue section outside the city limits, up the sunny side, in sort of speaking with the engineering staff to understand what had transpired. They relate to me that the scope, the initial scoping of the project was expanded significantly over what was presented in, or, you know, the earlier years. So as a consequence, the project is significantly larger and requires a greater engineering effort to deliver it. And that really is the explanation for why there has been this delay in terms of getting it moving. However, they are working on that. And you know, the. Once we have a clearer picture, I don't have the exact timeline right now because it is still. The scope is, the scoping is not finalized yet, or is more or less in that stage where we are not able to give a very concrete completion date for the delivery date for it. But once we have that, we will be able to relay that. I hear, I hear you, but this is four years. It's literally been four years, and it is a very dangerous stretch. We have people walking in the road. I'm sure there's plenty of places around the county. The only point I would make is this has been four years. I've only identified one location where I'm concerned about this in my district, although I'm sure there are many more. And the city, college park and the residents in the area asked the question, well, can't we just put down a sidewalk? And of course, the answer from DPW is, it's not that simple. There's stormwater management, you know, et cetera. But, you know, in the sake of getting it done right, we're not getting it done at all, and we don't. This came up a week or two ago because the congressman Hoyer and Congressman Ivy are looking to spend money on local projects like this, and we didn't have anything to give them. Now, I understand the frustration that this poses, but I think that was the answer. And I understood clearly what they were saying. If the scope was different from what was presented in 22, you couldn't really. You don't really have a fundable project as such where you could put it in for. You're unlikely to prevail in getting any money because your scope is. Is not developed enough to make it fundable. And that really is something that has become a priority for them to finalize that and move it forward through the delivery chain. But it's not something that is ready for that at this point. Largely because of things you've mentioned, there are complex stormwater issues, there's acquisition issues, right of way issues, and other things that sort of delay the project with these types of projects, unfortunately, a lot of the time is spent in the prep work. The actual construction of a sidewalk or a roadway is actually de minimis in time, in the time it takes to do that. Compared to the permitting and the regulatory compliance piece, that really is important. The project can move forward without that. It can be funded without that. So they're working on that currently. Okay. My last connection with GPW was summer, fall of 22. It's almost two years and nobody got back to me, and it slipped off my radar. So I hope I'll get something sooner than later in terms of communications. Just an update as we move forward. You don't need to answer that. I'll just leave that. And because I know we're short on time, I did want to ask you, there's apparently state legislation that is now authorizing stop sign enforcement cameras.

Is DPWT gonna have, I would assume, have a role in that? Or is it this police, a multi jurisdictional, how, how are we looking at this? I think with any form of enforcement the correct agency is, is the police department more than DPWT? We would have, I would call it apocryphal reports whereby people would complain, you know, they would call and say this intersection is, people are blowing through the stop sign. We can provide and, you know, the information that we got we receive in that manner. But really the police districts or the police department are the ones who issue citations and have the best information to provide this sort of enforcement related information. And it would be, it has to be a police program. We have no police powers that allow us to be involved in inciting people or placing cameras or anything of that nature. But we can, I hear you. I don't disagree. I'm just trying to figure out does the administration have a strategy around this? Were you blindsided by this information or is this something you knew was coming? And we have a plan that's implemented with the police and DPW working together. We're thinking it would seem to be something that the, that possibly an amendment to an existing committee, CAC seems to be set up to sort of deal with these sorts of issues and they probably could, that probably could be assigned to them and that's a police department committee large, that's run by them. It would seem to be they might be the better agency to sort of deal with this as they know really the details of these interactions far better than we do. Johnson, Mister early has something to add to this and then I know we need to move on to the next item. It probably would involve police, DPWT and the revenue authority, all of which we'll have to have some discussion and we'll have to. And we'll, you know, there has to be a review of how to approach this and we are looking at that. But at this point we don't have a fully developed plan. I recommend you schedule a future tie discussion on this. Yeah, Mister Battle is here making notes, so. Sounds good. Question about the new equity emphasis data approach. Since I joined the council 22 years ago, we've always, as a council advocated for more money, for road repaving. And back then it was pushing it to get to 18 to 20 million. The last number of years we've had it in the low 30 million s. And every year we supposedly divided it nine ways across districts. Am I hearing you say that you're redistributing the money or the distribution is going to be done in a different way and different districts will get different levels of funding. It is possible, as we begin, we're beginning to look at this and it's possible that, but it may not be a strict like nine divided into money divided into nine, because all the roads, as you see, if you go back to the chart, if you look at that chart, like some of the districts have fairly high pcis. Our goal really is to improve the network performance of the county roads. So we have to sort of maybe look at it a little more strategically than just dividing it across in that equal kind of a fashion. I don't think we'll have the punch that doing it that way than if we sort of like spent money on roads that may be in greater need of treatment in respective districts or portions of districts. I would argue this, if you're going to change the way you decide to use those funds, that the council understand the formula that you're using. I mean, these charts are nice, but they don't tell us what the consequences in my district is. On these charts is an interesting case study. There's a lot of blue, but when you get down to the summary statistics page, I have the lowest PCI. So what does that mean? I've got more blue than two or three districts, but I've got the worst rating of every district. So what does that translate into? District four, but it's all blue, it's 100% blue and they have a very high PCI. So they're getting no money. Because keep in mind, if we're talking was it 25 million divided by or 27 million divided by nine, we're only getting two to 3 million a district if we divide it equally, if we adjust that, you're talking something less than two to 3 million for some districts, you can't pay very many road sections on a million dollars, so there's equity. That goes a couple different ways. I think we need to understand the formula that you're going to use. Something that we're developing. Councilman, we're not in a position to answer that yet, but we will have that developed okay. In the near future. Thank you, Mister Johnson. We'll look at that. Mister. Where's Mister Burroughs? All right, Miss Bligue, please, quickly. I'm so sorry. I mean, I will be as quick as I can now. Send follow up emails. I will be honest.

Road infrastructure is the biggest issue in my district and I brought that to you before. I just want to start with a couple things. First of all, I want to know, I had a traffic common committee. I probably wouldn't even run here if I didn't have a traffic comment committee, that nobody from Europe agency showed up, not one person. And I just want to note that many of the things that I brought to your attention, you've seen that when you came to my office last year, I brought to you the Richie Marlborough situation because we had people in my district coming to me saying that there needed to be something done. Literally two weeks later that girl was killed. And I just want to note that. I know I can be annoying about this, but the reality is that it's because it's a big issue. We had it a whole town hall. Westphalia. The biggest issue was that Westphalia and DRC wrote someone will die if we don't have something done in Westphalia. Westphalia has a lot of road infrastructure issues. So I just want to ask, I did send you a list a couple after the traffic calming of about 20 roads that needed upgrades. I did want to know what is the process? Are you all putting more money into just upgrading some of the roads throughout the county? I mean, specifically talking about my district. I do see this list here, but we have a number of places that need immediate attention. So, councilman, the way in which roads are, the department does not take a road and sort of improve the, they put in medians and other sidewalks and things of that. That's not the way that the roads are dealt with. A lot of those improvements are tied to developments that the developer, by the county code, is required to make frontage improvements off roads. So if you have a developer, a, who is building, you know, a development on a particular parcel, but by the permit that they receive from DPI, part and parse of that permit requires them to make pre agreed upon improvements to the frontage. That's the way the county codes. I know, but that's backwards because the problem is people are building off of roads that are not upgraded overall for the traffic that's to come. So they're building and what we're doing is putting the cart before the horse because by the time they build that, they only are required to do frontage. You're right, but that doesn't mean they have to do the expansion. So what's failure? Road is going to have thousands of people moving on it in the next five years because of all the development. And all we're focused on is frontage from the developer. So what about the actual road itself? So I'm sorry if, if there are, if there are existing conditions that are dangerous, DBWT can can look into those and address. That's not what he said. What he's saying is that that's the developer is going to build. But what I'm saying is that let's get ahead of the game. If we already know that there are pending development that's coming to somewhere like westbound, why don't we expect council member or trying to upgrade Westphalia Road. Council member bligue, I'm asking him to address that. Okay. Yeah. So the answer if something is dangerous, if we do have an identified dangerous condition that would then become a cip that we would make improvements to. But what we are not able with 2000 on one more than 2000 miles of roads, it's not something that really, and the cost that I sort of mentioned, that's not a strategy, a financial strategy that the department is funded for or capable of doing. Our budgets would never accommodate what you are describing where you could take a road and say we're going to just add whatever some speculative improvement that is not tied to a development that probably wouldn't even wise Director Johnson. So this is a specific example and I think it is very important that we look at that. But there are also, you had examples that you showed in this presentation of, you know, reducing from two lanes to one lane. You have some other improvements like that. I mean clearly there's a program that you're doing some of these spots. I'm not saying like you're going to do everything all at once, but maybe we can talk about that more offline. I know we have several, we have like ten minutes for everybody else. I understand and here's what I would say. We're doing sector plans everywhere and it makes no sense to me that we're putting together sector plans and streets in this sector plan are not lined up for any type of upgrades from DPWT until something happens. So Richie Marborough, something happened, so now we did it. But the reality is that some of these were already, the point of putting sector plans and all of these together is so that they can be upgrades on roads, anticipation of what's coming. We're not doing that. So now I've got my community screaming at me every week. Literally, I mean I say you all doing upgrades, literally every day we get multiple emails about road infrastructure issues all up and down all throughout district six. So I would like to work with you 2nd, 2nd part. I'm sorry this is so much vision zero is my understanding. Can you explain what the money for Vision Zero is doing?

Because to me the best way to stop any type of fatalities on road is upgrading these streets, putting sidewalks on the street, putting actual traffic lights. That's the way you stop it. Any other thing to tell people, hey, don't cross the street when the car is not coming, that's not going to stop people from getting killed. So I just want to know what is vision zero doing and can we take that vision zero money and start to upgrade some of these streets, put some sidewalks on the roads? We are, you know, sidewalks, we are doing that. Sidewalks are part of it. Vision. The traffic safety or roadway safety is not just one thing. It's not just like if you put sidewalks in that that in and of itself would stop people from speeding, running, you know, traffic control devices or other kinds of behaviors that contribute to making roadways dangerous. What we do, what the Vision zero, just very quickly, I know we're short of time. What the Vision Zero program is doing is that it is taking a set of data from different sources, including we are recently adding near misses locations that have had near misses. And then based on that data, you are able to then develop a plan as to what is needed because you will find that road as what you need to do to road a to make it safe is not what you need to do to road x. It is not like a cookie cutter, as you can say you do. If I do these five things, the road will be safe. It has to be specific to the road. So division zero Pro and I could be glad to sort of talk more. I know we don't have a lot of time right now to go into that. Mister early wanted to. I just want to make a quick comment that there are structures like road clubs that are set up for developers to pay into when these. When roads are being. When roads are being. Developments are being created around major roads that set up funds to address some of the issues you're discussing. And I think at some other point we'll have to have. We can have additional discussion about that. Yeah, we're obviously going to have to have more discussion around all of this, but one more question. Does the transportation, the money that a developer pays into for transportation upgrades, does that go into a separate fund or does that go into the general fund? Mister early? It does not go into. It goes into a pool for transportation projects. It's not part of the general operating. Okay, so it's a separate. It's a separate fund. That is. Okay. So I just want to make sure, because when I met with park and planning, we were told something. We saw that it went to some sort of general fund. So, meaning that anybody who has a project and they paid their payment, it goes straight into just that upgrade for that particular road and nowhere else. Right. It goes into a pool for the roads. That's a fairly complex discussion about whether it's for that road or for a set of roads and so forth. But it's for roads. Okay, well, I will stop. I would say this. I really hope that I start getting responses directly from you all. And if we get responses or get to work together, I wouldn't have to run to a committee to get your attention, Mister Burrows. Thank you, mister chairman. I had a question around the capital bike share locations. It was brought to my attention pretty recently that there are over 20 new capital bike share locations being added to the northern part of the county, and we're not seeing that same level in the southern part of the county. Can I get some explanation on that? I think the capital bike share, one of the criteria that had been used was density, which sort of translates, is sort of related to demand. In a sense, it's kind of related demand. So in the southern part of the county, I think in the way that it was being looked at, that might be the explanation as to why it was skewed in that fashion. I think a lot of decisions from the Olsen Brooks administration has been skewed towards the north, frankly. And maybe one of the bases is density. But we are paying taxes too, in the southern part of the county. And the reason why I'm raising this is because residents of mine in Fort Washington desperately want these capital bike share locations. And while we don't have the density of the northwestern part of the county, you know, we are also tax paying citizens that matter, and we should be treated equitably. And that does not appear to be the case. So what needs to happen for us to get some geographical equity? So I'm sorry not to. I do see in our memo from Mister Hamlin, the bike share initiative, that there's a feasibility study going on that would add to that. But I don't know where this is. Yeah, it's a study. So we have to sort of. I was just explaining what, what had been the metric that was used to help decide where these facilities should have been placed. But a study is being done to sort of reassess to see how it could be more equitable to your. The point that you're making. Thank you. Please communicate that with us.

I do see in our memo from Mister Hamlin, the bike share initiative, that there's a feasibility study going on that would add to that. But I don't know where this is. Yeah, it's a study. So we have to sort of. I was just explaining what, what had been the metric that was used to help decide where these facilities should have been placed. But a study is being done to sort of reassess to see how it could be more equitable to your. The point that you're making. Thank you. Please communicate that with us. I look forward to working with you. There's a group that is in contact with our chair and that's in my district for Washington forward that has sent a list of possible locations. We want to work collaboratively, but we want our due representation. And when we look at schools, community centers, libraries, bike lanes, it's all been skewed to the north, as if the folks in the southern part of the county don't matter, as if we don't pay taxes. And so a part of your metric should be, be. And I guess maybe this is for the liaison at the end, should be geographical diversity. Are you the liaison? Oh, you're not the liaison. Step out for a few minutes. Okay. Geographical diversity has to be a part of the equation, but I thank you for your work. Yeah. So hopefully we can continue the conversation about the bike share and, you know, future locations, because I note that there is feasibility. Miss Orriado, thank you. Thank you for the presentation. Similar to council member Danoga, just. And we can do this offline, but just want a better understanding of the chart, what this means, what that's going to look like for forward programming, because just like looking at it, I don't really understand. Right. Like, how we collect the data. What does it mean? Making sure that we dive into this and have an understanding, hopefully before this is used as like, the decision matrix moving forward. So I did have a couple of questions, one for the sidewalk program, and I think it was 60 plus, maybe sidewalks that had been done. Is there like a dashboard and a way we can see, like, what communities, like broken down by district where we've seen those repairs. We don't have a dashboard developed, but the listing is in the presentation. Oh, sorry, not sidewalks. I meant to say speed bumps. Oh, speed humps. Yeah. Okay. We could provide that information. I mean, we don't have a dashboard for speed humps per se, but we can provide locations, a list where we have installed those. I think, too, when we get into this process, I assume other districts have the same issue where we get a lot of requests for speed bumps and so we could have an understanding of what was all requested, what was denied, what ones were done, and then what's in the queue pending. I think that would be helpful when we're just trying to answer those questions for our community, if we have that annually that we can see. Also, there was a part where we had workforce development, and I know that you guys are doing a lot with, I guess, training and career development. And then I would assume that also means with bringing new employees in as well. And so this is a question for you all, but also I think maybe a broader question for all the agency. It just makes me think about the work we're doing specifically around with our shelter programs because I've been working with, like bringing employee Prince George's into the shelter because at first they weren't doing regular stops, but then that makes me think we have all these vacancies. Are there opportunities and partnerships there to create like a pipeline of training and hiring for definitely in like public works? Yes. I mean, it certainly is. Of course. I mean, we are, you know, if there is a hiring freeze for now. Right. It restricts in our onboarding process, but we are definitely looking at ways to sort of bring people in. And the whole purpose of doing that exercise is really to serve not only as a retention tool, but also a way to attract workers to the department because we definitely need to sort of keep fresh people coming in and give them opportunities once they enter, so they stay and develop their skills, and it helps the department become stronger in what it does. And that's something I think I know we have the hiring freeze now. I hope to see like a program, and this is, I guess, for whoever is representing the county as a whole right now administration side, that we could think about creating that pipeline specifically with the shelter programs. I think there's an opportunity there and there's a huge need. I do a lot of work in the shelters in my district, and we see all of these, like, vacancy rates, and I think that's just an opportunity that we have that we could be capitalizing better on. And then I have a question about the projects we see for what's been completed and what's in the queue for completion. Because when I looked at the one you have one for completed in 2024, but do you just mean that as of date? Because there's some that are in this chart that I was told was completed in like, last budget cycle. So just like, just like a more comprehensive list, not what was just done in the last budget cycle, just so I can make sure I'm reading it correctly, because the budget list I have for complete streets in my first year had said these were already completed. Some of these were already completed. I think in the first year, what we did is we changed. I can't remember, we changed the way in which we were reporting it. We were reporting it in tranches of two or three years, I believe.

We were reporting it in tranches of two or three years, I believe. And it didn't mean that in any given year that you were looking at that those were the streets that would be done in that particular year. It was over the entire sort of window that we were looking at. So what we have done recently is that we have put the paving progress on what's called a story map. It's on the webpage. It's forward facing, and it's available to look at. And you'll see geographically where our paving program is, streets that have been done, whether it was slurried, which is suitable for residential streets, or whether we milled and paved or other methods of improving the roads that are forthcoming. So we want really to be, you know, forward facing and very transparent with what we do. But, you know, we could provide you a list of streets that we've done. There's, you know, that's not a problem, but it's. It's on the website and can be found there. And so in that dashboard, is it, like, also clear what's slated for the FY 2025 budget? Like, if a resident wanted to go see what was going to be done, they could easily find that. Yes. Okay. Yes. And that's also reflective in this list, or is this the full list of what's left? This chart that you gave us? I'm not sure which one is that. Just everything that's left, not just what's slated to be done. This is. This is what is slated to be done. To be done just in 2025. Right. Perfect. Thank you. Okay, great. Now I have a minute. It's fine. Actually, chair Watson has indulged us. We can go over a few minutes, but I don't endeavor to do that. Just a few things that I wanted to bring up. So sidewalks, just generally getting new sidewalks, and I'm being parochial here, but it does, you know, it does translate to the whole county. You know, there are. There are places where we desperately need sidewalks that. To get to where the purple line will be. That's only a few years out. We need to be planning now. We need to be putting them in this year or next year. Also, sidewalks, just. That have been lacking for kids to get to school and that kind of thing. We have a. We have a fund that then we tap into for sidewalks. We don't need to identify specific sidewalks in the budget. We just need that identify them to you and then they go into the. Tap into that fund. Is that right? Yeah, that's correct, councilman. So as I had mentioned, the way that we're doing it, because the county has probably thousands of miles of sidewalk. Right. We don't know. We'll know the number later this year as to what that is. The best way, the most efficient way to approach something like that is through a programmatic way so the first step in that program is to assess what the need is, the condition and the need. And then we are then able to sort of based on the budget that we receive or that money we have allocate the money in a very efficient way to sort of fill in links, repair bad sidewalk, or use alternative treatments, as we've discovered the grinding to improve the walkability of the walk shed. Right. I think this council, not to speak for everybody, but my opinion is this council wants to see, you know, more sidewalks, you know, built and, you know, certainly the repair sidewalks that are in need. And I know you've, you identify them as well, so I don't mister early, then this may be something that we want to add to the budget. I know we're not in the adding to the budget mode, but this is an area that, that I think is very important for the whole county. So that's something I think we may want to look at. I wanted to ask you about. I know Adelphi Road, which is between councilmember Fisher's district and mine. I appreciate the upgrades you've made to those two crossings. I know there's a larger project that relies on, I believe, a federal grant. Where are we with that? Which one is okay? And then while you're at it, I know Metzarat Road is also in that same grant, maybe, or maybe a different year of that grant. I did note somewhere in here that Metzerat was, it's a pedestrian safety, and that is somewhere in planning. But let me just raise those two. So we actually just got our federal grant agreement, which was the huge step in receiving the ss four. And actually, just as they would like to use ours as an example for other areas, because it's actually a big effort to get the grant agreement, this now allows us to move forward with the final engineering. So that's what we're getting ready to do now. We're getting ready to launch. We brought on our engineers, so now we can actually start scoping the projects and getting the designs. Most of the quarters are in different phases. So Medsorad is actually in two different grants. The one that's from Adelphi to 193 is in the SS four A. So that's, we can now start to move on that scoping and planning and then into the design. So the other section is funded out of a state tap grant, and we're actually getting ready to advertise that for construction at Metzrate, Metzrot from 650 to Adelphi. It's a separate grant that's 100% we're in our final stages. Yeah, exactly.

It's a separate grant that's 100% we're in our final stages. Yeah, exactly. No, thank you. Thank you. Okay, well, we can talk more about that offline as well. Thank you for your work on that. The urban street design standards. Thank you. We spoke recently about that. I know that your team has worked very hard on that and to get the cross sections and the, you know, the, what do we call it? The standards, whatever. I'm forgetting the exact name of it. But we also are retrofitting some over time. We try to retrofit some of the dangerous intersections and whatnot. Interested in where that falls in terms of, and I know councilmember Plugay talked about some roads in her area, but in terms of retrofitting over the course of time, where are we on that? Well, I think, councilman, the first step was having those standards because one of the flaws, as you point out with it initially, is that we had sections that no one could build. They were aspirational. They could not fit within the real estate that we had. We now, once we've adopted, once that's adopted and becomes law, we now will have sections that can be retrofitted. So that even though we don't really have like a program for doing, for sort of retrofitting roads at this current time, when, if and when we do have sections that need that, we do have the cross sections that can be used which are sort of safe, safer. And do we have a list of those areas that might be, and we don't have to go through them now, but do you have a list that you would be looking at in the future? It's not right in that organized way. It's something that we would have to develop. We don't really have that at this time. So that may be something that we need to look at closer and discuss further in the coming year and then budget for, honestly. Okay, last item I'm just going to ask about is shade trees that is as critical to pedestrian walkability as anything. And certainly in the summertime when it's 95 degrees out, how are we doing in terms of placing trees and getting them in the ground, making sure that they're maintained and watered and, and also the mounding of the bark mulch, I think that's bad for the roots, the mounding up. So, I mean, if it chokes the. Yeah, but we see that in the county. So I don't know if we're not. From us, I don't think so. Our folks are sort of arborist driven. Can you just talk a minute about shade trees and where they are so we do receive a grant from the Chesapeake Trust for trees, for DNR. Excuse me, for trees. And, you know, we have this. We planted 7000 trees and, you know, it's an ongoing. We have a really good relationship with them and we continue to sort of do that as we infill areas that don't have trees, mature trees. Now the trees that are put in are fairly smaller calipers, so they're not, you know, mature trees yet, but they will in the coming years mature. And, you know, they're, they won't damage the sidewalk because they're the appropriate tree for the planting strip. It's 7000. You said we planted 7000 trees and then many, many or most of those are along sidewalks and they're all along. That's the only place we can plan. Yeah, in the right way. Okay, well, thank you. I'm sure there's a lot more questions we could ask. We are over our time. I'm going to ask colleagues to submit anything, you know, additional to me and we will be in touch with you. Okay, but appreciate it. Mister battle, is there any further business before us? No, sir. We stamp to adjourn. Okay, well, we move to adjourn. Is there a motion? Motion made. Motion? Second.

That I've been home, I just want the county to also understand, in order for us to come back and give back to the county, we need the county help as well. It's a big thing, you know, hunt, your house is something that. I grew up in PG county. I grew up in Riverdale, Maryland, with the Parkdale high school state champions in 2003. It was important. I just want to let y'all know, you know? So it's important that we get the chance to continue to bring things back to the county, that we need that opportunity from the county to help us in order to bring things back. You know, so many people that do amazing things, that's from the county, that don't want to come back to the county because they feel like they don't get the help. So I took it upon myself to leave Houston, where I opened a restaurant with my best friend, James Harden and leave Houston and come home. To be able to give people in our county an opportunity to come back to work, to find out about fine dining, to find out about better eating, to find out about cleaner eating, to find out about hospitality, customer service, and the way to talk to people and speak to people and greet people and just honor everybody that surrounds you. And that was my main purpose of coming back to Hydesville. Hydesville just happened to be a stomping ground where I stopped, and next thing you know, I end up opening my second restaurant. So I wanted to be clear to everyone in this room, to the county, that I'm here to stay. I'm here to continue to make the county better. But I'm also going to need help from the county in order to make the county better. I can't do it by myself. Honcho House was a self funded opportunity for me that I took out of my own to do. Also. 1123 that's coming is going to be the greatest. I'm not saying it just for the county. It's going to be the greatest opportunity for fun, good eating, opportunities for everybody to have a job and the DMV, not only Hidesville, but this is just an opportunity to put PG county on the map. I'm going to continue to do that, to represent my county, continue to represent Hydesville, and continue to represent each and every person that look like me. So thank you. Thank you to the county. Thank you to my team. My whole half of my staff is here right now. And, you know, y'all basketball players, y'all know, on the court, it's a team effort, man. So Tobias wouldn't be Tobias without my team. And I just want to always acknowledge that I will never leave my team out.

It's more than anything in life, man. Just being able to please your parents, man, and everybody don't get that opportunity, because everybody parents ain't here. I've been able to be blessed to live in a two parent household my whole life, and this is the result. So thank you. Yeah. You want us to stay here? You want us to go? Okay. Okay. I want my. I want my team. I want my team to come up. Chef Tobias's team, can you come up to join us? Okay, so maybe we should go back there. Yeah, we'll do the same thing, bit. Are you guys.

So, coming from CMIT north, we're a small charter school in the corner of the county in Laurel. This is a major opportunity for us to be presented with this proclamation. We're generally a new program here. This is our first year in the three, two, one. We were in a small charter school basketball division, which wasn't challenging for us. So now going to this next division was a lot of great basketball, so it challenged us to be better, and these young men stepped up and I think they did a great job this year and all about hustle, grind and execute. Thank you. You'll go take a picture, John. Also I got to read that proclamation because council member for district one, council member Tom Zanova, he's on, he's virtually. I know you all rather heard me say it any it it's it it's over here. There's two seats over here. It. Good morning, this is the county council of Prince George's County, Maryland.

Wonderful. Good morning to you. Good morning. So we colleagues, is there any special intent intentions for invocation this morning? If not miss? Reverend, I have a request. Last week had a scare my family. My father called me on a Friday morning and told me that he was having heart surgery today. Didn't let me know anything and when I arrived he had blockages in his arteries to his heart. He's at home now resting. But I just want to pray for him and his health. I was a scared to the family. I also would like to pray for the nurses, the doctors, all the hospital administrative staff that played a part in saving my father's life. But more importantly, the work that they do each and every day, saving our loved one's life. Today and this week, we honor nurses. It's nurses appreciation week across the country and we know within our healthcare landscape that we need more nurses to be a part of that field. And so I just want to pray for the nurses and all involved that are part of lifting up our healthcare landscape this morning. Go ahead. Thank you. I just ask, as it is nurses Appreciation Week, it's also teacher appreciation Week. So I ask that you lift up our teachers. They have a serious job and I just want to say how much, you know, I highly respect them and admire them. Just pray for them, please. All the teachers, Prince George's county and just worldwide, we want to just keep them uplifted in prayer. Thank you. Any other of my colleagues have any special intentions this morning online? Virtually seeing none. Thank you for leading us this morning. Thank you. You're welcome. I would like to say thank you to everyone for this invitation to come and pray for the county. Thank you for those who are here in the absence of the council chair, to you, vice chair the council members, my dear friend Shelley Ferguson, for this invitation to communicate on behalf of yourselves and the citizens of Prince George's county. As an ambassador of peace, I believe it is important that we pursue and manifest peace in all that we think, say and do, especially while handling the business of our beloved. Prince George's county congratulates all the recipients of their proclamations and the work you do to represent Prince George's county. So without further ado, let us pray and bow our heads. Dear God of all peace, love and order, we come before you, recognizing you as healer and creator, the God who can make something out of nothing and use ordinary people to turn citizens in their situations into somebodies who are loved, cared for and belong in Prince George's county. First, forgive us of our shortcomings and all we have you have called us to be or do in our hearts, homes, community schools, restaurants, workplaces and places of worship. Some things we should have spoken or completed but were not, and vice versa. Please forgive us so that all our prayers are heard and received by you. For it is you who have created us with purpose that brings glory to your name despite or in spite of our suffering or prosperity. We are nothing without you and your spirit. We, your people, are all nobodies without you, your will or purpose. God, thank you for these nobodies that have been transformed to do the supernatural work of the county, and for that, they are somebody together as they work, along with citizens, faith leaders and community stakeholders, to achieve peace and harmony within their districts and ultimately throughout PG county. With the help of Holy Spirit empowering us to do the work, we can be the county that you've called us to be. Help them not to pursue being somebody, but to be diligent workers of peace, reconciling and restoring your people to you and your plan. Because any other self aggrandizing plan is insufficient and inept to achieving the outcomes that benefit all the citizens of Prince George's county. Those who align themselves with your will, willingly and unwillingly help with the county executive to align her will and desires to your will in these final days of her service to your people as she puts her eyes on other pursuits. Remind her and the county council of any outstanding promises to the people and continue to empower their work to execute that these your citizens need and have earned and deserve. Lord, help them to be agents of your Holy Spirit as you focus on the upcoming celebration of Pentecost. Come holy spirit and burn up anything that is not like you. Burn up and eradicate sin and the works of evil from our schools, in the streets and society. Destroy the works of the enemy that destroys our institutions of learning. Schools that have become pseudo mental health institutions where learning is secondary to their mental health and sexuality policies and procedures have weakened the children and bend towards entitlement and actions that destroy lives for generations that further create systems that distract from the true goal of educating our future leaders of French Georgia county lose peace and your spirit so that collaborative efforts in these meetings and in grassroots efforts are cultivated and tilled in our communities and raise up a new generation of parents who are engaged children who a", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Healthcare Staff", "insights": [{"observation": "Pray for the nurses, the doctors, all the hospital administrative staff that played a part in saving my father's life.

As we come to the close of this fiscal year, let everyone open their hearts and minds that listening and understanding would be made possible to all so that all the appropriate actions can be taken to bring your will into fruition. We are thankful for what you have done already and we are thankful for what you're going to do. We're thankful for the healing of council Harrison's father, God. And we thank you for all those who attended to his father God, but we thank you for the healing that is taking place within Prince George's county. People coming here to be healed. God, we ask that you would encourage the nurses and everyone that attends to your people, encourage others to join into becoming nurses that they can serve this community because it's the children's bed that we be healed. And so God, we thank you. We thank you Lord God, that it is teachers appreciation and God, I am one of your teachers and so God, I ask that you would breathe afresh on us because of the responsibilities that we have. Lord God, God, that you would keep us focused on educating your people. God, these are your people, your students. And so God, we just come and say, have your way in this place. We love you. We thank you and we'll be sure to give you all the glory and the honor for you alone deserve. It is in the mighty name of Jesus that we pray. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Thank you so much for that powerful prayer this morning. We appreciate you greatly. Thank you. Next, colleagues, we have the pledge of allegiance being led by council member at large, councilmember Hawkins. Now, we're on to requests that are being made to address the council by the public. First, we have Miss Naomi Carrington Hockman. Miss Hockman, are you here? Okay. Good morning to you. Good. You have three minutes to speak, ma'am. Thank you. Council members, constituents, I wanted to take the opportunity to lodge our protest against the fire and ice community church that wants to expand on Church Road. The reasons we object is because the road is very dangerous. It's winding and it's one lane with blinding corners. There's been discussions that part of the road is historical and cannot be modified. So we recommend moving the traffic off of old Church Road and completing that last mile to connect to route 450. We anticipate increased road traffic from their addition of a banquet facility, a gym, and the addition of 200 parking spaces. They currently have 56 parking spaces and that is problematic. Can you imagine what 200 is going to do? The noise is an issue and primarily our environmental concerns. We currently have an issue with the pond in Dixon crossing. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt. We're checking. Is this an existing or pending case? Yes. You're unable to speak to a pending case in this venue. On your agenda on page 13 is. Is our attorney. We'll. I'm having Mister Kumar come down. Okay. If we could just maybe skip this speaker for just a moment so. So that we can make sure there's a pending case. There's a ex parte law. If there's a case that's already been filed, an application that direct contact between the council and the community has to be separate. If so, if there's contact that's been made and the conversation is being had talking about a particular project that's already pending administratively, then we would have to recuse ourselves and actually have that noted from a disclosure. Disclaimer form. Are you voting today? No, it's not. As soon as an application has been filed through Maryland National Capitol park and Planning Commission. At that moment, we're not allowed to have any more other conversations because we sit in a quasi judicial role. And so we have to hear side both sides when those hearing dates happen. But to have individual contact with the council, that is prohibited by law. And Mister vice chair. Yes, in which case she's late later at the hearing. I might be wrong on that, but she mentioned it on the agenda. Number six, page 13. Yes. Mister battle has confirm that it is a water application. So if you could come this way, we'll get you set up with the appropriate public hearing. Thank you, sir. Yes, thank you. Thank you. Thank you councilmember Dunoga as well. Next to persons to request to speak to the council, we have Speaker Henry, Dominic Henry. Please join us. Sir, you have up to three minutes to speak. Thank you. Good morning, council.

Next to persons to request to speak to the council, we have Speaker Henry, Dominic Henry. Please join us. Sir, you have up to three minutes to speak. Thank you. Good morning, council. Good morning, abby. And vice chair Harris and the members of the county council. My name is Dominic Henry. I'm here to respond expressed my disappointment to council member Burroughs for saying the county executive need training wheels. And I want to pause on that because I was amongst some young people and I'm the chairman of young men incorporated, young minds Incorporated, and they all like, man, why we do that? So my point is this. We should not be dispersing any of our elected officials when we disagree with them. Your choice of words to describe the county executive is beneath you. We expect you to demonstrate the professionalism that your role as county member, county council member requires. Please curl yourself and that way we can continue to be proud of you. Yes, thank you, sir. Thank you for addressing us this morning. Next, colleagues, we have missed Juanita Moore, Akita. All right. Thank you for joining us, ma'am. We have up to three minutes to speak. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you so much, council, for having me to speak this morning. As a proud Prince George's county lifetime resident of Councilmanic District Eight, I am committed to the progressive growth and vision for Prince George's county. As an informed voter, I have a long standing appreciation and expectation in the integrity of our elected officials and hold the accountability of those that directly affect my interests as a resident as well as our collective community. Recently, I have observed a lack of integrity impacting the cohesiveness of my community in particular and our community as a whole. Council members, I'm sorry, am I interrupting a conversation? Thank you so much. Council members should be a voice of respect, reason and responsibility for the residents they represent, which should not include their personal vendetta or personal feelings in regards to other officials who are responsible for stakeholder care. Public comments made in a national platform which demean the level of service of our county's leadership should not be tolerated. The use of the term training wheels as a descriptive term for an elective colleague is upsetting to me and upsetting to our county as a whole. Prince George's county is bigger and better than this disrespectful rhetoric. We have survived a pandemic. Mental health concerns have skyrocketed, and families have suffered much loss. Let us focus on how to build up one another and not tear down our creative or create unnecessary division to obtain the progress we seek in our county. We deserve better. And I may add that as a citizen of Prince George's County, I am continue to be offended because I come before you as a collective body, to speak on something that's near and dear to my heart and the residents. And I have council members who decide that their personal conversations, again, are more important than what a community person has to say. So thank you again for your time. I appreciate each and every one of you for what you do for Prince George's county. And I look forward to our continued growth, because I am here to stay and I'm here to expect better. Thank you so much and have a wonderful day. Thank you for joining us this morning. Next we have Mister Raymond Coates. Mister Coates, are you with us this morning? Council member, I just wanted to say something real quick. If I could wait till after. It's not the time right now. Mister Coates is here to speak. Quick response to that. We're not here. Look, we're not here to be have any. The public has a right to say what they. No, I didn't say council member or. The public has the right to convey and express their thoughts and their feelings in a respectful. And no one is fighting that. Okay? No one said anything about that. We're now on to the next speaker. Thank you very much. I'd like to be recognized after public comment, if possible. Mister Coates, I'm sorry, go ahead. Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to speak before this council. I wanted to speak on our leadership, and how our leadership deals with this county, each other and our public. Comments, such as those made by Mister Burroughs, not only disparage our community, but it sends a very, very negative message to our youth. We struggle every day trying to get us to respect each other and respect our culture and our county and work we're doing. And comments like this go a long ways to undoing that work out in the community. These kind of comments reinforce the idea that people in our county, in our communities, cannot do anything well. I would suggest that in our dealings with each other and with our people in this council, that we look to our strength, we look to the best that we are, and we highlight those things that negative comments, disparaging comments that disparages individuals not be accepted that that not be a bar that this county accepts as a part of our dialogue with each other.

Respect his ideas, respect his. You don't have to agree, but respect each other. Respect the county. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you for joining us. Council member, Oregon. I just wanted briefly though, because we got to move on to legislative day number twelve. Yeah, briefly. And I do want to say I appreciate people taking time out of the day to come and testify, but I also want to know, I think we also, as a body and colleagues here, need to be mindful about having our employees come and say negative things about other colleagues on the dais and the level of appropriateness of that. And I'm not even sure if it's ethical to be having and doing those types of things. So. But I appreciate everyone's comments and everyone coming to testify today. Thank you, council member Oriata.

So now, colleagues, we have under the proposed correspondence and administrative officers report, we have a letter, proposed letter to the Honorable Andrew Friedsen, president of the Montgomery County Council, transmitting. For the Prince George's County Council proposed recommendations of the fiscal year 2025 operating capital budgets of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission for the Maryland National Capitol park and Planning Commission and the Washington Suburban Transit Commission. We have a overview of the letter being made by Mister Battle. Mister Battle, thank you for joining us. Thank you, Mister chair. Members of the council, before you is the by county letter that represents the culmination of staff work and council review of the by county budgets, those being the Maryland National Capital park and Planning Commission. The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission and the Washington Suburban Transit Commission. And so I'm joined here at the table by our illustrious county auditor, Miss Takesa Green. And we have Mister Eric Irving is here also that worked on the park and planning portion. And I also want to acknowledge the work of Miss Raina Hightower and Mister Josh Hamlin on working on these budgets. Now, as far as this process is concerned, once we approve this letter, it will be transmitted to Montgomery county and their council is engaging in the same process. In fact, they met yesterday on these budgets, and we expect a letter to come from their council president, and we will do the same upon approval here today. We will send that letter to Montgomery in advance of the by county meeting that's set for this Thursday. So in terms of what's in the letter, the first portion of it deals with the WSSC part of the budget. And the commission came and did a presentation on their budget in late March. And we had a staff report presented to the tie committee on April 11. And after that, the recommendations from the committee are what are included here in the letter, which include a budget that, as proposed, is an 8.5% increase over last year's budget. Now, usually that percentage applies to a rate increase on the volumetric, water and sewer rates. This year, the commission's approach was slightly different. It includes 2.4% increase in the volumetrics, water and sewer rates, but it also includes significant increase to the fixed fees. And so those increases to fixed fees are around 65%. Now, while that sounds very high is because those fees haven't been increased in a number of years. I believe it was 2018 2017. So, and let me acknowledge the presence of the general manager, Kesha Powell, and the CFO, Mister Minessi Masara, and others in the room who have done a lot of work on this budget. So the point being that this year's approach to the budget, slightly different, large increase in the fixed fees. There were concerns raised during the committee's discussion about the impact on the lower volume users, but we do acknowledge that the commission has increased funding for their customer assistance programs, almost doubling the amount of funding that's available for customer assistance. So, you know, because of that, we are, staff was comfortable with recommending approval of the budget as submitted. Now, this budget, the letter also refers to the capital budget as well. And I just wanted to point out in Montgomery's meeting yesterday, they mentioned the desire to add some language to one of the bye county water projects. And so I just wanted to bring it up now, just so you're aware of it. So when it's mentioned on Thursday, you won't be surprised about it. And it's the Potomac water filtration plant, submerged channel intake project, and it's basically a project that's been in the CIP for a number of years. Most of the funding has continued to be in the out years, but they're planning on doing some planning, expending some planning money this year. And so the Montgomery county folks decided that it was important to add some language requiring that both councils receive information about the results of those planning efforts before they move forward with any construction. And again, the construction is projected not to occur until 2030. So what we're doing is just making sure we're up to date on what they're doing before they proceed beyond planning. So, mister chair, the numbers that are here, the 8.5% reven", "esg_v1": [{"name": "KCG Companies", "insights": [{"observation": "ltifamily residential development located in Capitol Heights developed by KCG companies.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Park Place at Addison Road Metro project", "insights": [{"observation": "Resolution concerning public safety facility surcharge for the purpose of approving a full waiver of the public safety facility surcharge for all residential units within the park place at Addison Road Metro project.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC)", "insights": [{"observation": "Recommendations of the fiscal year 2025 operating capital budgets of WSSC include a budget that, as proposed, is an 8.5% increase over last year's budget.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "WSSC's budget includes 2.4% increase in the volumetrics, water, and sewer rates, but it also includes significant increase to the fixed fees - around 65%.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Increased funding for WSSC's customer assistance programs, almost doubling the amount of funding available.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Potomac Water Filtration Plant", "insights": [{"observation": "Planning on doing some planning, expending some planning money this year for the submerged channel intake project.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Ensuring both councils receive information about the results of those planning efforts before they move forward with any construction.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "KCG Companies", "insights": [{"observation": "ltifamily residential development located in Capitol Heights developed by KCG companies.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Park Place at Addison Road Metro project", "insights": [{"observation": "Resolution concerning public safety facility surcharge for the purpose of approving a full waiver of the public safety facility surcharge for all residential units within the park place at Addison Road Metro project.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC)", "insights": [{"observation": "Recommendations of the fiscal year 2025 operating capital budgets of WSSC include a budget that, as proposed, is an 8.5% increase over last year's budget.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "WSSC's budget includes 2.4% increase in the volumetrics, water, and sewer rates, but it also includes significant increase to the fixed fees - around 65%.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Increased funding for WSSC's customer assistance programs, almost doubling the amount of funding available.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Potomac Water Filtration Plant", "insights": [{"observation": "Planning on doing some planning, expending some planning money this year for the submerged channel intake project.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Ensuring both councils receive information about the results of those planning efforts before they move forward with any construction.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 4972942, "chunk_end_time": 5461898, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3544?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3544?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=4972"}, {"start": 54000, "end": 60000, "text": "terday, they mentioned the desire to add some language to one of the bye county water projects.

And again, the construction is projected not to occur until 2030. So what we're doing is just making sure we're up to date on what they're doing before they proceed beyond planning. So, mister chair, the numbers that are here, the 8.5% revenue enhancement, the 162 million gallons per day commissions proposed authorized work years, is an increase of 127 work years over the 2024 budget and approval of the operating budget of slightly over 1 billion, which is an increase of 88.6 million, or 9.5% over the 2024 budget. So also indicating that they're not going to be an increase in the systems development charge, but the maximum allowable increase is increased with the consumer price index, as we do every year, but there's no increase to the system development charge itself. You have some numbers down there for the total WSSC CIP, as well as the information only projects. And on page two, you see there, there's a new CIP project, National View Sewer main, which is totally believe, is totally funded by developer contributions believe. And so that is the summary of the CIP, I mean, of the WSSC portion of the letter. If Mister Irving, if you have some questions about what's going on with the parking planning piece. So. Yes. Oh, well, okay, misses gray. All right, I'll go ahead and just give you a quick intro and then I'll turn it over to Mister Irving. As you know, with the Maryland National Capital park and Planning Commission, at the by county meeting, you're primarily approving any compensation adjustments for the whole commission, as well as the by county portion of the budget. The rest of the budgets you'll approve with the county budget on May 23. So we only approving the by county portion. So that includes agency wide collective bargaining compensation for the two collective bargaining units as well as non represented employees. There's currently a compensation marker in the budget as they're still pending negotiations with the bargaining units. So for the Montgomery county portion, that marker is 6.4 million, and for the prince George's county portion, it's 8 million. Regarding the CAS budget, as per usual, Montgomery county is proposing to do some cuts to the CAS budget. And when there's cuts on the Montgomery county side, there has to be comparable cuts on the Prince George's county side. The two councils did discuss the potential cuts and the agreement. I'll turn over to Mister Irving, who has the details, but he will let you know where we have come to an agreement in terms of this letter that you all are voting on this morning. Thank you. So I guess to sort of piggyback on what Miss Greene mentioned, the Prince George's County, I mean, the Montgomery County Council, their county executive, required them to sort of make cuts to the budget. It was in the area of 800,000. Parking planning sent back cuts that they thought that they could absorb at that amount. Their parks and planning committee restored some of those cuts, and so where they ultimately sort of landed was to eliminate some of the positions that parking planning requested. There's a learning management coordinator, there's a treasury operations position, and then there's an HR position that was previously funded last year. So with that plus just an assumption of general lapse in their funding, their committee recommended to reduce parking planning's request by about half a million dollars. The compromise between the two was to one thing, and I know that councilmember Franklin will appreciate this, the supplier diversity chief that was requested was restored to the budget. In addition, there was an ADA coordinator that was requested. The compromise was to fund a half a year of disposition. Essentially, they'll be able to have the position, but they'll hire that position in January to save some of that money. In addition, and I think some council members will appreciate this, there was a requested apprenticeship specialist that was actually cut from the position, but part of the compromise is to fully fund that position on the Prince George's county side. So rather than split funding that position, Prince George's county is going to fully fund that apprenticeship specialist position, and that that person will work exclusively on Prince George's county projects. And so that we, we were able to keep that position in keep the ADA coordinator position and the diversity supplier position. And so that's, that's sort of what you see in the reflected budget. And so ultimately, the parking planning CAS budget will increase by $1.3 million on the Prince George's county side and $1.25 million on the Montgomery county side. So they'll still see an increase as a result of this budget. Sir, I know, my colleague, councilmember Burroughs, had a couple questions. Council member Burroughs. Thank you. Mister Battle, am I reading this correctly? And I'm understanding, based off of your remarks, that by approving this letter, we are supporting an 8.5 fee increase to our residents for WSSC. Is that correct? Well, it's. Sorry, it's a combined. The impact is 8.5%.

So they'll still see an increase as a result of this budget. Sir, I know, my colleague, councilmember Burroughs, had a couple questions. Council member Burroughs. Thank you. Mister Battle, am I reading this correctly? And I'm understanding, based off of your remarks, that by approving this letter, we are supporting an 8.5 fee increase to our residents for WSSC. Is that correct? Well, it's. Sorry, it's a combined. The impact is 8.5%. It'll be 2.4% on their volumetric rates based on usage, but also there's an increase on the fixed fees, which equates on average to the average user about $25 a quarter, maybe $100 a year. So that's what's proposed. I just have a concern because I just had a community meeting with Apple Grove community in Fort Washington, and several of the senior citizens mentioned that their WSSC bills at one point were pretty predictable. And now they're, you know, from month to month, they skyrocket and they normalize and they skyrocket and they normalize. They're unsure as to what the wrong reason is and I'm hesitant to vote for anything that would exacerbate that issue. Okay, well I would, as a suggestion, I know that as I mentioned, the commission is putting a lot more emphasis and funding into their customer assistance programs to the extent that any of those residents might qualify for that. That's one approach. But I would say also that there's probably an opportunity for some interaction between the commission outreach folks to go over and talk to the folks to try to understand what the rationale is for the fluctuation. Because if it's something that's happening already, there may be an opportunity for them to help the folks understand what the reasons are for that. They do some analysis. Just so that I'm clear. On average, this 8.5 fixed fee increase and the volumetric water increase would on average account to how much per household? Like I said, for there are charts in the budget that show the impact on the typical customer, or average customer based on the amount of usage. And so. And that's where I get the number that it equals to about $25 per quarter. Okay, $100 per year. So now once you get to, you know, the higher volumes, and usually more than that is, you're usually talking about commercial enterprises. All right, thank you. Mister Battle, Mister Burroughs. Mister Burroughs. I do believe that the WSSC put millions and millions of dollars, it was a significant investment into customer service, financial aid assistance for that, those bills. My memory is foggy, but I think it was around 12 million or something. Mister chair, I think it is closer to around seven. Yeah. And previously it was in the three. 7 million. I'm sorry, they're holding 7 million. I was off and that's agree. An increase from three was about 3.5 previously. 121% increase by about several million. Thank you. Thank you Mister Burroughs. Thank you Mister battle. Colleagues, is there a motion to authorize the chair's signature for the proposed letter to the honorable Andrew Friesen? I think council member Franklin's had his hand up. I'm so sorry councilmember Franklin. I'm sorry, I didn't see you. No problem. Can you all hear me? I'm not sure if you can hear me. We can hear you. Can you hear us? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes. Thank you mister chair. So to ask a WSSC question, so I know there was a big, big, big debate some years ago about increasing rates or the costs of water based on larger residential users. So people who may have had larger use patterns, usage patterns, where did that land ultimately? Did you ultimately go with a particular plan about adjusting rates based on the volume of residential customers? We have a representative from WSSC is going to speaking council member Franklin. Thank you council Maneti. Tempti Musar, chief financial officer. What we did is the charges for volumetric. We have a four tier system, and with each tier the prices for the water increase, so that addresses high usage. So the higher the tier, the more the charge you get per gallon. So if you are a high water user it's, it's sort of like a step up. So each new tier is when you get charged the rate for that usage within the tier. Gotcha. And there's probably no quick way to tell us what the four tiers are, is there? Is it too complicated to get into today? I can send that information off the top of my head. Okay. Okay. I'm not sure what each rate is for the tiers. That'd be great. That would be great. Thank you. Thank you mister chair. Thank you so much council member for mister chair. Mister chair. Could I just add one thing in my conversation about the fixed fees? In response to councilmember Burroughs, I neglected to mention that the customers who qualify for the customer assistance program do not pay any of the fixed fees. So just want to make sure you clear about that. So there are opportunities for some of the customers to not have to pay those fees. We can, we can provide more information on the. Please do. I don't think the masses know about it. Okay. Thank you Mister battle. Thank you council member Burroughs. Any other of my colleagues have any questions or comments? We didn't mention the WSTC part on the last page, but just wanted to mention that that does include the county share of the administrative portion of WSTC's budget, which essentially is the representatives from Prince George's, Montgomery and the Maryland Department of Transportation who work together to represent Maryland on the Wamada board.

And you want to, you want to go through it? Yes. The additions package, and I will read it's just the same item, but the title of it has changed, sir, and I was in the process of sending that over, so I will just get back to it here. Sorry about that. Okay, so it is the. Excuse me, let's letter 057-2024 B and it is proposed joint letter to the Honorable Christina Henderson, chair, National Capital Region Transportation Transportation Planning Board, Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, regarding the Southern Maryland Rapid Transit Smart project. And the only change to the additions package that was previously distributed is that it is now a joint letter. And the letter does have a few changes, and I am submitting that to you all by email. Thank you, colleagues. And as you heard from Madame Clerk, it is a proposed letter of correspondence. Administrative officers report. Proposed letter to the Honorable Christina Henderson, chair of the national Capital Region Transportation Planning Board, metropolitan Washington councils of governments. And regarding the Southern Maryland Rapid Transit SMRT project, you should see it in your emails. I can have printed copies as well if you prefer that, but you should see it on your screens. If you could put it up on the screen, it'd be great. That way we have a chance to view it. Oh, council member Franklin, while we're waiting for that, we're going to yield the floor to you, sir. Councilman, this letter is just to endorse a position the council has had for many, many years, which is to move forward with the Southern Maryland Rapid Transit project, which could bring light rail to the 5301 corridor from Branch Avenue metro station all the way to White Plains in Charles county. The transportation Planning Board is meeting soon to confirm its long range transportation plan. This would be a joint letter from the council and the county executive to support adding that project, which has received both federal and state funding to that program. We have our key council advocate. Councilman Rellison serves on the transportation planning board, and Charles county also has sent a letter in endorsing the project as well. Thank you, mister chair. Thank you, Councilmember Franklin. Now I'm going to turn to councilmember Burroughs, and then councilmember Olson like to move favorable. Okay. There's been a motion to move favorable to authorize the chair's person's signature. There's been a second by. Who is that? Councilmember Watson. Councilmember Watson made the second. Any discussion on that motion, Mister chair? Yes, I would just say I want to thank Mister Franklin for bringing this up. There was some discussion from Commissioner Reuben Collins from Charles county about this at the last meeting, and councilmember Franklin's right, we have as a body been supportive of this project for a long time, and I'm happy to support it at the transportation planning board on May 15. So I will be supporting this. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mister Olson, for your support. I know councilmember Franklin has been working on this for many, many, many years, and it is very important for the south to be able to have this opportunity to be presented for rapid transit. So we have a motion is seconded. Madam Clerk, please call to roll. Vice chair Harrison. Madam Clerk, I vote aye. Miss Blaghaine? Aye. Mister Burroughs? Aye. Mister Dunoga? I vote aye. And explain I recall supporting this long before anybody else was on the council, probably 2007 or eight. Mister Franklin? I vote aye. Yes, you're right. This project has been around that long.

Colleagues, moving forward, we have, under public hearings of bills eligible for third reading and enactment, we have CB 2024. This is an act concerning the woodland and wildlife habitat Conservation Ordinance for the purpose of revising the existing subtitle in order to comply with state mandated revisions as per the Maryland Forest Conservation act. Revising and adding definitions, revising applicability and exemption requirements revising plan review, validity and grandfathering requirements revising certain definitions, providing for certain fee in lieu establishes, establishing a certain fund, revising the variance of appeal process, revising the enforcement process, revising the conservation requirements, including priority areas, thresholds, replacement ratios, revising conservation requirements, design criteria, priorities, options, and bonding. Revising forest stand delineation area and revising forest harvesting. This is sponsored by council members Harrison, Watson, Olson, Fisher, Hawkins, Denogan, oriada. I know that, Madam Clerk, we have a speaker's list, correct? That is correct, sir. All right. And we have for our speakers list, if you could please come to the front. The first speaker is Janet Gingold. Thank you for joining us today. And you have up to three minutes to speak. Thank you, ma'am. Good morning. I'm Janet Gingold and I'm speaking today on behalf of Prince George's Sierra Club. The Sierra Club supports CB 2024 and we urge the council to pass it, but continue to work for realizing the benefits of trees for decreasing health disparities and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Updating the woodland and wildlife habitat conservation is necessary for the county to comply with the new state regulations and to meet our climate goals. But more important, tree conservation is a health issue. Heat waves kill people and trees can help decrease the impacts of excess heat. It's also an equity issue. While our overall tree canopy coverage might look good, the distribution of our trees is very uneven. We remain concerned that even with these much improved rules, we will still see trees removed from where they are scarce and planted where they are more plentiful, where there are fewer trees, higher temperatures increase the risks of health problems for vulnerable populations, especially the very young, the very old, for people who work and play outdoors, people with health conditions that affect their ability to adapt to heat, and people who don't have access to air conditioning. As we increase density and transit oriented zones, special care must be taken to conserve existing forest remnants and use green infrastructure, especially trees, to mitigate heat island effects. Please do all you can to put a value on trees, especially mature trees, and especially in our urbanized areas. Under CB 2024, a hierarchy of afforestation and reforestation prioritizes conserving mature trees and replanting on site. However, in section 25 122 c, the conservation method priorities there's no clear penalty or incentive that makes it worthwhile for developers to meet requirements through higher priority methods. We ask that you consider requiring a greater acreage ratio. When lower priority methods are chosen, fees in lieu and penalties for violation should be substantially greater. Also, we'd like to see stronger criteria for allowing variances so that they become rare and not routine. Please keep in mind that replanting does not instantly replace the benefits of trees removed during a heat wave next summer. A recently planted seedling will provide no significant shade or evaporative cooling. Most of us here today will be dead and gone before an acre replanted today can provide the ecosystem services provided by an acre of mature woodland it supposedly replaces. The Sierra Club urges the county council to make CB 2024 as strong as it can be and continue to work to ensure that already overburdened communities do not suffer disproportionately from the impacts of climate change.

Thank you. Thank you so much. Next we have attorney Robert Antonetti. Good afternoon, vice chair Harrison and members of the county council. For the record, my name is Robert Antonetti with the law firm of Shipley and Horn. Today I'm here on behalf of several clients who have ongoing development applications, many of which have been reviewed by this body. First, let me state that while I'm not opposed to CB 2024 as a whole, I have significant concerns regarding the grandfathering provisions set forth in section 25 119 g of this legislation. These concerns relate to projects, many of which are some of the largest and most economically significant in the county, being able to rely on their approved tree conservation plans and or amend them in accordance with existing regulations while their underlying land use approvals remain valid. Projects that have a valid tree conservation plan one, for example, usually with the preliminary plan of subdivisions, CSP CDP under the prior ordinance, should be able to rely on that TCP one approval to then file the subsequent tree conservation plan two using the same regulations the TCP one was approved under. It's not abundantly clear from this legislation that that can occur. Similarly, some of the largest projects in the county have many stages or phases that will need the ability to file new tree conservation plan two s using the grandfather provisions to keep moving forward. Similarly, tree conservation plans two, while otherwise valid, must be able to be revised using existing regulations to avoid significant and unintended consequences of land use entitlements conflicting with tree conservation plants. The current language in this bill seems to indicate that any revision to a tree conservation plan not accepted by July 1, 2024 must use the new regulations in this division. Tree conservation plans are amended all the time for utilities, for outfalls, for very minor things, so having that flexibility for large projects is critically important. Moving forward. As for expiration dates of a tree conservation plan, this bill does not also seem to clearly align with the validity periods in the zoning ordinance under the transitional provisions. July 1, 2028 seems arbitrary for expiration of approved tree conservation plans when large projects can take much longer to develop using existing land use entitlements I do align myself with the April 29 letter from the MBIA, and I respectfully request that this bill please be referred back to the tiE committee to continue the dialogue regarding grandfathering. Given the current economic climate locally and nationally, it is critical that the approval periods in this bill do not negate or conflict with the validity periods of existing land use entitlements and projects moving forward. I thank for your time and consideration. Thank you, sir. Next, we have attorney Matthew Tedesco. Do you have three minutes to speak, sir? Good afternoon, mister chairman, members of the council. For the record, Matthew Tedesco with the law firm of McMose in Greenbelt, Maryland. I would align myself with Mister Antonetti's comments as well as the letter dated, excuse me, the letter from MBIA presented on this bill. I too am not in opposition to CB 20. However, we do respectfully request that this council recommit this bill back to tie committee prior to CB 20 being voted out of committee and in response to House Bill 1511, which was pending at the time that this bill was voted out of committee. The committee chair acknowledged that if House Bill 1511 passed, which it has done and has since been enrolled, CB 20 would be, quote, brought back in reliance. On this. We respectfully ask that CB 20 be recommitted to tie to adjust the grandfathering previously mentioned by Mister Antonetti and as it addresses previously approved plans. As the current grandfathering language in section 25 119 g indicates it was added after introduction and the industry only learned about it in mid April without a meaningful ability to be heard on the late minute addition to CB 20. Outside of this public hearing today, there are significant issues and concerns with the current version of CB 20 regarding grandfathering. These must be addressed prior to adopting the bill. The best way to address these is comprehensively is to recommit this bill to tie. Since House Bill 1511 passed and moved the effective date of Senate Bill 526 back two years, the portions of House Bill 1511 that reference the effective date of July 2024, we believe, were to allow jurisdictions to fix a limited issue created by the state in 2021 regarding mitigation banking. Therefore, the date is limited to address that purpose only. It is not a date whereby a jurisdiction needs to totally revamp its entire wilderness Conservation ordinance. We believe that DNR's intent to include the July 2024 date in House Bill 1511 was limited to the mitigation banking only so as to help jurisdictions and applicants address an issue created by the state in 2021 regarding banking. The July 2024 date is not a mandate or requirement for jurisdictions to hurriedly pass a bill. House Bill 1511 delays the effective date of Senate Bill 526 by two years. Therefore, this council can and should recommit CB 20 to tie to work through the", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Sierra Club", "insights": [{"observation": "The Sierra Club urges the county council to make CB 2024 as strong as it can be and continue to work to ensure that already overburdened communities do not suffer disproportionately from the impacts of climate change.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Law Firm of Shipley and Horn (on behalf of several clients)", "insights": [{"observation": "Significant concerns regarding the grandfathering provisions set forth in section 25 119 g of this legislation.

Therefore, this council can and should recommit CB 20 to tie to work through the grandfathering provisions that currently have not been properly vetted. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you, sir, for joining us. Next we have Mister Matthew Wessel. Thank you, wisel. All right, Wessel. All right. Please excuse me for that, sir. Oh, it's no problem. Good morning. My name is Matt Wessel. I'm a landscape architect, a certified arborist, and I chair the environmental committee for the Maryland Building Industry association. I've also been involved for years at the state level on various forest bills, including SB 526, which was the catalyst for CP 20 that we're talking about here today. I'm here because we're concerned with the grandfathering provisions included in CP 20 that we just learned about on April 12, which was after the tie committee. This has the ability to make tcps expire before the underlying entitlement plans are prepared for. And just as a little background, every entitlement application has an associated tree conservation plan. And if that tree conservation plan expires before the entitlement plan does, you're going to find yourself in some situations where there's just simply because of how much the mitigation requirements have up themselves at the state. You're just not going to be able to find the offsite mitigation needed. So your only plan is going to be to meet mitigation, is going to go back to the drawing board and save more forests, essentially voiding your underlying entitlement. So that said, this was contemplated when we were creating SB 526. So plans with forest plans approved before July 2024 were not, were not subject to the law, and they were excluded from calculations that were required to determine whether or not a local ordinances bill was known at loss. There also weren't any expiration provisions in the state law. CB 20 was attempting to beat the effective date of July 2024, and this year the General assembly delayed it by two years with the passage of HB 1511, which was requested by Mako. On the argument that I do want to just point out that HB 1511, I do want to acknowledge that they did work to fix a issue with forest banking that was created by the state in 2021. As was mentioned, this was intended to be helpful, and there are many jurisdictions out there that do not have any forest banking at all, local jurisdictions that just don't have the land for it. So I'm not convinced that this is something that needs to be fixed prior to July 1, 2024. We could just do the status quo and banking and fix it at a later date. But I wanted to point that out because the scope of that was so limited compared to everything that's included in CB 20, that I think it just shouldn't be used as an excuse to pass a bill with bad grandfathering provisions. So thank you for letting me testify. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Next we have Mister Alex Vilgas. How you doing, sir? Thank you for joining us. Good morning. My name is Alex Villegas. I'm here to voice my opposition to approving CV 20 today. Our stance is not one of complete opposition to the bill. Instead, we believe it's necessary for the bill to be re referred to TIA committee to address specific concerns comprehensively. This approach aligns with the intention expressed by the committee chair, especially considering the passage of HP 1511, which was anticipated to influence the handling of CV 20. We rely on the committee chairs assurance that if the HB 1511 pass, CV 20 would be revised. However, despite the passage of HB 1511, our concerns remain unaddressed, particularly regarding grandfathering provisions with adequate debate. I want to acknowledge the park and planning environmental planning section that has worked closely together with the industry, especially with the environmental committee, to get this bill right, but saying that the delay of the state law implementations provide an opportunity to ensure all stakeholders understand the impacts of the expiration provisions. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next we have speaker Shulers Schulers scholars. Okay. Next we have Morgan Michael. Hey, Miss Morgan, how are you? Good afternoon. My name is Morgan Michael. I'm here to oppose CB 2024 on behalf of Stanley Martin Holmes. Stanley Martin Holmes has committed a large investment in Prince George's county with a handful of projects that are now at risk should CB 2024 be passed by this council as currently written. Oh, sorry for that. Is this better? Perfect. Most projects require multiple sequential approvals that take years to complete and secure. CB 2024 would have a significant impact on the valid entitlements that we have been working on for many years now. We request that the bill be re referred to the tie committee to address several concerns raised by MBIA, specifically the grandfathering provisions. Thank you, thank you, thank you for joining us.

I'm the field development coordinator for a residential real estate company known as Holly Ridge Development LLC. We've been actively developing in Prince George's county for nearly 30 years and we're currently developing several sites in the county and have concerns about how CB 2024 impacts current and future projects in the works. I am here to respectfully ask that the council refer CB 2024 back to the committee to address our industry's concerns. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir, for joining us. Next we have Devin Ergo. Yes, thank you, sir, for joining us. You have three minutes to speak. Good afternoon and thank you for having me. My name is Devin Ergo and I represent Doctor Horton. As you are aware, the industry has been working with environmental planning on revisions to subtitle 25 since October 2023. On April 12, 2024, after our final workgroup meeting and without our consent, we learned of new expiration provisions that we believe to be unnecessary, unfair and inconsistent with State Bill 526, which was extended by House Bill 1511. CBE 2024 would affect hundreds of projects with existing valid entitlements, as well as create uncertainty and hardship for developers, property owners and investors. Undermining the trust and collaboration of the industry and environmental planning. Undermining the trust and collaboration the industry and environmental planning have worked very hard to build over the past year. We are not asking to change the law, but it is not necessary to rush a bill that contains such inconsistencies with the intent of the state law. We simply ask that CB 2024 be re referred to the tie committee as there is not an immediate need to revise the ordinance, and as was anticipated by the committee, should house Bill 1511 pass, which it did. We greatly appreciate your attention and consideration of our position, and we hope to work with you to find an agreeable solution. Thank you. Thank you, sir, for your testimony. Next, we're going to circle back around Miss Shulers, Miss Hall, Miss. Director of planning for National Capital park and Planning Commission. Thank you for joining us, ma'am. Thank you so much. Councilor Lakeisha hall, for the record, planning director for Prince George's county, greatly appreciate this opportunity. We know this is a very important ordinance before the council today, as it was referenced by a lot of the speakers. We've been working very hard over the last year to be able to get public input. We've been able to listen and also understand the importance of having an ordinance in place for the county. Our job is to make sure that the council has what we need to be able to start moving forward the reporting requirements and also make sure that we're starting to be more compliance with no net loss, because it's very important that we have something in place. So we're here to answer any specific questions that we have, but we feel very confident that we can continue to work through the issues if we need to come back to the committee as well. Thank you so much. Thank you for your testimony. Next. Absolutely. No, no, go ahead. Go ahead. Councillor hall, could you come back? Can I ask you a question? So thank you for being here. And I know we've had conversations with you and your staff about this, and you've expressed the importance of getting this passed, because the July 1 deadline does still have implications. And also the, the banking, the mitigation banking kicks in at that time. Could you speak to that a little bit? As well as, and my colleagues, I just want to say about this, the grandfathering provision that has been brought up, I want to make sure that, Director hull, that you and your staff would work with us if we do have to pass this today, which I understand is the direction that, you know, we are being given through Parkland planning, that it really should be passed, that you would work to send us a bill to address a lot of the outstanding questions and concerns that are out there, because we don't want to lose out by not passing something, but we also want to be responsive to the concerns. So could you speak to just a little bit of that, please? Certainly. And so I do have my staff here as well to fill in any gaps that I may have not able to provide. So it's important that we provide opportunities for applications that are pending right now that want to participate in the banking process. So we do have some applications that want to be able to activate that request. And so our job is to provide that path forward for those applications and then start being able to monitor our no net loss across the entire county because we do have to comply with the state ordinance by 2028 with the reporting component, we meet with MBIA and others on a regular basis. We have staff there once a month. So I'm more than happy to your point.

And so that's something that we do offer. And so I do want to bring up Miss Schuller if she wants to provide anything else in regards to what she has been doing on this effort with her team. Good morning. Katina Schoeler of the planning department. We have heard the concerns of the development community, and we do urge you to adopt this today. And we are ready to go back to work on a bill to address the grandfathering provisions as needed. We have been working regularly with the development community, and we're ready to continue working with them to address those needs. We understand that the importance of banking has support some very major projects in this County, Westphalia Woodmore town Center, Brandywine crossing the station at Riverdale park. And so we urge you to adopt this because we need the banking back to continue to support very important, countywide, significant projects, including those that are also public as well. So we are ready to go back to do that. We ask that you adopt today. Adopting this today will not immediately affect grandfather projects, given the date. So we have time to work together, to work with the tie, to work with the stakeholders, to work with the public to fix that. And thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony. Councilmember Olson, does that conclude your comment? Because I know during discussion I'm going to have some. Okay, so, councilmember Hawkins, thank you, madam director, could you come back up, please? You all said you have been working with the representatives, I'm sure, who spoke before you for a year. What is concerning, if I listen? And we spoke about HB 1151, I heard my colleague, councilmember Olson, speak about it. Council member Savakis, brought up that this had to be done today before July 1, 2024. But if you all have been working with the other representatives in the business community for over a year. But then I hear you say that, oh, we need to pass this today, but we'll go back and work with them. But if you've been working with them for a year, why we are not out of place of, you know, because councilman, Mister Vaka's told me that by the state law, we had to do this by July 1. So help me understand, what is it? Do we just need to do this, or we just want to come back and work on it? What's going on? Why is it, before you answer that, council member Dunoga, I see your hand. We'll recognize you in a second. I just didn't want you to think I forgot about you. Go ahead, Director hall. Okay. And so, for clarification, as we know that there was an extension provided by the state, and so the date that the park and planning team has been communicating is the importance of us to start the no net loss conversation again in the county. We want to have an ordinance in place that starts the conversation. And so July 1 was what we were gearing towards to start that process again for those applicants that are interested. So keep in mind, the legislation that has been in front of the development community is the same for the, for the context of the grandfathering. We recently had a conversation, as you know, before the council on grandfathering provisions, and so we were able to work through that as part of that effort. And so my understanding is that some of the comments I'm hearing right now are comments about what projects are eligible to meet certain grandfathering provisions so they don't have to meet the new standards. And so that is something I feel very comfortable in working through specific projects to see if there's any concerns that I'm hearing that we can address. And so that's what I mean, looking at it from a case by case basis, because I'm not really sure exactly what is the issue that each project is looking at at this time. My last question, Mister vice chair. So, Mister Vox, if I understood you correctly, it was by state law that we have to do this by July 1. But as I listen to you, you're saying it's the planning department's preference that we do this by July 1. So is it by law or is it by preference? So I would defer to, I wasn't privy to the conversation, but initially, July 1 was what's required by the state. And so my understanding is that we do have the ability, but like I said, this ordinance allows for us to start moving forward on the tree preservation efforts in this county. To have a law in place to start that effort, but I'll defer for more clarification. Well, I'm sorry, Mister place church. Just very quickly, the extension bill in Annapolis, and please, Miss Bacchus, please chime in. I was in the impression that it was a clean, would be a clean bill. A clean extension bill. There's a lot of moving pieces to it, and so I feel bad that I didn't understand that at the time. I didn't know they said extension. I thought, well, that's just an extension. Everything gets extended. I'm going to defer to Miss Zavakis, though, because she understands it much better than I do. Miss Zevakis, Tony Zevakis.

Everything gets extended. I'm going to defer to Miss Zavakis, though, because she understands it much better than I do. Miss Zevakis, Tony Zevakis. Do you want me to. Okay. Because I, I'm still consciously incompetent, too, because basically the bill from the state this year, I think, as tie chair Olson just pointed out, is absolutely right. It started out looking perhaps a lot more clean or succinct and wholesale than it was my understanding of it, and this is probably two lines or less, and then I'll be quiet, is that it started out as an extension. However, there was discussion about, well, okay, maybe it's not a wholesale, this extension. We're going to defer everything except the banking requirements. We really need that to go live January 1. However, in order to make the banking of the tree banking provision of state law work, they needed to activate what's known as a priority forest provision, which is tied to it and how that works with the priority forest regulations. Again, the details of this are really beyond me. This is my broad brush, 10,000 foot view. The priority forest. Part of it has a lot of tentacles. And what happens is if you bite down on this and you kick the can down the road, we'll call it right. You're now stuck with this priority forest stuff. I'm not really even sure what all the implications of that are. Is that a fair assessment, Director hall? That's very fair. Thank you. Yeah. So the best move, in my very limited, humble opinion, is to pass what you can while you can, which gives you the maximum amount of leeway and avoids until we know what we're even enacting. The fallout from what was, let me just say, as a trained legislative draft person, I couldn't even really find my way out of the bag in that bill. It was going all over the place. So I'm not even sure in good conscience I can recommend that we take advantage of that. And in big picture, when in doubt, look around to see what other jurisdictions are doing, other jurisdictions are all moving forward on theirs if they're not already finished. And that to me telegraphed that I don't think we want to wait on this thusly. If there is a noise in whatever the grandfathering date is, or whatever that is, it seems to me that the lesser of two evils would be to enact what you have and fine tune later with a very succinct piece of further legislation. Thank you, councilmember Hawkins. Does that answer your question? Okay, you want to leave it alone? Okay. Council member Dunoga. Thank you. I have a question. I think maybe miss shoulders is better to answer, but Miss hall can take a shot. Very simple question. Have other counties enacted stronger forest conservation acts than Prince George is already actually, before the 2023 legislation, Montgomery county had already enacted prior, so they had met some of the amendments that were in the 2023 legislation. When the 2023 legislation, let me see, Frederick county was also even before that, I believe Anne Arundel county did do some amendments, but they have to make some changes to be in line with the 2023 legislation. And I know those for sure off the top of my head, during the conversations of our meetings, we were told that our county, Charles county, and I think Baltimore were really the ones that behind of all the larger counties. So, and I just want to add, and I know some of you have heard me say it a million times, Prince George's county was the first to have a tree conservation ordinance. We inspired the state to do theirs when we updated ours in 2010. It also motivated some county to start looking at their legislation. So I believe it is time for us to get back in line to be the leader of this and ours. And I believe we have a very strong legislation, but I also think it's reasonable for development. And I think it's a win for the county, it's a win for plan 2035, it's a win for the draft climate action plan. And thank you for the opportunity for me to get. No problem. I'm glad I asked a question. Thank you, Miss Schullers. Thank you, mister Dunoga. I'm going to turn now to councilmember Olson. Just going to make a motion. Sorry, I was in the queue. Oh, yeah, that's right. I am so sorry. I'm so sorry, councilmember Orion, I humbly apologize. I was forgiven. I just want to, I think, echo some sentiment that I know some of my colleagues also share. I want to thank you for the work that you all have done, specifically parking, planning to get us this far. And I also want to just make sure that, that we're clear about the conversation between like businesses and developers and what you're working on, that as you go back to make decisions and look at where there's room to negotiate, in no way, shape or form as a body is our intention to just make sure developers get everything that they want. And so please do not walk away from this conversation. I didn't say you did. I said, so please don't walk away with the notion that that's the expectation. And for our business community here today, you know, it's unreasonable to expect that no project will be impacted in the future.

So I just wanted to say that. Thank you. Thank you. Next we have councilmember Fisher. Colleagues, we probably should have concluded the public hearing first and went to discussion, but if you all don't mind, I'm going to conclude this public hearing because the speaker's list has been exhausted. Now I'm going to ask for a motion on the CB 2024 and then we can have discussions. Mister vice chair, I move for enactment of CB 2024. 2nd so there's been a motion made by council member Olson, a second made by council member Oriata to motion for enactment. Any discussion on that motion, Mister vice chair, if you, if you want to yield real fast to council member Fisher, she was in the queue. Absolutely, yes, Councilmember Fisher. And I just, I don't know if it's for, I'm sorry to maybe, maybe call you all back up because I'm just, I'm just, and I'm sorry. I was out, I was handling something and I was a little confused. So is there a caught, I guess what I'm saying is I always think it's, I'm a little confused if there's an actual codified deed that's forcing us to do this today versus, versus you all figuring out so that both parties, you know, you have time to talk, and then we have a bill one time that's at least, at least a better place versus you saying, we're going to pass this and we'll come back with an amendment or another bill. That's what I'm kind of confused about. Yes. And that's what's complicated about the state bill is that it wasn't a clean extension. They moved forward provisions that have to be effective July 1, 2024. So where in the state bill does it say July 1? I'm going to have to defer to our project manager, Megan Reiser. But it is in the state bill, because what the state bill did was it moved forth. It said certain provisions still have to be effective. And that is the no network, that is the banking provisions that the primary, the, sorry, the priority for its retention, because you need that. And so we started our bill last year after the state bill in 2023 was passed. What's the bill number? The extension is. So for clarification, what Miss Schiller is referencing is that the state bill allows for us to adopt an ordinance. However, there are provisions that became effective. And so even if we have to do retroactive cleanup with our legislation, we're still on the hook. I think that's what we were hearing from, you know, our colleague in regards to how the extension was not a clean extension. So I think we have the House bill. What was the bill? The House bill is for this year's HB 1511. And so that's where we're trying to be in an abundance of caution. We want to be able to at least start moving forward because we still have a clock ticking on certain benchmarks that we need to meet through now, through 2028. So that's where we're trying to see what we can get done, and then we can continue to work through some of those nuances. Yeah, I got it. Okay. I'm going to read the state bill real quick. Thank you. Thank you, councilmember Fisher. Now I'm going to yield to Councilmember Olson. Yes, thank you very much. And thank you, everybody who came out this, obviously, I think we've, as we can tell here, is somewhat of a confusing bill at the state level. And, you know, I feel a little bit bad because I did say that we would send this back to tie. I intended to do that to strengthen the bill. Frankly, until yesterday, I had planned to do that. But then, you know, I had these conversations with park and planning with our council as well, and, you know, did not, you know, finally then come to understand that this extension was not a clean extension at the state level and that there are compelling reasons to move forward with this. That said, I do want to continue to work on this, and Parkland Planning has committed to do that. So tae will have forest conservation in front of us to work on these issues. The grandfathering, the timeline is 2028. We do have some time. We're going to address this now, though. We're not going to kick it down the road. And I ask my colleagues to please support this, even though this is not where I thought I was even early yesterday. But sometimes we have to pivot. Sometimes we have to look at what's in front of us and the realities in front of us. And I urge, I vote on the motion. Thank you, Mister chair. I have a point of information. Sure, go ahead.

Just because, you know, I'm used to state bills. So if you go to page seven of nine, and you have to make sure if you go to the. If you go to HB 511, you don't read online the first, you have to tap in under history to the latest version. So that's after amendments and after it crosses. And that was on April 8, 2024. The bill to me. Let me go back to it. The bill to me says on or before July 1, 2025. This is 2024. So it says page, line 27. Page six out of nine. Honor. Before July 1, 2025, the Department of Natural Resource shall update the model Local Governance Ordinance required to subsection 5160, nine of the natural Histories article consistent with this act. On number 4, July 1, 2026, the Department of Natural Resources saw DOP regulations to carry out the provisions of this act. And then on page. On page seven of nine, on line 13, it says, section ten shall be further enacted. That these sections, one, two, and three of this act shall take effect July 1. They edited to 2026. 2024 is in parentheses. And then the edit says 2026. So when we're saying July 1, I just want everyone, the body to be clear. We're not talking about July 1 two months from now. We're talking about July 1, 2025. Yes or no? So what am I reading off the MGA website? Madam Fisher? I'm gonna deal to miss Zebakis first, or you want to yield to the. Go right ahead. Yes, I'm Marion honesty. I'm one of the planners. Yes. Parkland Planning Commission. The bill that you just read has multiple due dates in it. That's what adds to the confusion. There is a due date for the ordinance adoption, which the county, the state has to do the model ordinance by 2025. There's a different date for the technical manual and then there's a date for this bill. So that adds to all the confusion. Yes. Just point of a clarification in that state bill, if you could. How many due dates do we have in there? Yes. So basically what the bill did, just to clarify the bill pushed the can down, kicked the can down for all of the state requirements and then left us kind of holding the bag for the 2025 for, in order to do banking. Mister vice chair, I think this makes the point that we should move forward with this and fix things. Yeah. In the coming months. I just want to make sure I see councilmember Franklin is on screen. Councilmember Franklin, do you have any comments or questions? I was just going to say exactly what they just said. I read the state bill as well, and they do basically delay the state provisions and they're silent about what the counties have to do. And I was just going to make that same point. So we do have time. But one thing I don't have as much clarity on is the issue with banking and why we now don't have banking anymore. And maybe they can clarify why banking has paused or is not working right now. Okay. In 2020, the state, and I think it was through the attorney general, had released a decision that the retention banking was not in compliance with the state ordinance or the way it had been practiced. So they basically suspended it in 2020. And that caused a frenzy because retention banking is the more preferred use for credits to make up for woodland conservation requirements. It also caused those jurisdictions that had it to a quick drawdown of what was remaining for availability for credits. And I can say for Montgomery county, they have none. They have none. They have no banking. They are waiting. On July 1, Prince George's county has very little left because what it caused was developers to buy up the credits that they can use for their major projects. The state bill that was passed last year brought back the use of retention banking. And then last year, you know, we were preparing the bill. So in order to not impede on development projects that really do need retention banking as part of HB 1511, they pushed forward that, but they also did it with the requirement of, of establishing priority forests. So that's kind of some of the history here. I'm sorry if it was too technical. I am an environmental planner by so to do retention banking or to bring it back fully, a local jurisdiction would also have to establish priority for us. Correct. And that is one of the dates tied to the July 1, 2024. And so those dates would have to match. You couldn't do one without the other. You couldn't. Couldn't do retention banking and not do priority force at the same date. One without the other. If it's going to be banked, it has to be priority force. I see. I see. Okay. And is the priority. Is the priority force issue a part of the grandfathering debate that we're having? So that's why I said in my earlier comments that grandfathered projects would not be immediately impacted. So that time gives us time to go back and fix that grandfathering date. That is of concern. So that's a separate issue from the retention banking and the priority for us. I don't think that they expressed any concerns on the retention banking. I think the development community's concern was the grandfathering only.

I know exactly where you're going with that. And that was something I thought of, and the answer, I can't say it verbatim, but it was like it was too.

Madam Clerk, I'm going to vote aye with promises that are made by Merrill National Capitol park and planning to come back with another bill that's a little bit cleaner to address, to address the transition in grandfathering periods. I vote on do we notice her? I vote. I explain my vote. I just want to thank Councillor Councilman Austin for his leadership on this. I was just be clear, just hearing from park and planning the fact that we started, we were the ones that started on this, and I'm glad Councilman Danoga noted that we're behind and we should be the leader in the state on these issues. So if we started it, we need to finish it swiftly and whatever we could do to make this process easy, I would say let's move forward. Things are not always as clean as they should be, but in this case, if we, we should be the leader on these issues, especially these environmental issues that are very important to members in our district. So I vote on Mister Burroughs. I want to thank Councilmember Olson for his continuous leadership on these, on these issues. And I proudly vote yes. Mister Dunoga, excuse me, I just want to address, my understanding is that we are the leader in Maryland on tree conservation in the sense that we cut, we have more loss of trees than any other jurisdiction in the state. That's really not the best thing to be a leader in. So I vote aye. Hi, Madam Clerk. Sorry, I was just saying that I, well, I know how I'm going to vote, but I also, I wanted to on record have the county execs position that I didn't hear, and I feel like that's important. So I'll use my explanation of my vote to ask the county executive's position. Good afternoon, Madam Fisher. The county executive supports the planning's recommendation. We think that is the best way to move forward with this legislation at this time. As I know, the planning department has extensively worked on this legislation with Councilmember Olson, other stakeholders for about a year. So it's the best thing to move it forward at this time and any necessary amendments can be taking place if it goes back in the fall. So I will, I will vote aye. But I, you know, I don't want, I want, I want to thank council member Olson. I feel like always my, always my seat mate slash in the district maid for all his hard work and to the end, to the planning board and to the development community for working on this. I do think, though, our standard of what is complete and what we bring forward should be a little in improved if we're talking about a year and having sort of these concerns. I also, I did look through the bill and it has like several different enactment dates from July 1 all the way to 26, which I didn't see. Thanks for battle for the ending. So it is, it is confusing and I would have felt a lot more comfortable having either a legislative officer explain, like, do we have to do it today on these enactment dates, or, you know, just to be frank, we have all these folks from the county exec's office and our fuller in Annapolis, but yet I can't seem to figure out the bill. So that, that kind of makes me feel concerned. But at this moment, due to the work that's been done. I will vote aye, but it's a very slow aye. Mister Franklin? I'm gonna abstain. I just don't subscribe to the notion that we rush for russian sake, you know, unfortunately, I haven't had the opportunity to really delve into how the banking issue is intertwined with the rest of the bill. It's just legislation, so it can always be written in a way to separate the issues. I can't do that on the fly right now, but I do think there's a way to get this done right and I don't. I've not been convinced that we have to do this today, so I'm going to abstain. Thank you, Mister Hawkins. Madam Clerk, I'm not convinced by the conversation I had yesterday and the one I've heard today, so I'm voting no. Mister Olson? Aye. Miss Orrieda, my vote.

I just want to also say thank you to councilmember Olson for his leadership and learning a lot about trees. Motion carries 811. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Colleagues, as we move forward for continued public hearings, bills eligible for third reading. We're on to CB 21 2024, and this is an act concerning tree canopy coverage ordinance for the purpose of revising the existing applicability language requiring a certain grandfather provision, revising tree canopy coverage requirements, revising the credit and security requirements and adding the planning director to those that can issue waivers. This is sponsored by council members Harrison Olson, Watson, Dinogo, Oriata and Fisher. I do believe we have some speakers on CB 21 2024. Miss Janet Gingold, could you please step forward please? You have three minutes to speak. Thank you. Hi, I'm Janet Gingold and I'm speaking today on behalf of the Prince George's Sierra Club. Prince George's County Sierra Club urges you to pass CB 21 2024. This bill will reduce the area of disturbance for requiring compliance with the tree canopy ordinance from 5000 to 2500 square feet, increase the required tree canopy percentages in most zones except agricultural and certain mixed zones, and require the percentages to be met within the neck tract area. Tree canopy is important for healthy communities, especially in our more urbanized areas. As we face a future with more excess heat days, we have a tree equity problem in our county. According to the American Forest Foundation's tree equity navigator, the census blocks in Prince George's county with temperature extremes that are ten degrees higher on average have 27% less tree canopy. And while this legislation will not fix the current inequities, it will help us move in the right direction. Requiring that tree canopy percentages must be met within the net tract area is an important step forward. Trees might pull carbon out of the atmosphere wherever they are located, but for our residents to expect experience the benefits of reduced air pollution, lessened heat island effect and reduced flooding, they need trees in their neighborhood, not somewhere else. Reducing the disturbed area from 5000 to 2500 square feet will reduce the number of properties that do not have to meet these important requirements. Using net tract area to calculate the required tree canopy percentage and requiring that the requirement be met on a net tract area will result in greater tree coverage, as will increases in the percentage required in most zones. Together, these new requirements will bring us greater tree canopy to more neighborhoods in developed areas, enabling more people to experience their benefits. The Sierra Club urges the council to pass CB 21 2024. Thank you. Thank you for joining us today. Speaking. Madam Clerk, does that conclude our public speakers for on CB 21 2024? Yes, sir. Thank you, Madam Clerk, this concludes our public hearing. Is there a motion for enactment? Second, there's been a motion made by council member Olson. A second made by council member begay any discussion on that motion? Council member Franklin has. Councilmember Franklin. Thank you. Thank you, mister chair. Is parking planning still here? My question has to do with redevelopment. Does this impact the tree canopy that a project that is redeveloping, let's say, an existing shopping center, a portion of shopping center or some sort of redevelopment, does this affect those projects? Cholers? It does affect all uses because it does increase the tree canopy percentage requirements. So I do have our project manager here who can explain a little bit more in detail if you want to know what those differences are. Well, I definitely. I see the bill. So I see the various zones and that applies and kind of tentatively support it. But I recall this was an issue several years ago and we actually modified a tree canopy requirements where an applicant was coming in and was redeveloping a portion of an aging shopping center. And we made sure that the tree canopy requirements didn't apply to the whole entire shop, that they were redeveloping and there were some concerns about, you know, if you get the tree canopy percentage requirements wrong, you discourage that kind of redevelopment because they won't be able to have enough of a. Of a. Particularly a smaller redevelopment, they won't have enough of their property that it makes it a viable project. So I just want to caution us, as we reduce the size, you know, in terms of where this applies, you could potentially discourage redevelopment projects from happening. But thank you.

Colleagues, moving forward, we have CB 22 2024. This is an act concerning subdivision regulation environmental strategy area for the purpose of removing environmental strategy area from definitions and removing environmental strategy area from environmental standard and replacing it with development location and amending the required minimum stream buffer whiffs. This is sponsored by council member Harrison Olson, Watson, Fisher, done, and Burroughs. We do have a speaker for CB 22 2024, Miss Janet Gingold. Can you please step forward? You have three minutes to speak. Hi, I'm Janet Gingold, and I'm speaking today on behalf of the Prince Georgia Sierra Club. Prince George's Sierra Club supports CB 2024 and urges the council to do anything it can to make it even stronger. Regarding stream buffers. Proper stream buffers reduce erosion and pollution runoff, which helps to protect our waterways and the Chesapeake Bay. They also can reduce flooding, which helps homes and business owners, especially those downstream. They also improve wildlife habitat, and their vegetation also provides carbon sequestration. Prince George's county has major impacts on the anacostia and the patuxent, and adequate stream bumpers are essential for improving the health of these ailing waterways. Moreover, recent increased flooding and extreme precipitation events is expected, expected to become the new normal and worsen as climate change unfolds by increasing stream buffers throughout the county, except in regional transit centers. CB 2022 2024 said that wrong. CB 22 2024 takes a step in the right direction, but we think it doesn't go far enough. According to the recommendations from the United States Department of Agriculture shown in the illustration in our written testimony, the 75 foot buffers are sufficient for stabilizing stream banks and moderating water temperature however, greater stream buffer widths might be necessary for adequate nutrient removal, sediment control and flood control. Failure to provide adequate stream buffers will cause continued problems with pollution of our county waterways, the tuxent and the Anacostia and the Chesapeake. When it comes to flooding, the buffers are not adequate for the transit oriented centers and are barely sufficient for the remainder of the county. Based on this information, we urge the council to widen default stream buffer requirements to 125ft in transit oriented zones and remainder of the county to 200ft. But if this is really the best we can do, the Sierra Club supports CB 2021 and we ask you to do all you can for better street buffers. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Madam Clerk, do we have any other speakers for CB 22 2024? No, sir. That concludes the public hearing. Is there a motion for enactment? There's been a motion made by council member Olson, second by council member Fisher. Any discussion on that motion? Seeing none, Madam Clerk? Oh, Madam Clerk, please call the roll. Vice chair Harrison? Madam Clerk, I vote aye. Mister legay? Aye. Mister Burroughs? Aye. Mister Dinoga? Aye. Miss Fisher? Aye. Mister Franklin? Aye. Aye. Mister Hawkins? Madam Clerk, I vote aye. Mister Olson? Aye. Ms. Orietha? Aye. Miss Watson? Aye. Motion carries 100. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Colleagues, moving forward, under public hearings resolution eligible for final reading and adoption, we have CR 26 2024.

We are here on behalf of our Dixon crossing community. We border the mountain of Fire and Ice church and they are about to present. They're about to build a 44,000 square foot facility on the corner of Church Road. It currently has a 5000 square foot footprint and they've been good neighbors and we've been accommodating their congregation for a while. However, with a double increase of their congregation will cause a lot of road traffic noise. It's a dangerous one lane road.

The facility is in the middle of that situation and that is not being addressed at this time. The water and sewage planning, without addressing the upstream and down extreme concerns, are going to cause significant problems further down. We also see a decrease in our property values.

And I'm here on behalf of the assembly for worship request. Who was. We initially requested a change of water and sewer category from five to three. The county executive has recommended it go to four, because there may be concerns with future development and the need for a preliminary plan at that time. So we have no objections to that. This also would align it with. The church itself has two properties. One is already in water and sewer category four. This would just make it so that both of the parcels under assembly for worship's ownership were in the same water and sewer category. So with that, we just want to ask that you approve the recommended water and sewer category change for assembly for worship. Thank you. Thank you. Next we have Mister Thomas Haller. Attorney Holler, thank you for joining us today. You have three minutes to speak, sir. Thank you. Good afternoon, Mister vice chairman, members of the council. My name is Thomas Haller, with the law firm of Gibbs and Haller, with offices here in Largo. And I'm here today speaking in support of application 23 w zero four, which is referenced as 6505 Johansu Drive property. I represent the owner and the applicant in this application. The owner of the property is Meridian Hill Baptist Church. Pastor Cage is also here and will be testifying in support of the application. The applicant is Meridian Hill Partners, LLC, which is working with the church to create a retirement community on land in the Woodyard Road corridor containing about 43 acres. I'm going to keep my comments brief. I did submit written testimony in support of the application. And I would note in the record that the county executive and Parkland planning have recommended support of the change in water and sewer category from category five to category four. And so, in conclusion, we would request that the council approve the change in water and sewer category as recommended by Parkham planning and by the county executive. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you, sir. Thank you for joining us today, too, and testifying. Next we have Mister attorney Edward Gibbs. How are you? I'm great. Good. Great. Yes, good afternoon. By this time, everyone who's assembled this afternoon, and acting chair, Harrison Edward Gibbs, an attorney with offices in Largo. Very brief testimony. I'm here on one of the category change requests and CR 23. And it is designated as 23 m zero three Morton farm. Morton Farm is 85 acres located on the east side of Livingston Road, just north of its intersection with Teresa Drive in Akake. The bulk of the project was advanced into category four by CR 105 in 2021. More recently, my client acquired access to parcel 15, which is 1.39 acres. Just really a sliver. It had to be advanced into category four for sewer only. It has been recommended for approval by D PI staff, by the planning board, and by the county executive. It meets all of the criteria this is going to be a public benefit conservation subdivision and we are only at the sketch plan stage. But we need all the property in category four to follow the actual primary subdivision plan. So we would request your favorable consideration of that request. Thank you very much. Thank you Mister Gibbs for joining us. Thank you for your testimony. Next we have attorney Parker. Thank you sir. Thank you for joining us. You got three minutes to speak. Thank you very much, Mister vice chair. Thank you. And members of the county council. For the record, my name is Majette Parker, Law office of Majette S. Parker with offices in Camp Spring, Maryland. I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Mountain of Fire and Miracles ministries. And this is for water and sewer category application number 23 w zero three. Moving the water and sewer category from category five to four to allow them to proceed in the development process, land use processes. Through a preliminary plan of subdivision, detailed site plan which will come before you again, and numerous other types of approvals, we have engaged a community. We had a pre application meeting back in November 11, veterans day at the church. There's an existing church there on those acreage. What the church wants to do is expand. Build a new church, take down the old church which you heard from the previous speaker, and build a new church that can accommodate its membership. A membership. Will the sanctuary have. Sanctuary will have 800 seats. Not a huge mega church, but 800 seats. This application has been thoroughly reviewed by the. By the D PI Department of Permanent inspection and Enforcement.

And you've noticed even this morning in the. In the introductory section, there's a growing population out there that needs houses of worship of this type. Okay. Of all types.

Thank you very much, master. For the record, my name is Pastor Kuniladipo. Our church is situated at 5506 Church Road. I'm the senior pastor of mountain of fire miracles ministries, Maryland, and I'm addressing this body solely for the purpose of protecting our members to build this new house of worship at 55 OC's Church Road, Bowie, Maryland, in order to allow us to efficiently practice the doctrine of the ministry. Presently, the church, we have about 200 branches in the United States and we have. We have over 200 branches in the nice. Over 200 branches in the United States and the, and the entire world. We have been in this present location for 22 years. We actually acquired this property in year 2002. As a representative of our diverse congregation, I want to emphasize the significance of this project to our community. Presently, we have 400 members from diverse cultural backgrounds. We are not just a place of worship, but a place of transformation where lives are transformed for the better. Furthermore, we are committed to being good neighbor, responsible, steward of our environment. We urge the county, the executives to consider the importance of this project to our community and approve this change. And I would like to add this. Presently we have two full services Sunday. The reason being, because of the limitation of our present location, the size can no longer contain. Also because of that, we have to have two services every Sunday. So if we are permitted and approved to go with this new project, we will be having only one service, and that will also reduce the impact on the environment. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir, for your testimony. I see we have the project manager from the church here that would like to speak as well. You have three minutes, sir, if you could please introduce yourself.

On our team, we have elite certified that is in charge of environmental sustainability.

I have my pastor here with me as well to speak to you all this afternoon. Council members, I am Loana Aldrich from representing the people of refuge simple worship center. We are here to express gratitude, first of all for the recommendation to advance us to category four for soar. However, this was an initial request. From 2021, it has been four years. And since then, the cost of construction has significantly increased and has created more of a significant challenge for small churches. Us to move forward with the approval now to connect to public soar and move us a category four. What we are pleading today is for your support and approval to move forward with an interceptic solution that is the most cost effective and efficient approach for us to build. And it will allow our congregation to finally achieve this faithful goal that's been in works for at least 1418 years. We currently have a septic solution on the property today, and this past spring, we passed the PERC test to. With the health department's approval, we passed the PERC test that was performed by the Prince George County Health Department. And we are committed to transition to a public sewer system at the point that is available at Tippett Road. We have made ourselves familiar with the Prince George County 2035 plan and believe the vision and mission of refuse temple aligns and also complements this plan and enhances the development of PG county with a primary focus of building and developing the people. I also left additional literature with the clerk to give you more insight on the vision for this for the church, but for more importantly, solicit and urge and plead for your approval for us to move forward with an intercepted solution on the property of Tippet Road. And that's all I have. I yell my time and I have. Sir, if you can make sure that you put your name of record with the clerk. Madam Clerk. And then you'll get your three minutes to speak. Okay. Would you like to speak? No, you can speak now, but just make sure before you leave, make sure you sign up. Okay. She's basically said everything I wanted to say. We talked about it, actually. My name is Bishop James Huntley, and doctor, when I'm in this office at work, because I work for the public school system. So my name is Doctor Huntley, and we have been in operation as a church for 26 years. We bought the land, 9.5 acres of land. And at the time that we bought the land, we did have septic. We had two houses on the land. One of them unfortunately burnt down, but we still have one left. So septic was on the land. So we've been trying earnestly for years to basically build. When we bought it, we denied there was no ruling stating that we needed the sewage or the city water at the time, so we just had septic there. Since that road changed, it did complicate things for us, and that we were not able to move forward until we got an approval for you. So therefore, we do want to thank you so much for considering to move us as category forward. But as we said, we are pleading that you guys would allow us to use the interim septic. Then we will change over when it is made available. Thank you, Bishop, for your testimony. Bishop, if you can make sure you check in with Madam Clerk over there, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, sir. Next we have speaker, Mister Calvin Cage. Thank you, Mister Cage, for joining us today. Good afternoon to everyone. To vice chair to this council. I'm here on behalf of the Meridian Hill Baptist Church, 6505 Jo Hinsu drives. Working with dollar development, we decided to develop, in line with the county executives vision, to build 177 units of housing for seniors. We do know that the senior population in terms of housing is very low, as well as with veterans. But we have dedicated this property for that. Currently, we are in the category of five. We need it to be a four. Certainly, we thank you for your consideration. And as we try to go forward to do this. We could have elected to build a church, but we want to be in line with county's vision for housing. And so we dedicated our 43 acres for that. And we appreciate everything you all can do to help us make that a reality. Thank you. Thank you, sir, for your testimony today. Next we have Mister Hatcher. Mister Hatcher, please come forward. You have three minutes to speak. Thank you for joining us. Good afternoon. Acting chair and counsel for the record. My name is Chris Hatcher with Cl. Hatcher with office and Laurel.

Director Xvelia from the Department of Housing and Community Development explained that the action plan is updated yearly according to the funds received from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. She also explained that the agency has not received the final funding allocations for this year and that they will send a revised prorated adjustment when the funding is received. There was a discussion on why the neighborhood Design center did not receive funding this year. After the discussion, chair Ivy and Council member Olson encouraged continued conversations with the Neighborhood Design center to help the organization understand program requirements. The Office of Audits and Investigations indicated that the resolution aligns with plan 2035 goals to prioritize affordable housing and economic development, rental assistance, as well as homeowners assistance.

Cr 40 24 is the final step in the process in subtitle 29 of your county code that allows for your consideration and adoption of proposals to designate certain properties in the county as historic sites. That authority derives from the land use article of the state law. And as you recall, we had a committee of the whole last week on April 30 in which we went over the transcript analysis and the digestive testimony received received in the joint public hearing record of testimony concerning the proposed designation of the three gross houses that are located within the councilmatic district three. So, upon hearing the planning board's recommendation on it, which was to approve or they recommended approval of the proposed designations, the committee of the whole made a motion by councilmember Olson and duly seconded to direct staff, that's me. To prepare a resolution of approval for the designation, which is the final step. So that is the resolution before you, and it is poised for final action should you decide to suspend the rules and move to adopt. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Cevacus, for the overview.

Wait, I thought we were doing committee at home. Oh, can we. Can we do it now? We have reconvened as county council second reading of Bill CB 12 20 24, an act concerning procurement practices, revisions for the purpose of amending provisions of subtitle ten a regarding administrative procedures, awards of contracts and economic development generally relating to procurement. Subject to subtitle Ten A, we turn to council chair, the GOFP chair. Councilmember Watson. Sorry. Thank you. The Prince George's counties government and Operations and Fiscal Policy Committee convened on April 11, 2024 to consider CB 12 20 24, an act concerning procurement practices and revisions for the purpose of amending provisions of subtitle ten a regarding administrative procedures, award of contracts and economic development generally relating to procurements subject to subtitle ten a. During the committee session, Secinda Skinner, County Council liaison offers of the county executive, introduced the other executive branch staff present, which included chief administrative officer Tara Jackson, office of Central Services Director Jonathan Butler and Pam Dickerson, deputy director. Director Butler explained that the proposed legislation establishes two additional exemptions from procurement practices. The bill eliminates the business development reserve program and replaces it with the implementation of the supply schedule. This legislation creates a two year period during which certifications remain valid. Finally, the bill lowers the county based small business percentage bid discount to 12% from 15%. The goal of the changes to the bid structure is to develop the minority business enterprises in the county more effectively. However, despite the lower percentage, the hierarchy remains, with county based MBE's receiving the highest percentage county based minority business enterprise 15% county based small businesses 12% county based businesses 10% minority business enterprise or disadvantaged business enterprise, 5% and county located business, 3%. After further discussion of the rationale for the bid discount, additional exemptions and technical amendments, the GOFP committee voted favorably 30 one that concludes my report. Are there any sponsors? Sponsors Council members Hawkins, Franklin and Watson thank you. CB 12 20 24 Stance introduced next we have CB 27 2024, an act concerning transitional provisions except extension of time for access to prior subdivision regulations for the purpose of amending the time for applications to be approved and considered under the prior subdivision regulations from two years to four years or from April 1, 2024 to April 1, 2025. This is introduced by council member Ivy and on April 18, planning, Housing and Economic Development committee favorably recommended it to the county council. Is Mister Durnoga going to give a committee reporter, the county council's acting associate county administrator, clarify that CB 22 2024 is a subdivision bill and a zoning bill is not needed to vote on CB 27 2024. After additional discussion, the committee voted three two on CB 27 2024 favorably. Thank you. Are there any additional sponsors? Additional sponsor council member Hawkins, council member Franklin as well. Thank you. CB 27 stands introduced.

Thank you for the opportunity. Thank you Mister Washington. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for having me and thanks for the consideration. Good afternoon all. My name is Edward Troy Washington. I'm honored to be here to go in front of you to hopefully join the revenue accounting board. What am I going to bring to the table? I've had 36 years of experience in the financial markets, just overall and various diverse different types of organizations. I've worked for big companies with Johnson and Johnson. I've worked with larger nonprofit companies, Brookings Institute, small companies. As she mentioned, Miss Brewer mentioned Whitman Walker, as well as my current position at AUCD, the Association of University Centers on Disabilities. In those positions, I've held all kinds of roles from, of course, mostly financial base, from accountant to senior accountant director of finance. I've been executive director also in my current position as chief financial and operating officer for AUCD. My responsibilities now span many different areas, financial, of course, contractual, federal, grant compliance, human resources, as well as all types of operations. I think my past experience will provide me a solid base. Has provided me a solid base to understand business just overall. It helped me understand oversight, strategic guidance, organizational structure, support, adhering to and enhancing mission, vision, administrative and fiscal policies and procedures, and maintaining long term viability for different organizations. I think my asset, all my experience, will definitely be an asset to the board. My degrees as well will help me. My favorite degree, of course, being accounting from the Rio Hu is my number one degree, as well as my master's in public administration from Rutgers University, as well as my JD. My Juris doctorate in law has also helped pretty much put me on my path as well as will help the board overall. Finally, I think I'm suitable for the board just because I care. I care about my county. I've been here 17 years and finally stepping up and saying, you know what, I want to step up and actually serve and help. Just overall, I'm very interested in it. I'm a native from New Jersey originally. I'm originally from Atlantic City, New Jersey before the casinos, and I've moved from New Jersey and I moved to Maryland and I've been in Beltsville for 17 years, so. And finally, I just want to say I understand trying to. It's hard to get people to actively serve and get on boards. I have a board and I've been reporting to boards for most of my career. I've also been on a board. I was at Irvington Housing Authority board about 20 plus years ago. So I'm dating myself. So I know it's hard to get people to actively get and sit on boards. I'm glad to be here and hope to be approved. So thanks again for the consideration. I also want to thank Miss Brewer for shepherding us through this process thus far. So thank you. Thank you. Thanks to you both for stepping up to serve. Do my colleagues have any questions? Hearing none, mister vice chair. Thank you. Madam chair, I'd like to make a motion to move favorable on the nominee. Second. It has been moved and seconded to move favorable. Madam clerk, please call the roll. Madam chair. Aye. Vice chair, vote aye and explain my vote.

We will now move to our first piece of legislation, Cr 1220 24, a resolution concerning the county procurement regulations work group. We'll start with an overview from Mister Tutt. Thank you, madam chair. Cr 12 20 24 is a resolution that would establish a workgroup to review, analyze and evaluate county procurement regulations and recommend updates. The last comprehensive update of the code took place in 1992 as a result of us Supreme Court action in a case involving the city of Richmond requiring local governments to have a factual basis for preference programs. Cr four in 1992 adopted the disparity study associated and summarizes the evidence of discrimination and set a goal of 30% for MBE's, although a significant amount of work was done in 2016 and 2017 via CB 74 and CB 115 respectively, and at a few other points in time, as described in the policy analysis document that you received. And Mister Stover is here if you have any questions about that document. The regulations the procurement regulations workgroup would be composed of seven members. One member appointed by the county council chair, one member appointed by the county executive, a representative from the Office of Central Services, from the Office of Finance, Public Works, the police department and the fire department. A report that summarizes the actions of the workgroup, including analysis and recommendations for improvements to the current procurement regulations and requirements, will be required six months after the work group begins its work. And with that, thank you very much, Mister Tutt. Are there any comments from office of law? No. All right. Good afternoon, madam Chair. Thank you. Good afternoon to all committee members. We have had the opportunity to review Cr twelve and find it to be in proper legislative form and legally sufficient. Thank you very much, Miss Bell. Our county executive Lee's on, Miss Skinner. Thank you, chair Watson. And good afternoon, committee members. The county executive does support CR 12, 20, 24. There were some, I think, friendly amendments. I had an opportunity to speak with the bill sponsor. I know he's not here right now. I didn't know if Miss Dickerson wanted to highlight those friendly amendments, or. If you want me to, I can. Okay. So we're asking to replace office of Central Services with a procurement officer with Prince George's county purchasing agent or their designee. The second friendly amendment would be replace representatives from police department and fire EMS department with representatives from Office of Law and Office of Information Technology. And the last amendment is recommending. We recommend extending the final report presentation from six months to nine months and recommend meetings be on a monthly basis if a final report is due within that six month period. And that is it. Thank you. Our sponsor is not here. Are there any questions from our committee members? Any questions? Councilman Moriarta? Well, I don't have a question per se, but I was just wondering if we, as a committee, could entertain another friendly amendment. Just when I think about the intention of the resolution around what we could do better around procurement and who's here, would it be beneficial for us to have someone from the business community, not just have agencies, so maybe another designee by the chair of the council, but specifying that they are a business that does business with the county for that outside perspective. Mister Butler? Yeah. Good afternoon, madam chair. Mister vice chair. Member of the committee. Yeah, that's an interesting suggestion. As a matter of fact, it does have some merit to it, I think, if you're going to look at it holistically in terms of making revisions or productive changes to the code, so certainly good to have a business perspective as well. Agreed. Thank you. Any other comments? Questions? All right. Is there a motion I'd like to make? Motion to move favorable with amendments. It has been moved and seconded to move favorable with amendments. Please call the roll. Madam Chair. Aye. Vice Chair Harrison? I vote aye. Mister Durnoga? Aye. Miss Oriata? Aye. Motion carries, 40. Thank you. We'll now move to our next agenda item, CB 25, 2024. Executive order number 220 24, reorganizational proposal. Mister Tuck will now provide an overview. Thank you, madam Chair. The county executive's office transmitted the next two items on the agenda. First is CB 25, which is the vehicle for executive order number 220 24, a reorganizational proposal creating an office of procurement and transferring the procurement related functions to the new department.

The legislation was presented on March 19 of this year and has a 60 day deadline for council action, which is May 3. Pursuant to charter section 503, this proposal will become effective under, unless disapproved by a majority vote of the full council. The legislation is a companion, as I mentioned, to the next item, CB 24, which is largely revisions, just changing the name of the well, removing the Director of Central services and replacing that with the new title for the procurement officer, and with that completes my overview.

Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Office of Law. Any comments? Thank you, madam Chair. I have no additional comments. We had the opportunity to work with the office of Central Service on this. Thank you. All right, Miss Skinner. Thank you, madam Chair. We are looking forward to the council's support regarding CB 25 2024 and essentially CB 24 2024. We are joined here with OCS Office of Central Services director Jonathan Butler and Pamela Dickerson, our deputy director of procurement, supplier Diversity and compliance. Great. Mister Butler, would you like to make some comments? Sure, yeah. This is probably one of my favorite bills here. It's actually, it started off as if I remember, it started off as a discussion between myself, himself and the DCO at the time, Tara Jackson. And, you know, when you think about procurement, procurement is really one of the most important functions, I think of any government. It is really how agencies go about in terms of acquiring resources, expertise, goods and services to really help meet their mission, so to speak. You know, without procurement, I think one would note that a government cannot effectively serve its citizens. You know, when you think about trash removal, when you think about snow removal, public works, repairs to roadways and bridges, as well as building construction, all of that is done through contracting and procurement. The other thing, when you look at the way procurement is set up now in Prince George's county, it is really a small division that's buried in a department of general services type agency in adjacent with other things such as real estate, facility operations, capital construction, fleet and warehousing. So what we're looking to do here was to really be truly effective and to align the establishment of a new office of procurement with best practices throughout the jurisdictions, particularly to actually elevate the profile for procurement in the county and then to properly resource it going forward, and also to establish true, really, leadership that is dedicated and solely focused on timely and cost effective acquisition of goods and services for well over 30 agencies. So for all of those reasons, we need to establish the office of Procurement. Thank you and welcome, Miss Dickerson. Good to see you. Thank you. Are there any questions for my colleagues, councilmember Orianna, just to get clarity, would create an entirely different division from your office and move all the responsibilities over. And I apologize. I don't remember seeing the fiscal note for creating the new division. Well, it's actually a new agency. A new agency if someone has it. Yep. And actually the fiscal impact is pretty much neutral because it's actually coming out of the office of Central Services. So where we were supporting that function within the office of central Services, we're simply carving out the staff and budget to now create the new office of Procurement. So it creates no new positions? Well, we're going to be asking for a couple additional positions in order to properly resource it as a new agency. Yeah, but for the most part, the bulk of the resources are going to be coming from the office of Central Services with the existing staff. How many new positions? What are we thinking from a cost perspective? We can follow up on that. Yeah. So it's my understanding the new office of Procurement has taken the same budget that Office of Central Services has received for fiscal year 25. So the proposed or the executive's budget presentation that you provided before yourself and your colleagues, that was noted in that meeting. So it's within Office of Central Services Budget? My understanding. And the estimate, you know, the estimate. And correct me if I'm miss. If I'm misspeaking here, but I believe it's going to be a little over 1 million to add to three positions, contracts for training, fringe benefits, and upgraded licenses for teams. So the amount coming out of the office of Central Services budget is roughly 5.6 million. Again, that's been provided to you all from the executive's presentation that she presented to you. All the enhancement is just $1 million, if that's right. So it'll cost essentially the 1 million to set up the state of the art office of procurement. Well, I'll just say this. I'm gonna know my colleagues gonna go next. I know just 1 million, but I know some of my colleagues are trying to get other things that are efficient and they're being told, like, a million is a lot and something that they can't move forward. So I just want us to be mindful of, like, does this really make sense? Is this going to yield us the best result? Is this the best use of our funding? Because, you know, when we're trying to do, like, $250,000 for returning citizens and recidivism rate, I mean, that's. We're not funding that, you know, but a million dollars for just a restructure. So that's just something for us to think about. If we have a tight budget, there's a lot we want to do.

But thank you, Mister vice chair. Thank you. Just point of clarification, I remember that in the budget presentation, and you're transferring. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it was 36 positions that are transferring to procurement and then three additional. Yes, that's correct. Yes. Okay. See, my memory is not all that bad. So basically, we're only talking about three positions. Right. And the million dollars, where did that figure come from? Like, what is that broken down? I don't remember the breakdown of that. Good afternoon, vice chair and madam chair. I'm Pamela Dickerson. I feel like I'm speaking differently. The three positions are for the director, also for a new associate director, as well as a staff for human resources. And also just to add a little bit as it relates to your concerns for procurement. The purpose of procurement is to actually protect the county's purse. So when you have a good staff of procurement professionals who is able to look at your budget and be able to examine and look at those contracts and finances, we should be able to find cost savings instead of the extra fat that's out there that we're looking for to actually save money for the county. So in a sense, the million dollars could actually be a cost savings to the county, as well as when we hire these professionals, they should be able to go in and do audits and check and find extra dollars for whatever the county is seeking. That is the hope and the goal of the new agency. And just to also, I understand there's some training included in that as well. Lots of training. We are, as of right now, within ocs, we have procurement 101 scope of work training, as well as comprehensive pcard training and contract administration training that will happen between April and June of this year for everyone in the county that touches procurement. Coming in just in July, we realized that we're infants in procurement in the county. And so if we're able to go in and show everyone what is procurement and demystify it, maybe that will help us to see what we should be doing, what we should not be doing, and also to just wheel in that money train that we sort of see sometimes so that there is someone that's held accountable and most importantly, an agency that is dedicated to training and advocacy for our small business owners. Thank you. Miss Dickerson, chair Ivey had a question. Yes, thank you so much. I was thinking about how the Supreme Court has not been on our side when it comes to minority anything. And I'm wondering if there's a way that this office could do the work of getting businesses, getting minority businesses to get more of the county's money while keeping it out of the hands of the Supreme Court. We have been looking closely at what's going on on a federal level, and we're actually looking at how to sort of circumvent if it did come down on a county level, because pretty soon things will sort of get shaken up. So it is the goal, and I'm teaching the team to start seeing how we can think outside of the box. So to your point, it will be the responsibility of this agency to not only get those dollars there, but through good legislation, we will be able to get everything to the pockets of small businesses. I think just last week we had over 100 small businesses for the supply schedule, which should be the first resort for purchasing. But I don't think a lot of folks here in the county actually know that you're supposed to go to this supply schedule first. So if we go there, they're all county based small businesses as well as certified businesses. If we're doing our purchasing through that list only, we would be spending millions on small businesses direct impact to our economy. So we're working on it, and hopefully through our advocacy and ensuring from cradle to grave type contracting, that we will be able to follow each company as they go through a streamlined process that we're creating. I see. And I'm assuming when you say small businesses in Prince George's county, is that the majority of them, are they african american or other minorities? I don't mean white women. Not white women. Well, I mean, they're considered for the MBE program. And then we also have subcontracting requirements. So outside of the goals, there are also sub goals that are within the contracts as well. So that we are making sure that we are reaching out. And so another thing that we have started is when we do see that we are waiving certain commodities, we are going out and directly contacting those vendors to say, hey, we need for you to come in and get certified. And we are getting them certified very quickly if they have all the proper documentation within three days. And we're actually utilizing those businesses, too. So I did also want to know, would this make us an outlier in the region or do, or are we an outlier now because we don't have a procurement office? Yeah, no, t", "esg_v1": [{"name": "New Procurement Office", "insights": [{"observation": "The setup of the state-of-the-art office of procurement will cost 1 million dollars.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There are some concerns about the worth and efficiency of spending 1 million dollars on the office of procurement compared to other needs like funding for returning citizens and recidivism rates.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The purpose of procurement is to protect the county\u2019s budget by finding cost savings.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The procurement office will include training, such as procurement 101, scope of work training, comprehensive pcard training, and contract administration training, to educate county employees.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The new agency aims to establish accountability and enhance training and advocacy for small business owners.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The office is looking at ways to support minority businesses and increase their share of the county\u2019s contracts.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There will be efforts to get more contracts to county-based small businesses, which should have a direct positive impact on the local economy.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Efforts are being made to ensure that small businesses, especially minority-owned, are getting certified quickly and utilized for county contracts.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Concerns that the majority of small businesses in the procurement program should be African American or other minorities, excluding white women.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Proactive outreach to vendors to get them certified and involved in county contracts.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "New Procurement Office", "insights": [{"observation": "The setup of the state-of-the-art office of procurement will cost 1 million dollars.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There are some concerns about the worth and efficiency of spending 1 million dollars on the office of procurement compared to other needs like funding for returning citizens and recidivism rates.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The purpose of procurement is to protect the county\u2019s budget by finding cost savings.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The procurement office will include training, such as procurement 101, scope of work training, comprehensive pcard training, and contract administration training, to educate county employees.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The new agency aims to establish accountability and enhance training and advocacy for small business owners.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The office is looking at ways to support minority businesses and increase their share of the county\u2019s contracts.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There will be efforts to get more contracts to county-based small businesses, which should have a direct positive impact on the local economy.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Efforts are being made to ensure that small businesses, especially minority-owned, are getting certified quickly and utilized for county contracts.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Concerns that the majority of small businesses in the procurement program should be African American or other minorities, excluding white women.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Proactive outreach to vendors to get them certified and involved in county contracts.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1397982, "chunk_end_time": 1847236, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3449?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3449?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=1397"}, {"start": 24000, "end": 30000, "text": "t we're creating.

And that is where we are now when you start looking at the volume of work and dollars that come through procurement. So, yeah, it's a best practice. So I'm assuming that having this as a separate agency would help you specialize more. Okay. And how long, assuming it passes, how long would it take for. For you to be up and running? Well, I think that's actually instant on day 1. July 1. Yeah, we. I came into the county July 1 and we have been running. We are building the tracks and the train and the workers are working and the ball is continuously rolling. We are hiring awesome and excellent smart staff and we are doing the business of the county, but we can't do everything until we do become the office of procurement so that we are able to streamline and do all the things that's in this legislation, but we are rolling. And my last question, what metrics will you be using to show success? We're not success. Our cap director is here, and that's the first question he asked when we hired him. The biggest thing that we're going to do is my first goal is to cut down waivers. Here in the county, we have lots of waivers. That's one of our biggest goals of success, to see that we are actually being transparent with our procurements. We are out there and doing the advocacy and the business of the county, but most importantly, conducting solicitations and not assuming that there's only one source, that we're giving everyone an opportunity to play in an equal playing field. So from cradle to grave, we have looked at different roles within our SD three unit. We have moved someone over so that she is solely responsible for advocacy. So when you come in, this person is introducing themselves and giving good customer service and ensuring, if you need something, we're going to be there. If you didn't get a contract, why didn't you have that? We're going to have debriefings, just the general procurement items that could be done if we had that focus on procurement here in the county. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Durnoga. Oh, we'll go to Miss Ariata first. Thank you. Yeah, I think that I have still some reservations with a few things like one, when we talk about the position. So I'm hearing that majority of the positions are just rolling over. Right. They exist. And so we're spending the money on hiring a director. Right. So then we're spending the money on, like, high level bureaucratic positions, and majority of the staff that do the work already exist. I'm just having, like, a tension point with why can't the staff that already exist do this work as a division under central services? Why do we need to hire, like, more high level positions? So I have a tension point with that. And then also, so I guess there's been a lot that has been presented around procurement and, you know, this focus on MB that has already happened through central services. So, I mean, is that not working? Is that what we're saying, that it's not what has been presented before us, it's not working. So we need to do it differently. And I guess the third point .2 is that I feel like we have this work group that is forming that's supposed to be around procurement practices and, like, ideas and thoughts on how we can do that better. And it feels a little bit, you know, carp before the horse. I know sometimes when I'm asked to do a work group first, you know, let's think about it. Let's figure out the structure. So it seems like we're doing both. Like, wouldn't it be beneficial to allow that group to, if we did decide we want to go down this pathway to figure out how to structure this new division instead of maybe recommendations come out and then we have to restructure it. And then my last point I'll say is I just really do have tension point with how we invest money. Like, if we, on the days I know some of my colleagues that got pushed back on positions and the cost of things and then $1 million more, and it's not to create the staff to actually do the job, it's to create director positions. I have. That's just a tension point for that. Yeah. Let me just try to weigh in on some of that. I think, councilmember, you asked a couple of things. I think with regards to structure, in any agency, there's a director, so you gotta have a director and certainly possibly a deputy director for any agency. No, I agree with that. I'm saying I don't think we need to just basically shift up all the positions and hire. So what are we doing other than hiring a director and a deputy? I agree.

I'm saying I don't think we need to just basically shift up all the positions and hire. So what are we doing other than hiring a director and a deputy? I agree. If we created an agency, we have to do it. What I'm saying is that's all we're doing. You're saying you're not creating more staff that actually do the work. When we ask what are the three positions, it's a director and a deputy director and that everyone else is already hired that's doing the work, are you asking about just sort of the fiscal impact here? Is that more so where you're getting to or just the structure? Because I think we're talking about only three positions to be added to this new agency. Right. I agree with that. That's what I'm hearing. So that's where my confusion comes in. Why? If you're saying right now, currently, but all the staffing that is needed to do this work exists currently within the agency and that all you need to do is move over all the people that are doing the work and then hire a director and a deputy director, that's where my attention point comes. I could understand if you said to me that we need a completely different agency. We don't have people that do this type of tangible, on the ground work that needs to be done and we need to hire them because there's a hole with the actual work. But you're saying there's not a hole with actual work. You just want to hire a director and a deputy director to direct the people that already do the work. So we're currently hiring staff now. We have hired a new division manager who has a procurement background, also an attorney. They have hired me. I have a Masters in public procurement as well as over 20 years of experience. We are hopefully about to hire a new executive director who will come in also with procurement experience as well. Our procurement staff, they are also coming in with procurement background that can do cradle to grave procurements as well. So we are currently hiring the staff to fill the positions for the agency that have not been filled before. But we're doing it a little differently as it relates to, as it relates to ensuring that the folks that are being hired are procurement professionals. We do have them right now, but no, it can't work within, as the director said, in an office that is sort of like a GSA for government, you've pinned procurement into this section and it doesn't get the quality that it needs. So by pulling it out as best practices and other jurisdictions and municipalities, we're no longer behaving as if we are a Peacock county. We are behaving as if we are spending millions, hundreds of millions of dollars because we are. So we need professionals who can do auditing, who understands policy, who understands procurement and cradle to grave procurement so that we can save the money that you're looking for the county to save. So we're sort of already, we're putting the cart and everything together right now. So on July 1, we will not be looking around like, what does this agency do? What's your mission? What's your goal? We're already putting in the work. Yeah, I hear what you're saying. I guess I would say, still say that I fundamentally believe, like, if we're saying that we're putting a work group to figure out how we can change the procurement practices and what we should do differently, it would just make sense to me that we see what comes out of that to then structure the agency around that. But you know, I'm just one vote, one opinion, but I just fundamentally think that if, what's the point? Like what's the point of asking for the input of the structure and how we're going to do things if we're just going to create the structure now? But that's just my point. I yield the floor back to the chair. Thank you, Mister Dunoga. And then we'll go to vice chair. And chair. I. So what I'm hearing you say is you've already, already have selected the staff, the directing staff. Somebody has. So we're building a car, not the director or anything in that notion, but some of the staff to begin to make up the actual office of procurement. Yeah, but we already, I know this was mentioned, but let me be clear. We're moving 30 some people or positions over. Correct. And so those are a combination of procurement staff as well as supply development and diversity and compliance staff. So it's not, and this is a consolidated agency that will support those three functions. Okay, so we're moving 36 positions. How many of those people, how many positions are filled? We're in the process of filling several, I think, where we have at least a couple of three. Three, maybe three procurement officers to field at the moment. So there are still a couple of vacancies that we're in the process of doing. All right. So then we're going to bring in two management level people and a human resources person. But it sounds like you've already, maybe not you, but maybe Miss Skinner has those top level people already pegged out. Because if we're supposed to hit the ground running on July 1 and it's April 1, we already know who these people are. That's a question that I don't have an answer to.

I think some of that is training as well as comp. You want to talk a little bit about the training? Yes. So the proposal has 374. It may have changed a little bit. Thousand. For SLP development. We are also revamping our speed, the speed procurement system that we have. So we also need training for Ariba and for the purchase card electric system that we need to implement for the county. We also have the positions that have been approved by budget, which is the director, associate director and a human resources analyst, as well as the fringe benefits. So just on that note, I'll be done. So you don't need to go on because I'll keep it short. Can you provide us with the salary and the compensation and benefits for each of those three positions or what the salary ranges are for each of those three positions? Yes, that would be good to know because this is a. It's budget season. You might as well know what we're looking at. Okay, that's all I had. Thank you. All right, mister vice chair. Thank you, madam chair. I just want to first thank the office of Central Services and Miss Dickerson and director Butler for presenting. I see that you all are reading from some information that we necessarily don't have in front of us. If it's possible, if we could get that breakdown from what you are reading, maybe an organizational flowchart would help as well, and how that would operate. That agency would operate to its fullness. We'd be grateful to be a part of the information that we receive. Also the breakdown of the 36 employees that are being transferred, how you simulate that to be an organizational flow, and then, of course, the breakdown of the million dollars and how that is broken down. The one question that was asked by Mister Dunoga, if this is going to be implemented by July 1, you know, we have an employment law that we got to post position. So has there been a position posted for about this directorship? Well, I think for many of the merit positions, certainly they have been advertised and we're going through the hiring process. The director position, I believe, is an appointed position, and that would be at the discretion, I believe, of the county executive. Okay. So if we could just get an update of where we are in that process, that would be great. The more information that we have, I think the more educated decision that we can make here today. I see what you all are reading from, but if I can't kind of look at it make sense kind of a picture person. So thank you. Fair enough, sir. Thank you, madam chair. Ivey and then we'll go to Mister Franklin. Okay, yeah, sorry, Mister Franklin. I'll go ahead and bump ahead of you, even though I know I shouldn't, but I'm just unclear about one thing. We asked about the fiscal note. I'm actually being bad. I'm just now reading the fiscal note, but the one I have before me says that it would be cheaper, it would be $150,100 less expensive to do it. So I don't know where the million dollars is coming from, because at least your budget in 2024 was 32,186,300, and the proposed budget looks like for 2025, you took it down to 25,000,259,000. And then the Office of Procurement Budget is 6,777,200. And the difference between the two is $150,000. So where did the million come from? I think we need to follow up. I think maybe if you. I don't have it in front of me, but if you're looking at sort of the overall change with OCS versus, you know, looking at 2025 and 2024, and that overall savings of the agency, that would include taking out or setting up the new office of Procurement, if I remember the numbers, I think that's how that savings is calculated, because there are some other adjustments coming out of Ocs that's not procurement related, that also will need to address some savings in order to meet budget requirements. Okay. And my last comment, for real, is just that the work group is something that is coming from a council member, and the office of Procurement is something that's coming from the county executive. So it's not that I think things were happening maybe at the same time, and I don't think that there was any kind of coordination. I mean, obviously, if a council member wants to look into something, they can do so. But that doesn't mean that it was at the request of the county executive. So, in any event, I was just noting that the things aren't in conflict necessarily. They just were not coordinated. Anyway, that's it. Very well. Thank you. And just with the particular comment on the work group, certainly supportive of the workgroup, and when I think of the work group, I think of a body of individuals that's looking at how to modernize the procurement code, how to make transactions easier, how to make things a bit more streamlined, and how to insert best practices when it comes to how we do business as an agency.

So, yeah, thank you. Mister Franklin had a comment. Mister Franklin? Yes, thank you. And thank you, Mister Butler and your team wanted to follow up on some of the things my colleagues asked about. Unfortunately, my audio wasn't working for much of the discussion, but I'll try not go back over things that you have already covered. So, in terms of the functions of supplier diversity, I want to ask about SDDD, which is supplier development diversity division. That's going to be a part of this office of procurement, correct? That is correct. Now, was there some thought, given that the supplier diversity and development division should be under a different agency office than the procurement functions, since SDD kind of is supposed to hold procurement accountable for supplier diversity requirements and meeting them and waivers and things of that nature? I'll let Pamela also shed some light on this as well. But when I think of SD three, I think, as you know, councilmember, there is a great deal of connective tissue between small and minority business contracting and the Office of Procurement. Really, this is how we continue to develop, grow and invest in our small and minority businesses through contracting and procurement. So what better adjacency to actually now have SD three truly tied to contracting and procurement? So we know instantly whenever there is an opportunity. We also know the capacity and capability and availability of firms to do the business right there in the same office. So that's where I see that being very advantageous. And I would like to add, whenever you guys receive the chart, you will see that SD three and compliance have been placed within the Office of Accountability within this new office. If it is approved within the Office of Accountability, it will be dedicated to fostering the development, economic growth and retention of county based businesses while actively promoting economic development throughout the county and commercial corridors, this office will hold a critical responsibility of ensuring compliance for the government as it relates to socioeconomic laws, programs and policies. While it could be seen that SD three should be separate, since being under my leadership, we are working together cohesively to ensure that we are all working together for the complete lifecycle of procurement. So, as the primary advocate for local, small and disadvantaged and minority veteran owned businesses, what we have done is we are working together with all managers within the office of Procurement to ensure that if CAP is doing something, SD three knows those hot button items. If the compliance unit needs to look at procurement or subcontracting plans. They are all working cohesively as one unit and one team. And we have found that by doing this, we're now streamlining our processes. The application process will be very easy for our vendors because cap and SD three are talking to each other now. Before they were siloed. So now, from cradle to grave, from the time that we do an outreach project until we see that a vendor has been awarded, we have folks implementing in between that process now, unlike how it was before. So while it seems like they should hold, sorry, contracts and procurement accountable, now, we are ensuring that they are through the Office of Accountability. Before it was not being done, today it is. We're ensuring that we are enacting upon the rules and regulations of the county through compliance, supplier diversity, and working closely with cap. Now I understand. Well, my hope is, if this goes forward, that the Office of accountability within the office of Procurement will feel independent enough that they can actually tell the procurement folks things they don't want to hear, or tell them things that aren't going well. Because that's the concern I hear from someone in the minority business community, is that they wonder, is SDDD not just a rubber stamp, or are they really trying to hold those who are doing the procurements accountable for making sure that the requirements and goals are being met for our small minority business community? So my hope is that, you know, SDD and compliance will feel that level of independence that they can actually hold. You know, they can actually do their jobs. I did want to also ask, who is going to do certifications? Is that still SDDD? Yes. Okay. So they won't do the certification process. Okay. And have you found that the certification process has improved in recent times?

So my hope is that, you know, SDD and compliance will feel that level of independence that they can actually hold. You know, they can actually do their jobs. I did want to also ask, who is going to do certifications? Is that still SDDD? Yes. Okay. So they won't do the certification process. Okay. And have you found that the certification process has improved in recent times? We are improving the process as new vendors are registering, we are seeing that the application process is cumbersome, so we are streamlining it to make it. I think I tell the team, I need one click, as few clicks as we can get. Vendors should not have to go out and find this and that and understand the difference between a registration and a certification. They should know that this is where I go, this is where I click, here are the documents to upload and it should be streamlined. So we're working with the team and our business partners to ensure that that process is easier. We are also ensuring that when we see applications stuck in the process, we're actually calling them now and reaching out instead of allowing us system to send an email saying, you're going to be canceled in two days if you don't complete your application. So we're learning customer service. We are learning how to streamline the process and also how to make it easier for our business partners to become certified. And you know, a lot of businesses come with existing MBE certifications from the state, for example. I'm still getting some feedback that they still feel like they are having to do a lot of paperwork at the county level, even though they are. A lot of. It's duplicative. Is that something that you've looked at recently? Is that something you've heard about? It is, and it will be my goal working with you because I think maybe it is actually code. So we need to see what is actually law and what's not before I start tinkling with the application process. But I feel that if you've already gone through those processes along with the other reciprocal programs, you should not have to resubmit that information. You should just upload it, check the box, and then our team should look at it and certify that it should be very simple. Yeah. And there are laws in place, I think, in the code that say that. Basically say what you just said, which is that you already have one in certification. As long as you prove that you're local, you should be recognized as county based small relatively quickly. I don't know how it's happening in practice, but there's already a size test in the MBE standard for the state. So it's really just a question of locality where you based of. And once you establish that, it should be a simple matter, but that's definitely something hopefully you can look further into that will be changed before the beginning of the year if it's within my capacity to change that quickly. Got it. Okay. That's all I had. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, madam chair. Thank you, Mister Franklin. I understand. Miss Skinner, did you have something you wanted to share? Thank you, madam chair. So I know that there was a litany of items that the committee wanted us to look into in the event that this legislation was held. So I wanted to make sure I had the list accurate, a $1 million breakdown, the compensation and salary of the three new positions, and the chart. But I would actually ask if you haven't already looked at the budget summary on page 244 through page 251. It actually answers a lot of that. And so if you have any other specific questions, please email me or whatnot, and I'll get that to you. Thank you, Mister vice chair. Miss Skinner. So you can you get us the information of the organizational flow chart as well? All that. The flow chart or the chart? The chart. Okay. Any other questions? Is there a motion? Yes, madam Chair. I would like to make a motion to hold, but to bring it back to the next committee work session. It allows us more time to kind of look at the information and then be able to take some action on that day. So I'd like to make a motion to hold. It has been moved and seconded that we hold.

Cross 15, 2024 resolution concerning supplemental supplementary appropriation of federal, state and other funds. I'll turn to Mister Tutt for an overview. Thank you, madam Chair. And yes, this is the final piece of legislation on the agenda. Cr 15 2024 is a resolution for appropriating funding from grants for six agencies in the amount of $13,291,000 for fiscal year 2024. The agencies receiving funding would be the police department, the Department of Family Services, the health department, the Department of Public Works and Transportation, the Department of Housing and Community Development, and the Department of the Environment. The amounts range from $619 for the Department of Family Services for senior center support to $8 million for the Department of Environment for reforestation and creek reforestation. A full list with details is included and is attached to the legislation. Thank you, madam chair. Thank you, Mister Tutt. I'd like to hear now from our policy group if there are any questions or concerns or comment. Madam Chair, I should note that there is a draft two that we received that was emailed to the committee and I presented hard copies earlier, and I believe Miss Skinner is available to review the changes from. I'm sorry, excuse me. We also have from the Office of Management and Budget a representative that can go over the changes in draft two. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, please. Good afternoon, madam chair, members of the GOFP committee. My name is Roger Benegas and CR 15 is a supplemental appropriation from grant funds in the amount of 13,291,486 to be approved in the current year's approved budget. County agencies will use these appropriations to provide enhanced service delivery and additional support and critical service areas. The total adjustments to the amount of outside source funding and federal programs is again 13,291,486. 9,551,710 are in state and other funding and 3,739,776 in federal funding, which will be increasing the total outside source funding to 302,903,382. There were no additional adjustments to the amount of required county cash, which remains at 10,806,497. And again, the total federal programs spending is increased to 313,709. Sorry, 313,709,879 for the fiscal impact. The adoption of CR 15 should have a favorable fiscal impact as it reflects an increase in county grant funding and the Maryland Department of Health awarded 960,000 for the state Crisis system funding program project. The Maryland Department of Health awarded 1 million 501,518,763 for the General Mental General Fund Mental Health grant and for the adoption of CR 15 2024. It will provide county agencies with additional funds to improve their service delivery and focus on special populations and our tasks that require increased budget obligations. That is all. Thank you. Thank you. Miss Skinner, can you share some insight into the increase for me? Yes, madam chair. We are joined with Deanna Baker Mims and Tara Bynum from our wonderful agency of OMB. And Miss Bynum is going to graciously go over the draft two for us. Thank you, Miss Bynum. Good afternoon. Actually, I'm Deanna Baker Mims. This is Misses Bynum. But again, draft two recognizes an additional 3,000,400. $3296, primarily for the health department, to recognize additional funding for the general Fund mental health program in the amount of 2,267,700, an adjustment of $112,500 for the state opioid response grant, an additional million dollars for the General Fund Services grant, an additional $50,000 for the tobacco enforcement grant. A grant again bringing the revised total for the resolution to 16,721,000. Thank you. Are there any questions from our colleagues? No questions. Is there a motion has been moved and seconded to move. Favorable. Please call the roll. Madam Chair? I vote aye. Vice chair Harrison? I vote aye. Mister Durnoga, Miss Oriata, Mister Franklin? Aye. Vote carries. 50. All right. Thank you.

Sponsored by council members Ivy Watson, Olson, Harrison, Hawkins, Fisher and Durnoga. Would Mister Tutt could please give us an overview? Thank you. Madam Chair. Cr 21st, 2024. And we should be working from draft two a. This is a resolution concerning adjustments to approved position grades. The resolution amends the authorized staffing count and or grade classification of positions in the twelve agencies the chair just listed for us. Details about the proposed changes are listed in attachment a. And also, I understand there was an amendment that was received and the Department of Housing and Community Development is requesting to reallocate two positions. These positions support the housing authority, and they also note the overall authorized staffing count does not change. We received this legislation from OMB, and we have the director of OMB, and as well as the deputy director of OMB president for any questions you may have about the legislation. Thank you, Madam chair. Let's see, we. We have amendments. I like to hear from the office of the county executive. Good morning, chair Ivey and council members. We are looking for favorable consideration on CR 21, 2024. And we are joined, as Mister Tutt stated, by deputy Director Amber Hendricks and Director Stanley early. And theyll be more than happy to go over that amendment with the council. Okay, let's hear from you. We're ready. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair, the amendment is simply the change in for two positions in the Department of Housing and Community Development. It's a grade increase that changes an information tech manager, which is a grade 29, to an attorney 5g, which is a grade 33, and a grade increase for a community services manager from grade 31, replaced with a deputy director, which is a grade 35. These are both the operational needs as the housing authority makes adjustments. And more broadly, all of the items that you see before you are a series of changes that have operationally, that operational requirements have made over the course of the year throughout the dozen agencies that we're talking about. And as you will recall, that if we have a grade increase on any position, we have to bring that back to council. Thank you so much. Are there any questions from the committee?

The purpose is approving certain multi year contracts in accordance with the Prince George's county charter and subtitle ten of the Prince George's county code. This resolution will approve the contracts requiring action by council. Action if you are in agreement. Specifically, multi year contracts exceeding an aggregate of $500,000 for goods and services, as well as multi year personal service contracts exceeding an aggregate of $100,000 must be presented for public review, comment and approval action by the county council. The policy note that you would have recently received this morning from Mister Moses just before this meeting began. Notes that the estimated fiscal impact is 60.4 million. And of course, again, we have OMB director early and deputy director Hendricks here if you have additional questions about this letter legislation. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you. Are there any questions from the committee? I was curious about the amount and what is included exactly. And the contracts for the refuse collection. Good morning again, madam chair. And I just want to apologize, Mister Tutt. I failed to include you on the email that has the more in depth details regarding these contracts. But I did just forward it to you. Miss Pamela Dickerson is here before the council to answer any specific 819 questions regarding the contracts. And we also have other representatives present who can also answer questions. I'll go to turn it over to Miss Pamela Dickerson, if she can address chair Ivey's question. Thank you. Good afternoon. Could you repeat the question please, so I can be sure to respond properly? Well, I guess I should be just clear about my concerns. I get a lot of complaints from people who feel that they haven't been properly served by whoever, whatever company is collecting their trash. I'm sure most of the time things are done very well. But occasionally I hear from people whose trash either wasn't picked up or there was a sea of trash left behind them on the ground. Litter. And it's a big concern for people. So I wanted to know what is in these contracts that covers these. These issues. To make sure that there is some consequence for not giving great service to our residents. Well, I can say, and the director for Doe is here. She is very intimate with this contract. It was actually the first opportunity that I had to meet the county to help assist with negotiations with these contracts. And I can say that you can come up to the front that we actually have an awesome team working with the director on these contracts, with her deputy director. They actually have a project manager who is intimate and out in the field daily. I can actually say daily is one of the few contracts that I have spoken to the most vendors with as it relates to the SLA's. Because we do know that trash collection along with snow removal is two big things that we really care about. But I will allow the director to speak to the different things that she and her team has put into place. But I can assure you those SLA's are in that contract this year. Thank you, director Crooms. Sure. Andre Crooms, director of department of environment a lot of the things that in this contract actually came from our conversation that we had here last year when we were talking about the budget and we were talking about the challenges around waste. So this contract really represents us doing a lot more for not a lot more cost, and that is pretty impressive. So we were able to one define the areas differently. So we're able to identify the service areas to make them more efficient for the folks who are out in the field picking up the trash or our trash haulers. We were able to go back to a place where we were following both the required, the required maximums that contractors should have. So there aren't contractors who are overburdened, who don't have the resources to efficiently pick up the trash. No one under this contract has more than what they can handle kind of over time. The last contract had seen growth where folks were having a larger percentage than they should have had. We were able to identify differently how we look at mistress, how we look at problems and increase fines appropriately where they needed to be increased for the places that we think to basically deal with violations, to prevent violations, by making the fines more appropriate. And we were overall able to still maintain having all county based contractors and having a broader diversity of county based contractors. Folks are closer to the areas where their trucks are housed. They're closer to where their businesses are. Contractors were able to come in and negotiate for the places and bid on the places that they really wanted.

No one under this contract has more than what they can handle kind of over time. The last contract had seen growth where folks were having a larger percentage than they should have had. We were able to identify differently how we look at mistress, how we look at problems and increase fines appropriately where they needed to be increased for the places that we think to basically deal with violations, to prevent violations, by making the fines more appropriate. And we were overall able to still maintain having all county based contractors and having a broader diversity of county based contractors. Folks are closer to the areas where their trucks are housed. They're closer to where their businesses are. Contractors were able to come in and negotiate for the places and bid on the places that they really wanted. So we think overall that we're already seeing, seeing some efficiencies in the time that we've, even with the contract not being in effect, just because of the conversations we had through that process. But we think that this will be a better contract. We think that the residents will be better served. We, of course, have 311 to deal with that. We have better ways of collecting data to do that. And we have more services that are under this contract, and they're done in a way where the resources are spread out from the contractors more evenly also. So we don't have contractors that have no work on Tuesday and all the work on Thursday. So they're rushing through to do that kind of work. So we're able to really use this to solve a lot of those issues, and we're also able to put it into one contract that is all about the cost, rather than having the revenues and the cost be separate, so that we're able to monitor overall the performance of the contractors and the actions that are happening more effectively. Well, that sounds encouraging. I'm glad to hear that all of the contractors are from Prince George's county or based here are their workers also primarily Prince Georgians, I believe. So there's. Are there requirements in the contract around workers? No. This one is under the first source agreement. So they should comply with 51% being from the county? Yes. And if you find out they're not, then what happens? Then we will work with employee Prince George's to ensure that they become compliant. Okay. I can have a conversation with you when this ends today. Thank you, Mister Dunoga. I guess my question is along the same lines. Do you have, I'm not sure what to call it, a scorecard, because I'm sure. Well, the haulers that do my district cover my district. I know I get a lot of complaints. So do you keep some kind of score and grade them? And can we have access to whatever the grading system is for these haulers? There wasn't a grading system, per se. However, past performance was taken into account in that we. So every time a resident calls us and tells us that there is a miss or there's trash juice, which is a phrase I never thought I would know, or, you know, refuse left behind, we validate that first. So we send out one of our investigators to follow up, find out if that is a, you know, if the resident is accurate in what happened, because sometimes misses Arwa folks didn't put out the trash soon enough. Figure out what's going on. We meet directly with the contractor, tell them about the problem, tell them to remedy the problem. And we issue fines where fines are appropriate. So we have the data on what fines were issued, and so that performance went into our evaluations and negotiations of what contractors got, what territories, and how much of the county contractors got. We think that one of the reasons that we weren't having good performance with some of the contractors is that they had expanded beyond their capacity to serve the residents effectively. And so the contractors that had the highest rates of fines do have significantly less territory than they had before. And so we think that they are now able to perform at a more effective level and meet the expectations of the residents. But we can certainly share, and I believe we do, in the budget process every year, where the fines came in, what the misses are, but we can make sure that we share that. Again, that'd be helpful. I haven't seen that before, so maybe I just haven't looked in the right place. I'll be sure to look. Out of curiosity, I would assume that there's requirements that they keep their vehicles up in terms of maintenance or the age of the vehicles. How does that work? So the health department and the Department of Environment, inspect the vehicles to ensure that they're not leaking, that they meet general standards. And then we also put the date of manufacturing of the vehicles. So we are having our haulers phase in new vehicles over the course of this contract. So they are not allowed to have vehicles older than a certain age, even if those vehicles meet the health and safety standards of inspection. We know that having a newer vehicle means fewer emissions, means less likelihood of breakdown, means less likelihood of problems. So we, in addition to licensing, licensing each vehicle, inspecting each vehicle annually, giving them, you know, a, you know, a little tag that says that they're licensed, we also are phasing in newer vehicles under this contract. Thank you, Miss Crooms. Councilmember Oriata. I just had a quick question, because you did talk about ones that have, like, higher fines or amounts of fines gets, let's take territory. I'm just curious, like, so where do you decide that those vendors are going to go and who they're going to service? Because I just want to make sure that we don't see a concentration of people that have the highest fines serving certain parts of the community where the ones with no complaints are serving a different part of the community.

Thank you, Miss Crooms. Councilmember Oriata. I just had a quick question, because you did talk about ones that have, like, higher fines or amounts of fines gets, let's take territory. I'm just curious, like, so where do you decide that those vendors are going to go and who they're going to service? Because I just want to make sure that we don't see a concentration of people that have the highest fines serving certain parts of the community where the ones with no complaints are serving a different part of the community. So just curious about that. And then I know you talked about that when there's a complaint, someone investigates it. And then the escalation to, if there's going to be a fine, can we see the data between how many fines, I mean, excuse me, how many complaints are filed versus how many actually result into fines? Because I'd be interested to see that, because I get that we're investigating. But if we have, for example, 60% more complaints than actual fines, I feel like that would be problem when it comes to, like, keeping these businesses accountable to the quality of service that they get. Because I get that we're investigating, but if you come out after the trash is already, the trash man's gone, it's just one person's word over the other. If they say they got it out in time and they're saying they didn't, there's a question of like, well, who are you going to believe, right? And then there's idea of, I just want to make sure we have a level of customer service because it can't be a huge amount of complaints. And then it's all, you know, crying wolf of the community. I think there has to be some fire there. So every validated complaint results in a fine. So if we can validate a complaint, it results in a fine. One of the things we added on this contract is that if a, if, when the hauler is out in the community, if a trash can is not out, they are to take a photograph. Therefore they have proof that there was not a trash can there out at the time that they picked up the trash. So then if a resident calls and says, well, they missed my trash, and we see a photograph of the entire front yard of the house, then we know that that's not true. Right. If they don't have that, then we're looking at the resident, as you know, they put out the trash because these folks didn't verify that that trash wasn't there. It makes us have less investigations to do do, and it also holds the trash haulers accountable. The trash, I'm sorry, that is in the new contract that starts in July. Correct. And then in addition. So you were talking about where people wound up. So where people wound up was where they bid. So in most cases, the haulers bid in places that are the closest to their facilities. So by and large, you know, that's how we selected folks. We certainly did not decide that one community got a worse vendor over another. We did it based upon a cost based system in combination with appropriate metrics for performance. So we are able to rank those things. But by and large, we saw that folks bid on the areas that they believed that they could do effectively. So I'm hopeful again that we've done it in a way that we will see better performance across the board. But no, decisions are not made that we're going to. We didn't decide to switch folks around because this community has always had the bad hauler and now they're going to be over here. No, we looked across it and folks bid. We looked for what was the most cost effective way to handle it for the county while ensuring that we were getting proper performance and putting these extra measures in place to ensure we get proper performance. And last question, I guess because you're switching over to this new contract and you're putting these, I guess, safety measures, for lack of a better word, to get better service. Were there some haulers that did such a poor job, they're not on the list of contract? I'm just also trying to see do we have, like, consequences that are real and tangible that are happening? Because to chair Ivey's point, this is probably the thing we hear a lot of complaints about in our community. Yeah. I mean, there have been contractors that have been removed from the contract. We have had escalations with contractors in terms of the procurement process to hold them accountable. To have them have, you know, basically performance plans to come back into compliance. And yes, there are a few that have particularly bad performance that have been removed or in some cases chose not to bid again because they know that they weren't going to get there. And we also have had contractors in the past who have not paid their bills, and those ones are not also new, not part of this contract. May I add, starting July 1, we will have performance evaluations that should be conducted by everyone that manages a contract. So quarterly, there will be performance evaluations of those vendors, and we will collect that information, that data to look at service levels as well as new performance. So if you're not performing contractually, we will be able to help and be able to look at the vendors, and that will go against their performance whenever they are applying for other solicitations in the county. I know that we all have a few more questions, and we don't want to hold this up because I believe there's a deadline looming as far as when this must be approved, assuming it will be approved. And so I'd like to make a motion that we move this, but without a recommendation to essentially buy us a little more time. Is there a second? Second. Mister clerk, please call the roll.

As Miriam mentioned, I'm a graduate of Spelman College. I'm a native of Columbus, Ohio, but I consider Prince George's county my home. I'm currently working as an office managing partner in the Washington DC office for my law firm, where I've served for 18 years as a lawyer. And my practice is really focusing on providing strategic advice to clients and really high exposure liability matters, which really has translated to my work with WSSC to really think through issues of import in our industry. I currently sit on several boards, and so I have the board experience and the governance experience to lead. But I also would continue to be. I would also be honored to continue my role as chair of the Legislative Committee for Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. It's really where a lot of the work is being done when you think about the issues that are affecting the residents in Prince George's county and how we can rectify those issues on a legislative level. So again, I live in Bowie, Maryland with my husband, who's an air force veteran. We have three very small children who enjoy the benefits all of Prince George's county daily, and I would be honored to continue to serve in this role, and I'll take any questions that you may have. Thank you very much. Let me turn to my colleagues and see if there are any questions. Mister Burroughs, I'd like to move favorable. Okay, there's a motion by. Mister Burroughs, a second by councilmember Fisher. Is there any discussion seeing none. Clerk, please call the roll chair. Olson. Aye. Vice chair Harrison. Vote aye. Council member Barrows, congratulations about. Aye. Thank you. Council member Danoga. Aye. And councilmember Fisher? I vote I passes 50. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Congratulations, and we'll see you again at the full council hearing. Yes, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for serving. All right, all right. Thank you. So next, Mister Battle, looks like we have a resolution concerning the 2018 water and sewer plan. Would you please orient us this? CR 23, also known as the December cycle of amendments to the 2018 Water and sewer Plan, consists of applications for category change, and there are a couple of waiver requests. Also, I want to mention that. And while the staff is transitioning, what we have is. The public hearing on CR 23 occurred on May 7. On the 14 applications listed here, I'm joined by various staffs who that represent the agencies that provide input on the applications and the requests. So while I'm doing this, mister chair, I want to put their name plates out. And so as I do it, I'll introduce them. Miss Shirley Anthony Branch from C five, which is the lead agency in processing these applications. Miss Evelyn Hovind is from the health department and we have misses bottom ready here from Miss Parker Clare. Now I want to also give Miss Branch an opportunity to introduce her colleague here, who is new to the process and so new that we don't have a name place. I apologize for that. Good morning. I'd like to introduce Asha Royal. Asha is shadowing me as the water and sewer plant coordinator because we have not had someone to shadow me in quite some time. So she has been working with me now for about two months and will continue to work so that she can learn my process and everything that I do. Welcome. So, mister chair, for our process we're going to bring up the applications from the staff report. So I'll ask the IT staff to please put our staff report up on the screen and thank you very much. And what we'll do is I'll give a brief overview of each application, mister chair, and unless there's a desire by the committee to separate one of these applications, we can just do one motion on all the applications at the end. If you want to pull something out, we can do that and have a separate vote if that works for you. Well, let's have the presentation. Okay. All right, so as I said, let's see if this works. There it is. So there are 14 applications. We have one in district two, in district one, we have one in district four, two in district eight and nine applications in district nine. So we'll go to the first application, which is there it is in the blue planes, Seward Basin, we have 6401 Bandus and road. And the request is to go from category five to four. And the development proposal is for 101 single family dwellings, each with 2000 living space and minimum sales price of $400,000. And again, the request is to go from category five to category four, which would allow them to start the process by filing a preliminary plan of subdivision. The next application, you got a question, has a question. I'll start by saying I support the category change. Having said that, this is a question I've had over the years. Miss parents probably remember that's a really large area that's probably going to get rezoned to something other than residential. It's probably not 101 single family houses. So what happens when they come in with an application for something different? Because this, we see this a lot. We're approving 101 single family detached homes, but that, unless I'm mistaken, that area is long been slated for something different. Okay. So are we talking a zoning issue or potential zoning? Zoning, I think potential change in zoning expected. It's in an industrial area. There's a lot of industrial around it. It's off the county connector. I think when you go back to the older master plans for that area, it's been kind of a whole RR has been a holding zone for it. So maybe there's 101, but if you look at the. Go to the next slide. Oh, can't see it up there, but I put my, put my report back up. It disappeared. I know we want to see misses Dunoga, but. No, we do. And I love seeing myself as well, but there we are. Okay, so where's the map? Oh, I think that was first. Right. That's a lot of acres, and that's long been talked about for more, more intense use than RR residentials. I'm just curious, what happens when we approve this to move the category four, but then it gets, if it gets zone, then they come in with something completely different. How does that get handled? Okay, so, and let me see if I'm understanding your question. You're saying if we move this to category four and right now the zone rr, and if they wanted to come in and I guess get a rezoning. Okay, then they would have to go before the planning board to get it rezoned, because right now we're reviewing it for what it's currently zoned, as our rezoning would come to us ultimately. But I'm saying what happens with the water and sewer category and when you're approving it, for one thing, I've raised this question for 20 years because we've seen this. You know, like I said, I support this. I think looking with the long term plans a", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Prince George's County", "insights": [{"observation": "The 2018 Water and Sewer Plan consists of applications for category change, and there are a couple of waiver requests.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The request is to go from category five to four, which would allow them to start the process by filing a preliminary plan of subdivision.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The development proposal is for 101 single family dwellings, each with 2000 living space and minimum sales price of $400,000.

But nonetheless, when the application says 101, single family detached. Okay. Well, you do have an opportunity to review it again when it goes to four and it goes through preliminary plan review. And then if at some point in time they request a rezoning, they cannot move forward to another category until the rezoning gets approved, what have you. But then you, as the council member will get another chance to review it because it goes from four to three. Four to three. So at that point, you would have an opportunity to review it again. Okay, very good. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay, please proceed. So, the next application. Sorry. Next application is 23 BpO three Merkirk. And this application is for two warehouses with a total of 269,000. Request is to go from sewer category five to sewer category four. And the next application is 23 Wo two. This is in the western branch basin and the application is entitled assembly for worship. And this. The development proposal is for 2100 square foot church. And the request initially was to go from category five to three. And the county exec is recommended going to category four, which will allow the applicant to file a preliminary plan of subdivision. And the planning board has also concurred with that recommendation. The next application is 23 wo three, mountain of fire and miracles ministries. This application is for a two level, 43,815 square foot church. And this. The request here is to go to category four so it can go from category five to four and again, would allow the applicants to file a preliminary plan. Subdivision. The next application is 23 w zero four is 6505 Johantsu Drive. And this application is for a retirement community of 176 townhomes, three of each 3000 sqft with a minimum sales price of 400,000. Again, the request is to go from category five to four, the next. And the county exec is recommending approval of the request. The next application is 23 p zero one. And this is in the Piscataway basin. And this application is entitled Moore's Road subdivision. And this case, the development proposal is for two single family dwellings, each with 4108. Request is to go from category five to four. Yes. Yes, I'm sorry, the county executive recommendation approval of that request. Category four. Sure. Which one? Mountain. The county execs recommendation for Mountain of fire and miracles is to advance the category four. Yes. And in some of the cases, and just for the record, there were some applicants who were actually requesting waivers from the requirement to connect to the public system. And after some discussions, it was determined that it would be more appropriate for those applicants to ask for a request to go to category four and then allow them to start the planning processes. And that if in fact a waiver was appropriate for an interim system until they could connect to the public system, then that request could be granted by DPI. That's correct. So in this case, the council is sort of getting moving away from the practice of granting waivers and more so allowing applicants who want to move forward with development to go to category four and then to go to the appropriate officials to get the appropriate agencies rather to get their necessary program. All right. Okay. So we were at Moore's Road and we indicated that their request for category four and the county executives is requesting approval for that category change for the two single family dwellings. The next application is refuge Temple worship center. And this application is for a 7600 square foot church. And the request here is for a waiver to. A waiver to use an interim septic system. And this is an example where we're talking about councilmember Harrison. And here the county exec's recommendation is to deny the waiver request, but to approve advancement to category four to, again allow them to begin the development process and determine, you know, what's the best route for them to take. So. And the planning board has also joined in, in approving that request for advancement, category four. Now, usually the planning board does not get involved in making recommendations on waiver requests, so, but in this case, they're agreeing with the recommendation to move to category four. The next application is 23 p zero. 416 108 Cedar Lawn Drive. And in this case, the development proposal is for one single family dwelling, 3600 applicant. The request again is for a waiver to use the interim septic system. The county's act's recommendation is to deny the waiver request. And in this case, there is no consideration of moving to category four simply because the. The property, there's no public water and sewer available in that area and the property does not perked and it would not work to approve an interim septic system. So. Cedar lawn drive. Yes. Next application is 23 po five, 9204 Old Palmer Road. And in this case", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Merkirk", "insights": [{"observation": "Application is for two warehouses with a total of 269,000.

Request is to go from category five to category four. County exec is recommending approval and apply. Planning board did so as well. We have the next application. 23 po six, Moses Whitehurst residence. And in this case, the application, the request is for one single family dwelling, 3500 request is to go from category five to category four. And both the county exec and planning board recommend approval of that request. We have the next application is 23 p zero seven. And this is 7707K road. And for K Dot Road, this is for a healthcare facility which is 454,000. This is, the request is to go from category five to category four. And in this case, the issue there is, there was a piece of the property that was, that needs to be, the category needs to be changed for a very small piece so that the entire property can go through the development process together and see here next. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You want to go back to that one? Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. Let's go. Mister chair for the KDOT property, the changes solely for the medical facility. That's correct. That's the development proposal? Yes, that's all it is. Now, there was a piece of the property that was at some point it was drawn out of the sewer island of. And so basically, a very small piece of this property needs to be categorized with the rest of the property. But yes, the development process is just for the health care. Thank you. Mm hmm. And let's see here at the next application is 23 mo 1113, three one one old indian head road. And for this one development proposal is for one single family dwelling consisting of 4000 livable space. And the request is to go from category five to four. And that recommendation? That request is the recommendations for approval by the county deck and the planning board. All right. Next one is 23 m zero three Morton farm. And Morton Farm, the development proposals for two single family detached dwellings, each consisting of 2200. Let's see. The request is to move from category five to four and both county executive planning will recommend approval of category four. Let's see then. We have 23 m zero 413, three one one old indian head road. This one is one single family dwelling with 4000 be occupied by the current owners. And the request is to advance from water to category three, and this one from category five to category for water. And if the address looks familiar, this is a situation where the property had to put in one request for their sewer and one request for their water. So water is there. They can have category three for the sewer. They're going through category four. And the rest of the development process, let's see. Cycle also includes some redesignations. And if you recall, there are from time to time, there's a need to update sewer maps to reflect current properties which already exist and already are connected to the public system. But, you know, at some point, the maps did not recognize those properties. So we're basically, these are map corrections. So, mister chair, that concludes my report and my summary. And if there are any questions, we can take those right now from the committee. Okay, thank you very much. Let me turn to my colleagues. Welcome, chair Ivey. Any questions of staff? Yes, Mister Vice chair. Thank you. Mister chair, I have a correction. How would you like to handle this? As you know, I just discussed with you about one particular property that's already recommended as a denial. As a denial. So that's within them. That would be within the overall. So if you took one motion to approve the county executive recommendations. It would include a denial of that. Mister Dernoga? I make a motion for favorable recommendation. That is a motion. And a second for favorable. That was Mister Vernoga and Miss Fisher. Any discussion? Seeing none, madam. Clerk, please call the roll chair. Osa. Aye. Vice chair Harrison. Aye. Vote aye.

We urge you to fully fund the important work of Maryland National Capital park and Planning Commission. People need parks more than ever to connect with nature and each other, and the commission's planning function takes on more importance as we face a future with a changed climate. Yesterday, I took my granddaughter to Watkins park. Much of the playground equipment was too hot to touch in April, but in the shady woods, the natural surfaces were cool and comfortable. Children need to play outside, and they need natural surface play areas in shady places. Ensuring that there are functional water fountains near playing fields and stations for refilling reusable bottles is important not only to decrease litter and plastic waste, but also to prevent heat related illness among those who work and play outdoors. Please don't spend any more tax player money on new artificial turf. Invest instead in grass playing fields that sequester carbon through photosynthesis and cool through evapotranspiration rather than creating more mounds of toxic plastic waste. Also include funding for needed all the funding that is needed to implement the new tree conservation regulations. In many of our parks, invasive vines threaten a tree canopy.

Regarding planning, please continue investing in the integration of climate resilience goals into all long range county plans, policies, and CIP programs. This requires dedicated staff time and dedicated staff and dedicated funding for consultant support. Please fund the development of new processes that include climate criteria so that progress toward climate goals can be tracked and projects that decrease greenhouse gas emissions and improve climate resilience get prioritized. Please fund the development of a plan for a network of resilience hubs so that every neighborhood has a place to go when the power goes out. Funding should be allocated to identify potential locations for such hubs. Some existing Maryland national capital parks and planning community centers should be among the locations identified. Long reach planning should include development and maintenance of resilience hubs for all communities. New community centers should be climate ready powered with resilient clean energy systems. New residential developments should include resilient energy systems and access to a resilience hub. Even during this time of budget constraints, caring for our natural places and providing spaces for people to play and get together outdoors and climate conscious land use planning are not optional. Please do all you can to make sure Maryland national capital parks and planning has the resources it needs to continue its work in the entrance of the health and well being of the people of Prince George's county. Thank you. Thank you very much. Alex Hurdle good evening chair Ivey and members of the council. My name is Alex Hurdle. I live in Riverdale park. Tonight I will be speaking as a citizen. First, I would like to applaud the parks and recreation for their efforts in making wonderful places to recreate in our county. My eleven year old daughter enjoys our parks in proximity to our house, the playgrounds, the dog park, the ball fields, and other amenities where we can recreate. However, there are a number of challenges in our park. I'll start off with specifically trees. Within the past year, we've seen a number of mature trees that have been cut within our parks. Oftentimes these trees are laying there before they're taken up by the tree companies. I wonder if some of these trees could have been cut a little bit later or we could have gotten a second opinion from a certified arborist. Oftentimes these trees seem to have maybe have had partial diseases, but have could have been up for a little bit longer. Trees are oftentimes planted also without the proper protection. Specifically in Riverdale Community Park, I find that trees are often planted without the fencing around them. Deer and other animals oftentimes destroy their bark and then their survivability is limited. The variety and diversity of trees seems to be limited. Also in our plantings I see many oaks and maples planted. However, limited numbers of gingoes, walnuts or other mulberry trees. Sometimes these trees can be messy, but we all know what monoculture of trees takes place. For example, the ash and elm tree pests and diseases have gotten to them and we find oftentimes large areas just taken. The trees are taken out because of the pests or disease. In addressing the few wooded plots that we have within the beltway, I would ask that the park and rec department take more maintenance in invasive species. The few woods that we have left oftentimes have invasive species that compromise the trees and other flora within those wooded plots. I'm looking forward to the department's full complement of the environmental stewardship division this year and all it can do to plant, protect and preserve the trees in our parks and our counties. Thank you. Thank you very much. Next we have ruby stemling. Good evening chair ivey and members of the county Council of Prince US county.

Past fundings by the county council has allowed ecolatinos to expand our capacity to grow and be able to reach more county residents. For fiscal year 25 24 25, Ecolatino seeks continued funding for our environmental education program for latino youth. We are also developing a spanish language green infrastructure and maintenance training specifically designed for current and prospective latino landscape professionals. These culturally appropriate programs, designed for underrepresented and under resourced communities, will translate into more sustainable communities and a healthier Chesapeake Bay watershed. With the county's support to Ecolatinos, we will continue to do our part to change the narrative that environmental actions in our communities are underfunded. Collatinos requires sustainable revenue streams to continue to build our capacity and allow for the continued expansion of our unique and innovative approach. Diversity is the county's greatest strength. Your support to colatinos will not only contribute to the creation of green jobs, but also engage our youth in the career paths of the future. Together we can work towards more inclusive, cleaner parks, greener spaces and ultimately a healthier and more sustainable future for all. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you very much.

Miss Orietha? Miss Watson. Present. Eleven members. President, roll call. Next we will have our invocation. Reverend Doctor Anita Knaves, pastor, global faith ministries and founder of combat boots for black justice. Good morning. Thanks for joining us. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Good graduates. Morning. And before we continue, I did want to check with my colleagues to see if they had any special intentions. Yes, ma'am. Okay, we have. Councilmember Fisher. Good morning. And I do have two things. One, I wanted to. We're closing out Asian Pacific Islander month and our county is a very inclusive place. And so I want to pray for our asian american brothers and sisters that live in our county and for all of their contributions to our fabric. And the second thing I would like for us to pray for is tomorrow is my best friend's birthday, Janelle K. Wilkins, the chair of the Black Hawk for the entire state of Maryland, and she's just the best. So that's it. All righty. Any other colleagues have any special intentions? Councilmember Orietta. Thank you. I'd like for all of our thoughts and prayers to be with a young man named John. His family, he was murdered and I know that his family's hurting right now and so just elevating them in our thoughts and prayers. Yes, ma'am. Is that the car accident situation? Okay. Yes, ma'am. All right. Any other council members? I would like us to remember that yesterday was Memorial day and we want to keep in our hearts and prayers everyone who's been affected by having lost a family member who has served in the line of duty. Amen. Thank you. May I begin? All right. Well, again, good morning. It's good to see new faces and old faces and familiar faces. My man crush, right there. Edward Burrs. How are you? Listen, I'm going to be real quick with the Lord put on my heart this morning. I think we all can benefit from this. Just thought of encouragement, word of encouragement. And I'm going to be very brief, but I know you all are smart people and you all would get it. So I was meditating on the scripture today, coming from the Book of Romans, chapter twelve, verses one and two. However, I would suggest to you that if you want to read the whole thing, read it. Because it's really good. But I was reflecting on the power of leadership. That's what the Lord put on my heart this morning. Leadership is so very important. And all of us have been in charge to make something. We all need something. And therefore leadership is important. And therefore we all are important because we all have been given a science to lead, to lead, whether you think so or not. And so as I was focusing on this scripture, it says, be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds that we may present that which is good, the perfect and the acceptable will of God. And as I focus on that, you know, there is a way to lead. God is expecting us to lead in a righteous way. Now, for pastors, we get it really hard. But also the same leadership principle goes to everyone. We are to lead from a heart, a Gopi perspective, love and respect, responsibility and accountability. We're not supposed to lead with a grudging heart. We're not supposed to lead for personal gain. We're not supposed to lead out of favoritism. We're supposed to lead in a righteous way and giving thought to all people, not people who support us, not people who are rich, but all people. And I just want to leave that thought with all of us. Whatever you are in charge of, God is in the county. He's assigning you to lead from a righteous perspective. And that's what it means to have that good, acceptable and perfect will of God in your heart, and also accountability and responsibility. Amen. Amen. So I just want to pray for everyone, Lord God, just thank you for another beautiful day, another beautiful moment, oh Lord God, that you have given all of us. Father Lord, we thank you for the power of leadership and that you trust each and every one, oh God. To lead in a righteous manner, Father Lord God, that we may present that which is good, perfect and acceptable will, and that which is pleasing unto you. Because at the end of the day, that is what matters. Lord God, we pray for all of those who will listen here, the asian and pacific islanders. Islanders. Thank you so much.

Thank you again for this opportunity to once again present and bring the commission with individuals with disabilities before they counsel. We appreciate this opportunity and we look forward to continuing this relationship. I'd like to first start off by saying that just giving you a brief summary of our listening sessions. We held three listening sessions across the county towards the end of last year. Very successful. We came away with a lot of lessons learned in reference to education, housing, transportation, employment, emergency preparedness, all of that. I will let my commissioner, Joy Bannister, address some of the details in that report as well as some other things that came out of that. And Commissioner Marjorie Lindsey Reid will be here to support that. I want to start off by, first off, just encouraging. We would like to know from you all how we could work better with the council and the commission to get or both of our agendas or information out about the commission. Because one thing we do know, that no matter whether it's a rule or regulation, if it's an amendment, if it's a bill, the disability community should be at the table. We are part of all of it if we're part of the fabric, and we should always be at the table and not an afterthought. And the second thing was, again, how we can support not just working with you, but educating the public in reference to persons with disabilities, both seen or unseen. And I will disclose here I have a hearing impairment. You wouldn't know that until I share that. Or you may think I was being rude by not answering you, but I can't hear without 810ft without my hearing devices. So some of these things people are open to sharing, some aren't. I don't have an issue with it because it helps to educate and teach us how to self advocate for ourselves. So that's one of our things. So I'm going to move on to one of the lessons. I had the opportunity to work the early polls this year. It was a great opportunity. I've been on the ballot. I've been outside passing flyers and everything for other candidates, but to work on the inside, looking out, it was a great experience. One of the things that came out of this year's general assembly was a bill that was put forth in reference to voter fraud. But what again, I'm going to reiterate the importance of having persons with a disability or considering persons with disabilities at the table. The purpose of this bill was to prevent voter fraud. At no time was there any consideration of the effect that it would have on persons with disabilities. It would have disenfranchised the disabilities community, as well as some of the seniors, from preventing them to vote. So that's one of the things that commission, we keep an eye out on everything that goes on in our communities, whether it's at council level, whether it's in Indianapolis, the general assembly, we keep an eye on that, and we encourage everyone to make sure that we are included in that process. And I'm gonna go there. One last thing. We are, and I'm gonna close out here and let my colleague here speak on some things in reference that I mentioned earlier, that we are holding a public hearing in June 5 at the University of Maryland, and we're encouraging everyone to come out to that event. We will be sending out flyers. It's all posted on nextdoor and all of that. Whether you are a caregiver, whether you have a person with a disabilities, or you have a family member, we encourage you to come out so we can hear your voices, so we can make sure that we can take this information back to everyone that can help us solve those problems. Oftentimes we tell our neighbor whether it's a crime committed, we tell our neighbor, we tell different people, but we don't go to the, we don't go to the sources place that they can actually help us increase awareness and resolve some of our issues. So at this time, I'm going to turn this over to Commissioner Bannister. Thank you, madam chair. Good morning, council. And madam chair, the city council. As commissioner Devela said, we did speak with several of our constituents through several learning listening sessions. And some of the main themes that we were hearing fell under four different categories. They were housing and development, transportation, the universal design working group, and deaf and hard of hearing access and access to information. And I'll quickly touch on each one of those. When it came to housing and development, one of the biggest concerns was the blue line corridor development. And one of the suggestions was making sure that our deaf and our deaf hard of hearing and disabled community can be a part of the input as we continue to develop that. The question was asked was, how will the council do that, and how can we, as the commissioner support that action?

Thank you, madam chair. Good morning, council. And madam chair, the city council. As commissioner Devela said, we did speak with several of our constituents through several learning listening sessions. And some of the main themes that we were hearing fell under four different categories. They were housing and development, transportation, the universal design working group, and deaf and hard of hearing access and access to information. And I'll quickly touch on each one of those. When it came to housing and development, one of the biggest concerns was the blue line corridor development. And one of the suggestions was making sure that our deaf and our deaf hard of hearing and disabled community can be a part of the input as we continue to develop that. The question was asked was, how will the council do that, and how can we, as the commissioner support that action? The next category was transportation, especially when it comes to east to west transportation issues, especially also in the southern part of the county where there's no metro accessible areas. This is going to require a conversation with innovation, research and we as a commission, we want to make sure that there is somehow a committee that can be focused to this for our disabled constituents. And that is something we can again work with the council to set up in regards to access to information. One of the things is with our flyers and information that goes out on our websites, making sure that accessibility is at the forefront before that information is already sent out, including even captioning example for this council meeting, maybe having a captioner here because as with the microphones have not been working. We have a population that may be able to use captioning as well, placement of interpreters during some of the press conferences. And really just by Prince George's county, with us being close to Gallaudet University and being close to Washington DC, we really have an opportunity to be a model county. And finally, universal design working group. This is a working group that is being set up by legislation that all homes need to be built under universal design by 2026. And so how can the commission serve as an additional resource to provide that perspective from those with disabilities? And that concludes my comments. Good morning, Madam chair and county council, and all in attendance. My name is Commissioner Marja Lindsey Reed. I'm a clinical social worker, by phrase, madam commissioner. Yeah, let's get you situated a little better. There you go. Okay. Do I need to start back at the beginning? You may as well. Okay. Madam chair and county council, and everyone in attendance. My name is Commissioner Marjorie Lindsey Reed. By trade, I am a clinical social worker, and I just would be remiss if I did not mention that may is mental health awareness month, but every month is mental health awareness month. That is a disability that is oftentimes not easily seen and it really affects our community. If anyone is not aware we have a crisis response in the county, we have changed recently, maybe a year or so ago, to a different agency, which is, in my personal and professional opinion, doing a much better job. So thank you for whoever helped to change that over. That's it. Thank you. I just want to go back to some of the questions, and I'm not sure if this is the right platform that we had asked in reference to. Could you just share how we could better work with you all as a commission and the council? Sure. I'll turn to my colleagues now for who would like to speak? Councilmember Fisher, it's so good to see you, madam Commissioner. I know I met with you personally in a couple of advocates on several pieces of legislation. I think it would be helpful if you all could maybe think about as our agendas and the bills come up for a review, if you think something specifically will impact the community, specifically in our disabled community. I think it would be helpful for some of the chairs and for the colleagues to sort of have awareness. And I know that we post all of the bills and the agendas online, and I think that would be sort of like a helpful way to do that as we communicate on legislation, on what you think the impact would be. I think that would be a great start. And of course, setting up your meetings with each of us individually as well, I think is always great. And I know we had a great conversation and are following up on doing a town hall with the council. Madam chair was busy with budget, so I didn't overwhelm her, but doing a specific town hall for our community that has disabilities, about what we do here on the council and to explain government in a better way. So I know we've talked about those things together, but I would say that would be my answer as I'm dealing with all our human service agencies. And I know that you're one of my priority focuses. So I think that would be a great way to go forward. Councilmember Burroughs, thank you so much. And thank you, madam chair, for your many years of service to the county. Thank you for being here today. One thing that would be helpful for me is that there, I'm not sure that there is one place where there are a list of services that we can direct people to. Sometimes on the county website there's a lot of information, and sometimes on that website there's outdated information. Some of those services no longer exist even though they're on the website. So if you have a list of actual services and programs that are helpful, that have been vetted, it would be helpful to get us that information so we can share it to our constituents.

A lot of us also want to focus on the type of initiatives and programs that we run and support in the county, and specifically through parking, planning and a better understanding if there's a gap there on the type of programming and the ability for our community to participate, and if we should think about things that need to be added to the program or even if we need specialized programs that hone into different communities that feel left out, I think that would be something we could work on as well. Councilmember Hawkins, thank you. Chair Ivey. One of the things I think you can share and commit yourselves to is advocating for more individuals with disabilities to have employment opportunities, not just throughout our government, throughout Prince George's county. And as you go around advocating and informing about roles and responsibilities that they could play in moving our government in our county publicly and privately forward. So consider that. Councilmember Olson, thank you, madam chair, commissioners, for being here and last year as well. I'm glad that we had an opportunity to sit down. I think. Yeah, just regular, regularly letting us know what kinds of barriers are out there that we can think the county can work with you on. I think those are things, just that kind of communication. There may be things that we don't know are barriers and letting us know and giving us, you know, feedback on a regular basis, that would be super. Thank you. Councilmember Watson. Thank you. And thank you for being here. Question also. Well, statement, if you could, you know, share your flyers or any of your programs that you have out in the community with us, that would be great. I would love to put that out to the district, four residents, as well as any district specific analysis that you may have so we can tailor programs or work with you to tailor some programs based on, you know, the people, what the people's needs are per district. That'd be great. Thank you. Thank you for that. And I just want to wrap up. I know, three minutes. I actually, I was about to call on myself. Okay. I try to let everybody else go first, but I, you know, you did mention the bill that's going to dramatically increase the amount of housing that's accessible, new housing as it's being built to be accessible. And we also would like to help people in their homes that are currently existing to be able to retrofit. And there are already some state, some state programs out there to help with that so you don't have to wait for us. But, and, you know, I do know that the AdA takes care of public buildings, or if you go to a restaurant, those are already supposed to be compliant so that you can go to those things. But we don't want people to feel that they're trapped in their home and unable to go to other people's homes. We want people to be able to visit and not think, oh, how many stairs can I make it? Am I going to, do they have a bathroom on the first floor. I can only stay for 2 hours because I know I'm going to have to use the bathroom. So things like that, we're trying to be thoughtful on, and we have had the disability community involved in the work group. We plan to have a report come out so that we have a full document, but before we submit it to the public, I'll make sure that you get a copy of it and you have the opportunity to weigh in. Also, these meetings are the second Wednesday of the month at. I can't remember, is it 09:00 or 10:00? I'll have to look real quick. No, it's 09:00, 09:00 a.m. so. And they're in person, although they are, they are also streamed for people who want to observe from home. So we're very happy to have you come to the meetings as well. So thank you so much for that. And you've had, madam chair, you had some other comments. Yes, I do. I'm going to try to just briefly go over because we're taking notes, but I do know, and thank you for inviting us to that meeting because we actually meet. We're still meeting virtually the third Wednesday of every month from four to 06:00 p.m. the link is on the website. I'm going to go back to council member Burroughs in reference to a place for resources, as you all know, that the whole county is, the county as a whole is revamping their, it, their websites and all of that. Part of that is we are actually, we've been asked to work with someone in the development in reference to making the sites accessible. So that's a great step in the right direction. As was mentioned earlier, the flyers and correspondents, and when we send the flyer, we will show you what the difference, plain text, what an accessible document is. This all goes back to training, I believe is training. And it hits on not just for anybody working with any public facing person in your office, whether it's your chief of staff, whether it's your, whoever you're a community engagement person is, should be trained in reference to communications with persons in the disability community. And I'm going to touch on the voting, the voting as well. We believe that instead of legislation, it should be training at the board of elections.

And I'm going to touch on the voting, the voting as well. We believe that instead of legislation, it should be training at the board of elections. More training needs to be done. And I will digress here a little bit. The purpose of that bill came about because two officials witnessed one person assisting 30, up to 30 people voting. And they said that, you know, they just felt it was something wrong the election judge said it was nothing they could do. Well, that's not true. They just were not trained. You cannot do that. You have to have someone. There has to be communication between the two people there. So we're working with the board of elections to work on that, too, so that it will be handled in the training side of it. Again, legislation needs to consider persons with disabilities as reference to employment. Some of the things in internship councilmember Hawkins mentioned he has hired a person with the disabilities just for the visibility. I'm not going to say just for the visibility, but it just demonstrates that we are capable. We are still productive in our lives. We may have a disaster, but this does not define us. We can still give back to our communities. So we would like to see some of that in reference to representations in your programs, whether it's your summer hires, whether it's your park and planning programs. We have programs that accommodate. But are there programs that actually geared towards persons with disabilities? Goes back to playgrounds, accessible playgrounds? We have a few. They've gotten better, but there's more to making a playground accessible. What happens once they access the playground? Can they actually get on the rides? Can they utilize that? So it's a full circle schools. Some of our schools have playgrounds as well. They are not accessible, so they rely on the community recreation centers to do that. But what does a child do in the school when their classmate or their sibling is playing and they're sitting out because they can't access the playgrounds. So these little intricacies about these things with reference to person with disabilities, again, it should not be an afterthought. We do things naturally, but we don't. We don't always include or consider persons that it is not natural to them anymore. They're learning new ways to communicate, new ways to live a full life. And so that's one of the things we want to drill home, especially here, that, you know, consider your residents, all, the entire community, when you're doing engaging with us. And again, thank you for this opportunity and look forward to working with you. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. And now we will turn back to public hearing CR 33, a resolution concerning fiscal year 2024 annual action plan for housing and community development for the purpose of amending the Prince George's county fiscal year 2024 Annual Action Plan for housing and community development by adding the Bowie Commons Project, an eligible activity not originally funded or described in the fiscal year 2024 Annual Action Plan, and the reprogramming and reallocation of $1 million in home investment partnerships program funds from the fiscal year 2021 annual Action Plan to support the Bowie Commons project.

We're asking that everyone, all of us in our community open our eyes and pay attention to issues that are harming us. We're not asking for anyone to be harmed financially, to be put in an uncomfortable place. We just would like for everyone to actually have the opportunity to address our issues in our community in a safe and respectful way. Putting literature in zones or places where people have access to firearms is not only a great strategy to actually save lives, it will actually protect so many of us in our community from future harm. Now, my family, we're here today because we had to bury a child. A child. Now we had our eyes wide open. Doctor Jeffrey Grant. I'm a CEO of a residential middle school that addresses children who are going through trauma. So every day I have families and children in front of me, I have my nephew in front of me. And unfortunately, I didn't see it soon enough. So if we had the literature in a place where he went by himself the day before he was returned to his fourth year of school, Maryland Eastern shore, at least something or someone could have stopped it. Or he could have thought about it before he went into a shooting range and accessed the firearm that ended his life. Because we did not have it in our homes for him to access, but he was able to get it in our community. So now, as the persons who make the decisions in our communities, let's do something so that we cannot lose another life that we can surely save. Thank you very much. Very, very sorry to hear of your loss. Suicide is a terrible, terrible thing. And we now have a presentation by committee staff. Madam chair, we would not have that on this particular item. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. We really, really appreciate you coming down to speak, and our hearts go out to you. Thank you all for your time. Have a great day. This hearing has been held, I think. Thank you very much. Next, we have a public hearing on CB 720 24, an act concerning the revised elderly property tax credit for the purpose of revising the current elderly tax credit. Property tax credit to take, I'm sorry. To make its applicability exclusive of and separate and distinct from the home homestead and Maryland homeowners property tax credit. The sponsors are council members Burrow, Ivy, Harrison, Dernova, Fisher, Olson, Watson, Bligue, Oreada, Franklin and Hawkins. Before we go to the speakers list, I wanted to note. Council member Hawkins, I believe you have to leave at noon. Okay. So I just wanted to make sure we set that so while people are speaking, because this could take a while. I want to make sure everyone understands why he leaves. He's not leaving because you're speaking okay. And I can give you three minutes, but I ask that if you feel that other speakers have already said what you're going to say, you can perhaps make your comments briefer, but you may take your entire three minutes. If you would like. We will start. I will read several names so that you can be kind of teed up to start coming forward. We'll start with Robert Samuels, and then Jeff Shomish, who's the mayor of Landover Hills, and Sheila Fagan from Livingston Heights association. And anyone who has signed up to speak, please be in this room. Don't be in one of the other rooms because. Because you won't be here to speak when your name is called. So is Robert Samuels not here? Well, please come up, sir, as your name is called, please approach the podium. And then the next two people will be Mayor Shomish and then Sheila Fagan. And if anyone here is to speak but you don't, you can't come up to the podium, please let us know and we'll bring you a mic. Mister Samuels, you have three minutes. Yes, ma'am. Good afternoon, fellow homeowners from Prince George's county and my special friends are sitting back at me. To Fagans. How are you doing back there? I'm Robert Samuels. I live over in district eight, over in the fort Washington area. And I came to the last meeting when the subcommittees voted to have us here today. The association of Retired Police Officers, which I am, they say over 1000 police officers a night in 2020 live within the state of Maryland. I have been in Prince George's counties since age 20, currently 73. Thank the Lord.

This is really needed for even people like myself, who has retired from Washington, DC Police Department, as well as the public schools history in Prince George's County. I need it for my medication. I've always paid my Maryland taxes and for the services that Prince George County, Maryland, provides to its citizens. It's definitely, definitely needed. I'm hoping that our entire council will vote in favor of this. I've lived in the same house over here in Fort Washington since 1981, when I first bought my first property, and I'm still in that same house. So, council members, please look at all these folks who come out in support of this. Please support this legislation. It's definitely, definitely needed. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mayor Shomish and Sheila Fagan. If you could also start moving towards the front. Good morning. I'm Jeff Shomish, the mayor of Landover Hills, a community of about 500 single family homes a number of which are owned by senior citizens who are a vital part of our community. They, the ones that are retired, volunteer for the town, for the churches in our area, for many community groups that we have. This bill, I think is needed, especially if we are committed to helping seniors who want to remain in their homes and age in place. So I would urge you to pass this legislation. Thank you. Thank you. Sheila Fagan and then Rose Hobson and Daisy Midgette. Good morning, council. And if you could bring your mic closer. There you go. A little better. Good morning, council and council chair. I'm Sheila Fagan, head of the Livingston Heights association at Oxen Hill, Maryland. My husband and I personally assisted many seniors in filling out the senior property tax credit form, only to receive letters in the mail that they did not qualify because they already had the homestead credit. We have paid our dues in county taxes. We have worked over 45 years. We are active voters and involve citizens. We are now on fixed incomes. The cost of everything has gone up tremendously, including food, medication, housing, and the basic things that we need to properly care for ourselves as we age. We are trying to stay afloat. We have earned the elderly property tax credit, which is a small amount compared to everything we have put into the county and compared to our neighboring states. We are praying that you all do the right thing and approve this amendment. Thank you. Please, please. You actually are not allowed to clap. Yeah, sorry. We have rules. We have rules. We have to follow them. Okay, next, Rose Hobson from the AARP. And then Daisy Midgette and Melita Yearwood. Good morning. Prince George's county council. County council and chair. Thank you for the opportunity to come before you and speak. If you could move the mic a bit or stand closer. My name is Rose Hobson. I'm state coordinator for driver safety for AARP, and I represent the fabulous, the fearless, 50 plus population. ARP is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization here in Prince George's county. We pay the highest taxes. We're not asking for a lot. We're asking for something. You asked us to vote for you. We did that. We asked you. I'm sorry. You also can't, like, speak out during someone's time. I know it's hard, but think about how we teach our children to behave in class and try to follow those rules. Thank you. Now, where was I? It's kind of hard to follow when you get interrupted. Go ahead. Okay. Each of you have family members, 60 plus, in your own family lineages. We, as seniors of the state of Maryland, Prince George's county. We implore you, beg you to support us, protect us and support the bill, CB Zero zero 720 24. We need you to support us and protect us and we're asking you to do so. Thank you so much. Thank you. Daisy Majette. Melita Yearwood. Then Margaret White. Madam chair and council members, for the record, my name is Daisy Cherry Majette. I'm here today to testify in favor of CB Zero zero 724 to revise the property tax credit for residents in their home, ensuring that seniors receive the full 20% tax credit regardless of other tax credits they may have. I'm speaking for the majority of the residents of the Wilburn community, as most of the residents are seniors. When I ask for your support of the CB Zero Zero 724, thank you in advance for your favorable support of CB Zero Zero 720 24. Thank you. Thank you. Melita Yearwood, Margaret White and then Katherine Williams. Good afternoon, council members. The removal of the limitation property tax credit to allow seniors to receive the full 20% tax credit is a great first step and ask you to support that totally. But we can go a little further with this. I'd like for you all to take into consideration that yes, we're seniors are on a fixed income. They're the current economic climate. Our property values have skyrocketed and therefore our property taxes are high. Senior communities that are being built are built at being built at the high 400,500 thousand above.

But we can go a little further with this. I'd like for you all to take into consideration that yes, we're seniors are on a fixed income. They're the current economic climate. Our property values have skyrocketed and therefore our property taxes are high. Senior communities that are being built are built at being built at the high 400,500 thousand above. We need to lighten the financial load balancing prescription drug costs and various other responsibilities that we have. There's also a thing about once a senior applies for the benefit, we have to reply up high again after five years. Why is that being done? What is it that it can't be done once and done? That's it. Another thing to consider is to reevaluate the cap on assessed property values at $500,000. That is too low considering the way the housing market has skyrocketed and even the benefit to increase that amount by 3% annually for inflation, it still is not helping us as seniors. I'd like to know what percentage of the seniors in the county are actually able to benefit from this legislation as a whole. Previously stated by Calvin Hawkins. It allows. This bill allows the seniors to benefit financially, puts extra money in our pockets and seniors residents are the pillar of our communities and you all need to continue to do what you can to provide support to all of us seniors, there's still a ways to go. We appreciate the efforts that are being made at this point, but the bottom line is that we seniors should be able to age in place in our longtime homes. Thank you. Thank you. I can't tell if it's Williams or William's son. Good morning. It's William sun. Okay, so Miss Margaret wasn't ahead of me, but I'll go ahead. Good morning. And thanks to the chair and the council members for again hearing this bill revised property tax bill that is truly, truly needed for our seniors. Again, I'm Kathryn Williamson. I'm currently president of the AARP 939 chapter, the only chapter here in Prince George's county and the largest chapter in the state of Maryland. As others have said, we pay high property taxes. We have worked all of our lives here to come, to retire and live prosperous. But because of inflation, economy, high costs to live, we need help. We need all the help we can get. This property tax will help pay a bill for a whole year. Think about that. I can use it. Many of us can use it up. I'm a tax preparer, volunteer tax preparer for Ir's and I see and I don't understand sometimes how we make it so. Living in this county, paying our taxes, doing what we supposed to do to live and age in place. This is small compared to what is really needed to help the live prosperous in the state of Maryland and in this gorgeous county of Prince George's. I encourage you as others, this is my second time here, my third time present for this bill. And I'm asking that you strongly, strongly support this bill and pass it. I don't want to come back. I just want to rejoice that it's passed. Thank you. Up. Don't forget. And I'm sorry, Margaret White, I skipped you, Miss White, and I really apologize. And I hear you just had a birthday. I did. Happy birthday. 95. Very oppressive. All right, you can clap for that. Yes, and I owe it all to the good lord. Walking and talking. Look, I'm Margaret White from Millwood, Waterford Citizens association, president of Millwood, Waterford Citizens Association. 485 residents and most of us, except the new residents coming in, are over 65. So I am just asking if you would revise the current elderly property tax credit bill, CB Zero zero 720 24, so that it is separate from the homestead property tax or any other taxes that is in effect or may be added in the future. Approximately 50% of middle income seniors are retired or may or may not have held executive positions such as doctors, lawyers, CEO's or other high paying position, or even held a college degree. Some retirees may not have had retirement plans or have had a saving account for old age. It may or may not have been available for people in certain positions. In the fifties, people who look like me did not have the advantage of high paying jobs or higher education or history. Our history will verify that I was a nurse at Howard University and went to work there for $8,000 a year, bought my house. So I can say that that was a position that is vital and essential to people. But $8,000 and I retired from Howard University less than $25,000. So surveys and studies will show that over half of seniors 75 years old or older are now living alone, their widows or widows, and also have incomes under $50,000 a year. It was also stated in a survey that 90% of seniors prefer to live at home. And it has been shown that the cost is more effective to the government if we live at home. I don't believe this should be considered a hangout, but consider it an earned credit income that was held back from us when we were doing these jobs and didn't have the retirement plan. We didn't have the insurance, and we didn't have all the perks that they have now. We didn't have the advantage of going to college like the kids had now. So please consider us. And Lord Willard, I hope I don't have to come back when I get 96. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming out. We really appreciate you. Kay Miller and then Patricia Monroe and Sharon Lawrence.

Am I good? I can hear you, but it might help to bring it down a bit. Some of the things I want to say is the same as they had, but I wanted to add a couple more things. I, too, object to the $500,000 cap, and I object to the five years. You know, I think it should be life time. And years ago, when I heard about this discount, I heard rumors like you had to live in your house 30 years. So I was going 27, 28, 2030. I thought, oh, I'm here now. But then all of a sudden, you put all those extra rules on. Also, I think Howard county has something 70, 30, 30 years in your house, 70 years of age. So I think you could raise the age up not so low. Also, my daughter lives in Michigan. I don't think the house taxes change until you move. They stay the same. And I have a friend in Florida. She, too, pays the same as when she bought her house. Also, I wanted to say, when you appraise our houses and you give us a high amount, yes, it's good, but it's only good if we sell okay. It's not good when we live in it. Also, I'm a widow, so if I sell before I die, I have to pay taxes on all that amount where a married couple gets the double deduction, and that's it. Oh, another question. Everybody else said was you guaranteed us five years. Well, let's have it start now, not last year, because we already. I only. According to my appraisals, I only get it for three years. Well, you already cut one off. If you don't do last year, that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Patricia Monroe, Sharon Lawrence, Shirley Ziner Rexner, but go right ahead. Patricia Monroe. Good morning, members of the county council. My name is Patricia Monroe, president of the South Lawn Citizens association, where we have a large population of retirees. Within the past year, the county has either spent or proposed spending $130 million on property. That money could have funded 13 years of discounts to seniors in the county. Again, the needs of the residents of this county were not considered. In my research, I discovered that seniors in DC get their taxes reduced 50% when they turn 55 based on income, and it does not include the homestead credit. Virginia gives seniors up to 100% off their property taxes at the age of 65 with an income of up to $100,000 per year. There are approximately 61,000 seniors in Prince George's county. That's approximately 15% of the county's population. With the current guidelines that this will probably only apply to no more than 10% of the seniors living in Prince George's County, a county many supported for over 20 years. One of the most significant benefits of tax credits for seniors is the financial relief they provide. Reducing tax liabilities would help seniors afford essential living expenses, like paying for prescriptions, buying food, paying deductibles for office visits, purchasing eyewear and more. It would also help many to stay and age in their homes. Many seniors retired years ago and now have a limited source of income and inflation has outpaced any cost of living they may be receiving. No one knows what the future holds, but this council can help seniors stay in their homes. Imagine your grandparents or parents losing their homes because they can't pay the taxes. I am in support of CB 0007-2024 thank you. Thank you, Sharon Lawrence. And then it's Shirley Braynor. I'm sorry, I couldn't quite read it. Good morning, members of the county council. My name is Sharon Lawrence. I am a board member of the Livingston Woods Homeowners Association, a 30 plus year homeowner and resident of PG County. I am in full support of senior tax credit credit bill CB Zero Zero 720 24. Many states offer no property taxes for seniors 65 or a significant reduction. While this county is struggling to decide whether or not to approve this bill, Prince George's provides incentives to developers that don't even reside in the county, yet they benefit from it when we purchase the homes they built. In Anne Arundel County, a homeowner is eligible for a payment deferral if the owner or at least one of the homeowners has resided in the dwelling for a period of at least five consecutive years, or if they meet one of the following three conditions, at least age 62 or two years of age is disabled or a veteran. Please allow me to share with you a couple of comments I saw on social media regarding the senior tax credit for seniors. Posting number r1. Estate property tax must be be permanently removed for anyone 65 years or older, no matter their income. Too many elders are losing their homes. Posting number two, we should have a safety net for those in need over the age of 65. Posting number three, if student loans can be abolished, so can property taxes for seniors. In closing, I'd like to say I've lived here long enough in this county to learn that PG finds money for anything that are of interest to our officials, whether that be the acquisition of big buildings to support the comfort of executives, or if they are supporting real estate developers, which apparently they can tout as an accomplishment and looks good on a resume.

Please allow me to share with you a couple of comments I saw on social media regarding the senior tax credit for seniors. Posting number r1. Estate property tax must be be permanently removed for anyone 65 years or older, no matter their income. Too many elders are losing their homes. Posting number two, we should have a safety net for those in need over the age of 65. Posting number three, if student loans can be abolished, so can property taxes for seniors. In closing, I'd like to say I've lived here long enough in this county to learn that PG finds money for anything that are of interest to our officials, whether that be the acquisition of big buildings to support the comfort of executives, or if they are supporting real estate developers, which apparently they can tout as an accomplishment and looks good on a resume. I say let's make this bill an interest and not a fight. So I will encourage you to pass the county bill. Thank you. Believe that is. And ma'am, that was Shirley Raynor, right? Sharon Lawrence. Sharon Lawrence. Okay, next is Shirley Raynor. Some things got scratched out on my list, which I'm having trouble reading. Okay. Terry Rumsey. Marietta Brown. John Moore. Good morning. My name is Terry Rumsey. I am a senior. I'll be 70 years old this December. I moved to the county. It'll be five years in June. I'm a widow. I moved here because I too want to age in place, and I was fortunate to find a wonderful deal at National Harbor. I echo everything that has been said, so I won't repeat it. But I will say that unless the county council moves to give us relief, I won't be able to continue to live in PG county. And based on what I heard about Virginia, I may consider moving there. I would love to stay here. I appreciate all that you all have done. I urge you to pass this bill and make further improvements so that I can continue to stay here. Thank you for your work. Thank you. Marietta Brown. John Moore. Wanda Harrison. Is Marietta Brown not present? Okay. John Moore, are you present? Okay, we'll move to Wanda Harrison. Now. I can't read this name so you might have to help me. Is it Toulouse Holmes? Is there a mister and misses Holmes here? Great. You should be a doctor. Good morning. I am Talloras Holmes, a homeowner in Fort Washington, Maryland. Thank you for this opportunity to speak with the chairman and the council members. I support CB Zero zero 720 24. The revised elderly tax credit. Prince George's county is thriving today because of our faith, diligence and strong work ethics. The qualities of our seasoned population significantly contribute. Contributed to the economic growth of Prince George's county. Unfortunately, due to various factors, including the increased property taxes, healthcare, food, transportation, many of us are struggling financially. The full tax credit will provide some financial relief as we try to age in place in Prince George's County. I urge you to support this bill. Council members, each one of you please remember that as every day passes, each one of you is getting older. And in the blink of an eye, you too will be a senior seasoned citizen and need this tax credit. Thank you for your time today. Thank you. Ronald Davis, Charlie Porter and Angela Taylor. Okay, you go ahead and then we'll go back to John. Good morning to the chair and all the county council men and women. And thanks for an opportunity to express myself with the bill or the legislation. CB Zero Zero 720 24. I'm strongly supporting that. I have been living in PG county since I retired from the military. And taxes have gone up considerably since 2093, of course. But I do want to say this bill is a good start. And I think everybody at work paid their dues in a retirement status. They should get a break. It's not cheap with the property tax, as you know. So let's. Let's get a break. Someone that needs the most. If you want to fix income, it can only help pretty much. I just want to support the bill. Thank you. Thank you. And you're Ronald Davis. I'm just making sure. Yes, ma'am. Okay, and let's go back to John Moore. Good morning, council members. My name is John Moore Junior. I live in Fort Washington. I've been in the same house on the same street since 19, 76, 48 years. That's a lot of taxes. The thing that I want to impress upon you is that we as seniors have paid our dues. Some of us are fortunate enough to have our spouses still alive. So that helps us. Helps us a little bit with our finances. But there are lots of us who are widows who are struggling to pay their bills. So I'm encouraging you to do what you need to do necessary to help us out. The street I live on has never been paved, not been in the house for 48 years. Trees are overgrown. No change in the community whatsoever. Again, I'm just encouraging you to think about us as seniors. We've been in this county. We've stayed here when other folks have left and gone to Charles county. We're still here paying these taxes. And I just encourage you to help us out. Thank you. Thank you very much. Charlie Porter. Ma'am, did I skip you? It happened. Angela Taylor. Oh, I did. That's. But Charlie Porter. Well, you might be walking straight up there now because I'm not seeing Charlie Porter. So you go ahead. You're next. Angela Taylor. And then Lisa Moore. Well, good morning. I've been a resident of this county since 1978. That's 46 years now. Being an uneducated consumer in my early years, I used home equity to send each of my three children to college, so I still have a mortgage. My name, as I said, is Angela Taylor, and I live in council medic district number five.

Being an uneducated consumer in my early years, I used home equity to send each of my three children to college, so I still have a mortgage. My name, as I said, is Angela Taylor, and I live in council medic district number five. While my driver's license reads Chevrolet, my property deed reads Villa Heights, my mail reads Heightsville, and my house sits right smack in the middle of Waynesburg. I've never received mailers or other information on election in any other areas I mentioned. So I count very heavily on the office of my council representative to articulate my concerns and to get my issues resolved. And I must say, you have done a very good job. Seniors in my community were very excited that after years of continued property tax hikes, we were going to get some relief. The county government encouraged us to complete the online forum to take advantage of this new benefit. The link that was sent did not work, so I called my and emailed Jolene Ivey's office to secure a proper link. I got an email response with another link that did not allow me to complete the process online. But after a few email exchanges, I got a printable form, completed it, and hand delivered it to this building. I have the county's response, dated October 10, 2023. The Cliff notes version of that letter states that I followed the process and did everything right, but because I get the homestead benefit, I would not get this one. I immediately called Nikki Greco, Jolene Ivory's community liaison, and left a message. What I was told in the letter totally contradicted what was presented to the public, Miss Greco responded a couple of days later. And I asked Nikki to help me understand what happened, because the way the legislation was presented to the community was that this elderly tax relief was in addition to the homestead tax credit. Miss Greco told me that it was hers and Miss Iveys understanding as well. I dont understand why, with a multitude of new businesses cropping up all around the county, how my property taxes continue to rise year after year. My Social Security check hovers around $2,000. I think about us seniors having to sustain ourselves in this county. All of life's necessities, shelter, food, utilities, dental and other medical is killing us, and it's killing us economically, primarily because we live in a capitalistic society. So it's the private folks that do give all these services for profits. This is something that either the federal or state government can control. This piece of legislation, the elderly tax relief bill, is something I believe you can control. Even with having to reapply with this benefit for every five years. It gave me hope that we might be able to live out our lives in Prince George's county. You snatched the rug from out from under us. I'm here to encourage you to put the rug back. Thank you. Next we have Miss Lisa Moore. Miss Moore, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Lisa Moore, and yes, I'm a senior, even though some folks don't think I am. But yes, I was, too denied the elderly tax credit because I did receive that. But I'm not even coming up here to speak today on behalf of myself and my husband. I'm coming up here to speak on behalf of my grandmother. She lived in Fort Washington. She was 99 years old. And it broke my heart, along with the rest of my family members, when that property tax bill came in the mail, and it broke her heart. She received a Social Security payment of $12.75 a month. And if it were not for the family members, she would not be able to live in her house and die in her house. And that is the one thing we all want to do, is to be able to live in our house till the day we die. So I am coming to you on behalf of those who are eighties and nineties and hundreds, because we went to the Centurion luncheon here from PG county, and we looked around and we saw all the those that are so beautifully aged but have to pay that tax. So you think about, like they said before, all the bills that have to come out of that Social Security payment every month, and then to get that $4,000 tax bill is ridiculous. Ridiculous. We got to do better. We have to do better. The God says honor thy mother and thy father. Honor the seniors. Thank you. Thank you. Next we have Miss Vanessa Anderson. Thank you. Good morning. I'm Vanessa Anderson. First of all I'd like to thank you Mister Boris for your perseverance in pursuing the quality of life for seniors in this county. It seems that we continue to be locked out of everything except our pockets and our votes. Okay. After 39 years of public service in Prince George's county, as an educator I shouldn't have to ask or plead for a benefit that so many other jurisdictions freely give to their constituents. We only have to look at our neighbors in DC and look at our neighbors in Virginia as we maneuver our way through cancer culture, CRT and all these other things that are happening. It feels that Prince George's County's denial of this is comparable to what I consider counting jelly beans in a jar, canceling our history, pricing us out of a county that we've lived in and served in for many years. So I come before you to ask you to not deny our contributions for a few dollars, support cb zero zero 720 24 and write a better history for the citizens. Thank you. Next we have Mildred Williams.

Why don't we have you you speak and then walk over here and you can sign up after you speak. Thank you. Please state your name for the record. Name is Bernard E. Robinson. I do appreciate your indulgence as a counsel. I want to say good morning and thank you to the council members here and thanks to our representative, Mister Burroughs. My name is Bernard Robinson and I've lived in Fort Washington, Maryland for the past 38 years and have been a homeowner there for that time. My intent this morning is quite straightforward really it is to express my supports. White simply for CBO 7007-2024 the revised elderly property tax credit legislation. Simply put, the bill, CBO 0724, is an appreciable and positive upgrade over CBO 2922 that was introduced last June for June 22. It is a significant upgrade in that it allows seniors to receive a 20% property tax credit regardless of whether they receive the homestead property tax credit. Already. The change is both welcome and smart. I think there's a host of reasons why, and you've heard many of them already, it is an investment in the economic viability of our county. That's number one. Number two, it will contribute to the ability of our property tax paying senior citizens to have, maintain and sustain a quality of life that is both honorable and fulfilling. It simply makes good economic sense. You see, you should want to support this investment in the quality of life of your citizens, especially your senior citizens, who are among the most stable members of your community. They in fact, will use the savings that this bureau will create to boost the economy of the county in a whole host of other ways. A dollar provided for your senior homeowners means you are positioning the money to be spent on needed services and products with other county businesses. So again, your support of this legislation, and I believe it's wise to do so because it's a win, win win for this county and the citizens of Prince Georgia county. It's a win for the county's economy and its businesses. It's a win for the reputation of the leadership that is provided by yourselves in the governance of our county. And it represents both insight and foresight, in my opinion, of leadership. Number three, it's a win for the seniors in that it helps them stabilize their lives. You actually are contributing to the benefit in the economy of this county. And it's heartening to know that most of the members of this council have already signed on to support or co sponsor this. And finally, in closure, what I've learned is that it is not wise to turn down a win. If I were a county leader, I would find a way to enact cb zero zero 720 24. Because it's a winner. Respectfully submitted to the council by Bernard E. Robinson. I can remember my name. Mister Robinson, if you could go over and sign up. And next, we do have Brenda Mendoza. Please come forward. While she's coming forward, I'd like to acknowledge two delegates who've come today. Delegate Kim Taylor and delegate Jeff Long. I'm sorry I didn't see you earlier. Yes, Miss Mendoza. Okay. Good morning. Or is it afternoon? I'm not sure, but my name is Brenda Mendoza. I'm an army veteran and retired federal financial manager. Since retirement, I've served as a community advocate and volunteer. First on Joint Base Andrews and now in Parkside at West failure. I'll give you an example of how important this is to me. But first, I would like to say that I fully support the revised bill. And. Excuse me, my thanks to those who sponsored this bill because it provides much needed tax relief. Those seniors who qualify this bill, as others have said, is a good start. However, there should be further revisions in future legislation. As a community advocate, I speak for myself and other seniors who might be eligible for the credit if the county had not disqualified us because the assessed value of our homes exceed $500,000. I even question how that number was derived and have expressed my concerns to council member bligh in writing. In effect, the county has created yet another subclass within the senior population and made flawed assumptions. One such assumption is that seniors living in homes valued at more than $500,000 can afford to pay more taxes than their peers, and we should be ineligible for the same tax credits that other seniors enjoy solely because their homes have a higher assessed value. That makes no sense. If tax relief for seniors is truly the goal, I'm requesting that future legislation be fair to all seniors. After you pass this revised bill, and that we. And I'm just making a proposal here because I've heard a lot of issues raised and I. And I fully support those.

I had a very good government job as an executive. I don't have that job anymore. I can't afford these taxes. My hometown of Birmingham, Alabama, has a senior tax credit. Freeze the assessed value of homes for those who qualify for future years. That makes sense if Birmingham can do it, and they call us bamas. But if Birmingham can do it, why can't Prince George's county? If we're seniors, then we're all seniors. Don't create another class within the senior population. Don't consider the haves and the haves not I used to have. I don't have it anymore. I've given all that I can. I volunteer on my own time. I contribute to the community, as do many others. And thank you, all of you, for what you've done to make Prince George's County a better place place to live. I don't want to have to move, but frankly, I'm not going to pay these taxes anymore. I have alternatives. I'd like to stay in my home in Parkside. I built it, I've been there. I want to stay there. But I'll move. I'll go back to Virginia, I'll go back to Birmingham, because frankly, you're not doing enough for us. And I will express my displeasure with my next vote. Thank you. Thank you. Everyone who came to speak today just wanted to make a note that we did pass our budget last week, so this would not be included in the fiscal year 25 budget. It would. It's impossible. I would also like to note that our budget had $171 million deficit that we had to close. We did close it and it's going to be worse next year. So I'm just trying to be honest about where we are right now. But we have definitely heard you and we all want to do all we can to help seniors, and we appreciate you coming out very much when we hear about what's done in DC and, you know, and their $20 billion budget while ours is 5.46, and when we hear that DC has fewer people than we do by a quarter, I'm just trying to put the facts out there. So thank you so much for coming today. May I have a point of information? Sure. Councilmember Burroughs and if everyone could be quiet, even if you're leaving, if you could keep your voices down. Councilmember Burroughs, my question is, when will we take a vote on this? Thank you. We'll have to look at the calendar and see when we can make it happen. Chair, can we vote on it today? Actually, we can't vote on it today. Today's a business meeting, it's not a legislative day. If I can reclaim, you know, we have seniors who made it all this way to get here, and it's not that difficult to inform your council members and the public of when we'll have an opportunity for every council member to vote their conscience. I think it's wrong to continue to, to not be transparent, frankly, about the date of the vote. Mister Burroughs, I believe I've been very transparent and I don't appreciate being told as if I'm not being transparent. I think everyone in this room has their budget that they have to balance, and as responsible members of this council, we have to balance the budget of the whole county. What you're going to do, and we are going to figure out how to do more to help seniors. But we are not voting today on any of these bills in county council because this is a business day. You know that. I wasn't asking for that, I'm asking for some transparency around the date of the vote. I do not know right now, but I will, as usual, inform everyone. It'll be public to know. So we're going to vote on it. We vote on every single bill. We are not trying to hide our votes because you gave a big explanation about the county budget and the crisis that we're in. That sound like more like an argument against the bill. And Mister Burroughs, I hear many times things that we would like to give people and then you. But I never hear where the money's going to come from. You have the right to vote for conscience. I just want every member to. We have a responsibility to balance a budget. We actually voted on confirmations today. I said an I for confirmation. Confirmation. So how can we vote on confirmations and not vote on this bill? The budget is an issue that maybe we should just vote and everybody vote how they feel. Excuse me, Miss Plague, Miss Gresham, would you like to take that question? Yes, madam chair. To vote, to act upon a bill, you have to act upon a bill on a legislative day. Today is a business meeting. So you can introduce a bill or enact a bill on a legislative day. But other matters, as far as public hearings and confirmations, you can vote on that, or correspondence, but you cannot introduce or enact a bill if it is not a legislative day.

But other matters, as far as public hearings and confirmations, you can vote on that, or correspondence, but you cannot introduce or enact a bill if it is not a legislative day. But just a follow up question. Last year, I've only been on this council for two years, and I've never had a public hearing where we did not vote right after the public hearing. I've never had a public hearing on the bill. This is like the first time for me. I expected to vote. I expected to vote today. And if the discussion is about the bill, I don't understand why the bill is coming up if we're not voting today. I agree with councilmember Burroughs. Let's vote our conscience. I vote yes on this, and I would like to vote. Matt Gaye. Today you actually cannot vote. So you can. You can speak. You have certainly made your position clear. But you may not vote today because this is not a legislative day. I mean, the vote we. Miss Russell, did you have further words to say? We were given by the council administration that today, may 28, we should bring our voters out. We brought our voters out, let them know to come to see us vote. And I kind of feel bad that all of the residents that I brought here. I'm sorry, because I thought we were going to be voting today in your presence. And now I feel kind of tricked, because now we found out that it's a business act. I've never had a public hearing and not been able to vote. Miss Bligh, please. I am never 100% sure that we have had business days and that we have had bills that we have not voted on. You might not remember it because you didn't particularly pay attention to particular business. Well, I would not pay attention when I was vice chair last year. So that's really insulting to me, Miss Blagey. That is really insulting to me. No, I'm not trying to vice chair on this council. That is not even right for you to say that I would be paying attention. Please stop. We all have certain, we have a lot of bills to come before us and some are more important to individuals up here than others. That is not an insult. But we, but you, it was your choice to ask people to come out on it because it was a public hearing. It's a business day. It's been listed as a business day for weeks. So I'm sorry that you missed that, Miss Oregon. And please, please quiet down. Please quiet down. Miss Oriada, if we know as a compromise to the conversation today, the next legislative day, we could now commit to have this on the agenda that day, to vote on it. Is that something that the leadership would be amenable to? We've already have the agenda set and I can't remember when this one was set for, but we will check and I will certainly let you know so that you can let people know. Mister vice chair. So 1st first I want to take the opportunity to thank everyone to be a part of this process in this public hearing. Hello. So I just want to take the opportunity. I'm sorry, Mister vice chair, madam chair, can you call the chamber? Order. Thank you. Thank you. Look, I just want to take the opportunity to thank everyone who came out today to testify on the public hearing, just to take time to express your thoughts, your concerns, the action of what this body needs to do. It was greatly appreciated. So I just want to have the opportunity to express that, but also to my colleagues as soon as we get that date, I'll be sure, we'll be sure to make sure that you can actually let the public know as well as we do when we're going to vote on this. I think, you know, I understand the sensitivity of this right now. I'm going to be honest, it's good to see that everyone came out because during our budget process, we did not have this room packed, that we just passed a $5.46 billion budget that literally had $171 million hold. So I'm encouraged by the fact that the public came out to testify and speak today, but we are still in the middle of a $405 million deficit right now. Now. But we have to weigh everything. Every voice needs to be heard. We need to weigh what needs to happen. How do we move forward? How do we not lose our triple a bond rating? Things of that nature that are all go to the sensitivity of the decision making that we make as a body. And so, madam chair, as soon as we get the date, let's make sure our colleagues have it so we can allow the public to be a part of that process. Again, thank you very much, Mister Burroughs. I want to just remind the body that this passed out a committee well before the budget was passed and could have been enacted before the budget was passed. I also want to say, while I know that the county is struggling, I can tell you that the senior citizens in the county are struggling, and they deserve the dignity to age in place. They are on fixed incomes, deciding literally between food, medication, and basic bills. And so I ask that we get sufficient notice for when the vote will be. I don't understand why we can't announce today that it will be at our next legislative meeting. We do additions packages all the time. When developers want things, we do an additions package. And so I was just please, everyone remember about please being quiet. I'm sure you want to hear, Mister Burroughs, what", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Municipality Bodies", "insights": [{"observation": "Many residents were brought out under the impression they would be able to vote today, but it was clarified that voting can only occur on a legislative day.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "There is a discussion about setting the next legislative day to vote and keeping the public informed of that date.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The importance of public participation and the need for transparency in the legislative process was highlighted.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The council has passed a $5.46 billion budget with a $171 million hole, and they are currently dealing with a $405 million deficit.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Concerns were raised about preserving the municipality's triple A bond rating.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Senior citizens on fixed incomes are struggling, having to choose between food, medication, and basic bills.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Municipality Bodies", "insights": [{"observation": "Many residents were brought out under the impression they would be able to vote today, but it was clarified that voting can only occur on a legislative day.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "There is a discussion about setting the next legislative day to vote and keeping the public informed of that date.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The importance of public participation and the need for transparency in the legislative process was highlighted.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The council has passed a $5.46 billion budget with a $171 million hole, and they are currently dealing with a $405 million deficit.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Concerns were raised about preserving the municipality's triple A bond rating.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Senior citizens on fixed incomes are struggling, having to choose between food, medication, and basic bills.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 6262962, "chunk_end_time": 6684086, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3587?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3587?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=6262"}, {"start": 84000, "end": 90000, "text": "y.

This public hearing has been held, and next we will go to the next briefings, which is council member workgroup updates, Chesapeake Bay and Water resources policy committee. Councilmember Burroughs, please be quiet as you're leaving. If you're leaving. The Chesapeake Bay Water Resource Policy committee update. The chair is a member out of Montgomery County. Chair Gonzalez opened up a meeting on May 17. During that conversation, there was communication about the water workforce diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. There were members. Excuse me, Mister Burroughs, if I could remind everyone to please, please leave quietly. Thank you. Or stay and listen, but please be quiet. There were member and staff updates to include highlights around the EPA summit on May 16. We also, the committee also engaged in conversations about the one water art contest, the Anacostia river tour. There's also information about Chesapeake. Again, everyone could please stop talking speaking while you're leaving. Thank you so much. On June 1 through the 19th. I mean, sorry, through the 9th. And I'll just hand this report to the clerk because I'm not sure people care about this. We care deeply about the Chesapeake. Okay. We will now go to council of governments, board of directors, council members Durnoga and Watson. Thank you. I don't have a report at this time, madam Chair. Unfortunately, they moved this to a May 1 meeting at the Mayflower Hotel. If you may recall, I was out sick that week, so I was unable to attend. So I don't have to make the meeting. Okay. Council of Government Transportation Planning Board, councilmember Olson and I did forget to recognize former council member Sam Dean. So I'm sorry about that. Yes. Transportation Planning Board met on the 15th, May 15, and there was, this was on the SIP, the improvement plan, and the air quality conformity. This was the projects, the road projects and rail projects that would go into the regional plan that make them eligible for federal funding. We have, Prince Roosevelt county took the lead in holding up the south side project, which would put rail, would prevent rail on the Wilson Bridge by putting Virginia's toll lanes on the Wilson Bridge. We have held that up. The county executive's DPWT representative and myself with our Maryland colleagues held that off, and we will have a vote on that in a month. Well, now it's been a couple weeks, but we have significant concerns. I know this body has had significant concerns about the south side project. The other things that happened there were that MDOT did remove the east side. They call it the east side, the Beltway along the east side, the study for toll lanes and Beltway widening for toll lanes throughout Prince George's county, and they called it the east side. That's a position that we have had as a body for a long time, and we are successful in getting that out. We also supported Charles county in the southern Maryland Rapid transit with language around that, being supportive, although that wasn't quite ready to be in the plan at this time. So more to come in the weeks ahead. Thank you, madam chair. Thank you. Next we have. Oh, I'm sorry, mister vice chair. Madam chair. I definitely. When you get a chance, I'd like to give an EDC update, too, because I serve on that board, and both of us were at that last board meeting. So go right ahead, Miss Fisher. Thank you, council member Olson, for your support service on that. I was wondering when it came to the, I'm sorry, the toll lane, I think the, that lane, and I know you said us and the county executive have been against that right. Is there like an official position that we take? And I know I've gotten a lot of email correspondence from my district about it, and I was just wondering, like, is there's anywhere I can direct them with, with our response to that? I've gotten a lot of emails else. Yes, we have. Last year, the council did, I believe we did pass a letter that included opposition to that. Yeah, that was critical of that. And we certainly, when we had secretary Weitefeld here, we expressed our concern about it as well. So we've been pretty consistent, consistently critical of that project. Yeah. I mean, it would move the traffic back up into Prince George's county from Virginia, number one. I mean, that's one thing, and there's a lot of other problems with it. Thank you, Vice chair Harrison, Edc. Thank you, colleagues. We had the opportunity to meet about three weeks ago, the chair of my, myself, and had the opportunity to meet with David Ayanucci and the leadership team of EDC.

But that's kind of the gist of the meeting, knowing how we, we can continue to bring businesses to Prince George's county. The focus also was the ICSC conference that some of us had the opportunity to attend. But I would encourage my colleagues as well to continue to work with EDC when it comes to your prospective districts to work on some of the business plans and strategy to bring type of businesses we need in the county. Thank you. Thank you. And I have a report. I chair the climate, energy and environment policy committee for the Council of Governments. And we did last November. We adopted regional solar goals of 250,000 solar rooftops in the region by 2030. So the focus of this meeting that we had last week was discussing new opportunities for solar. There are grants that have been, that have been announced, and we'll make sure that the ones that are ahead of us that Prince George's county does apply for. And we also had Wamada sustainability update where we heard about how Metro's board adopted strategic transformation plan and goals to provide an ongoing framework to promote sustainability and guide long term policy and investment decisions. So that is what happened at what we call CPC. And let's see. We will now call for a motion to adjourn. Did I miss you? Oh, that's because I was calling you, but then you had a question, so let's. I do not want to skip you. Human Services and Public safety policy committee. Thank you. Our committee continues to meet every month. Last month we they actually went over the annual count for the DMV for homelessness. Every single jurisdiction in the DMV has sadly gone up for us. We had 326 individuals in 2023 that were facing homelessness. For this year, they have us at 345. In 2024, we didn't have the most drastic increase, but it's there. We also had our foster care like appreciation month. Just highlighting folks in the DMV who have been really doing great job in foster care people. We also wanted to point this out and also direct this to the county execs liaisons on this update for them. The Housing Affordability planning program grant opened May 1 and it closes July 1. And last year, pointing to Eric, the purple line, our purple line housing was a recipient of about 75k. So I wanted to make sure that our county fourth floor was aware of the housing affordability program. I'm sure they are. And we had a presentation from our very own. She did a great job. Renee Esner Pope did a presentation about what we're doing here in Prince George's county about the local effort to end youth homelessness, and she presented that for all the CoG members. So homelessness was our focus on housing. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate that. Before we for a brief break, I want to announce that we were about to have committee of the whole when we return. I was about to say that that would start at 1130, but apparently that time has already passed. So when we return from a break, we'll have committee of the whole. Then after that the board of health is scheduled for 130. And as a few reminders, on Thursday, May 30 at 10:00 a.m. we have tie committee at 130. GOFP on Monday, June 3, we have 930 agenda briefing 10:00 district council meeting 130 p head meeting Tuesday, June 4 930 Agenda Briefing 945 District Council 10:00 County Council 130 Committee of the whole and 06:00 the county council will have a joint public hearing on the Blair Smith Flynn Stack houses historic site designation.

Curry Administration Building, Largo, Maryland 20774. Do we have some elected officials present? I believe we have a couple. We have Charles Colbert, Upper Marlboro would you like to lead us off tonight? Good evening. Good evening chair Ivey, vice chair Harrison, members of the county council, my name is Charles Colbert and I currently have the privilege of serving as a commissioner on the Town of Upper Marlboro Board of Town Commissioners. Since 2017, the Prince George's County Capital Improvement Plan budget has included a line item and project page within the redevelopment authority's budget for $2.5 million to be allocated for redevelopment activities in the downtown corridor of the Town of Upper Marlboro. Also since 2017, that funding profile has slipped to the right each year with the passage of the annual budget and, as of the current proposed budget standard, to not be initially dispersed until fiscal year 2028. I stand before you today formally requesting that the council accelerate this timeline and begin appropriating the funding in FY 25 the town is in need of investment and support in revitalizing the downtown corridor in order to attract businesses to the community and to better provide services amenities for the residents within and surrounding the town. Currently, 64% of the town's landmass is untaxable government owned property, which hinders our ability to collect adequate revenue to fund revitalization efforts. We're essentially providing services for a population that swells tenfold during business hours on 40% of the potential revenue. However, the town has invested resources in undergoing a vision planning process for downtown redevelopment. We've engaged residents and contracted with an economic development firm to provide expert guidance on what and how we can make positive change to impact the residents, not only of the town, but the greater upper Marlboro area. That firm solicited input from residents in and out of town businesses and property owners, elected officials at the state and county level, and anyone else who had a vested interest in the town and was willing to provide input. Last year, the town board of Commissioners approved the town's vision plan, providing avenues for commercial revitalization, increased housing availability and recreation. These avenues include streetscape redesign for pedestrian and vehicle safety, main street reconfiguration and revitalization of old and abandoned buildings for mixed use development. The town shares the county's goal of diversifying revenue streams and expanding the commercial base to relieve the burden on individual taxpayers. This investment in the town's revitalization efforts provides a significant return to the county in helping to meet this goal and in providing revenue from previously untaxed sources. Releasing this funding and partnering with the county agencies will allow the town to make significant progress toward these initiatives, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss any of these matters further, and I leave this for your consideration. Thank you for your time and this opportunity. Thank you very much. And I believe Mister de Nova has audio now. Would you like to introduce yourself, please? Thank you. Tom Denova, council District one, Northern Triangle okay, I'm going to read the next four names and if you hear yours, start getting ready so that you don't have to wait in between Janet Gingell, Leah Schuller, Rashid Abdurrahman and Joe Parks. Are any of those people present? Well, come on down. Okay, Janet. But Janet Gingold is not present. I can't see because I only have on one contact today. Okay, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Sorry. Are you Leah Schuler? Okay. Good evening, council members. My name is Leah Schuller. I am a district four homeowner shelter volunteer and a love Paws rescue volunteer. The actions of love paws are driven by data and facts. As an organization focused on community outreach, we aim to keep pets in their homes and prevent them from entering shelters. We have identified a significant need for support services that can help pet owners and reduce the number of animals ending up in the overcrowded shelter. We are currently running a county wide pet pantry program as part of our efforts, but we face challenges in partnering with the county shelter to jointly address owner surrenders. This is mainly due to insufficient resources at the shelter and the lack of funding for such critical initiatives. We believe that organizations like ours need dedicated sources of grants through the shelter or council. If you could pull the mic a little bit closer. Sure, I can hear you, but it would be louder. Is that better? It is. Okay. There we go. Or council members to support our work and help reduce the burden on shelters.

Organizations such as Dallas Pets Alive, which have similar objectives, serve as a beacon of hope but seem unattainable for our organization due to limited resources. It is essential for the county council to recognize the importance of supporting shelter funding in order to make a real difference in reducing shelter intake and helping pets and their families. Our rescue efforts focus on helping PG pit bulls as well as other dogs and cats in need at the shelter. These animals often come from underprivileged communities and we are committed to providing them with a chance for better lives. It is disappointing to see our county executive looking into fully enforcing the ban. Instead of focusing on more effective solutions. We strongly oppose groups of specific bans which are not rooted in data or science, but rather fear mongering. Instead of enforcing these bans, our county should invest in common sense legislation that prevents dangerous animals from becoming at large, imposing public threats. We believe that the pit bulls are not the problem. It is about responsible adoption and ensuring that all dogs, regardless of breed, receive proper care and attention. The shelter could benefit greatly by working with rescue partners to develop a responsible in county adoption policy. However, this would require additional funding for staffing and resources, which can be achieved through more efficient use of taxpayer money. By investing in such initiatives, we can help solve the problems related to pet ownership and reduce the burden on our shelters. Thank you. Thank you very much. Rashid Abdurrahman and Joe Parks. Good evening, council. Thank you for having me. I am chef Rashid Abdur Rahman. I'm the executive chef at Food and Friends. I'm also a longtime resident of Prince George's County. I currently reside in Glendale, Maryland and I'm a graduate of Central High School class of 1981. I have been working as a chef for 30 years and I've been with food and friends since 2019. One reason I joined food and friends is that from its conception, it's an organization that focuses on providing nutritionally nutritional meals to people living with illnesses in our community. Food and friends home delivers medically tailored meals to people who need when they need it, while they need living with serious illnesses. Our meals provide the nourished sorry, I can't read with my glasses. Our meals provide the nourishment they need with the hope that they will get better. This allows them to focus on their health. 26% of our clients live in Prince George's county and I'm proud that my work through food and friends can contribute to assisting them in the time of need. And in the past years few years while doing my work, I've experienced higher food costs and I'm sure as we all have, but for us, it's been about 20% increase on many items. In addition, I've experienced difficulty with food shortages and additional gas charges from all of our vendors, some of them as much as $50, just to bring us a delivery. These days, I spend a great deal of my time sourcing ingredients and attempting to find affordable pricing on foods. We try very hard to source our ingredients from local farms and producers to support the local economy and sustain resilient food system for everyone. Demand for our services has grown by almost 75% in the last five years. Last year, we delivered 1.9 million meals to over 5500 people across the region, and this is at no cost to them. More than 495,680 of those clients meals were home delivered to almost 1400 Prince George's county clients and their families. Through our client survey, our clients tell us that their health has improved and that they're better able to follow their doctor's orders. Research shows our clients have fewer emergency room visits and hospital stays, which is very important as we have some of the longest emergency room times in the county. All of the grants we received from Prince George's county pay for just a small portion of the total cost we support to take care of our neighbors. So, in closing, I want to thank you all for your past support and that you provided to the food and friends. And I recognize a lot of faces here because I know you've all, you know, many of you have volunteered there, so thank you for that. And I just ask that as you consider the budget, consider food and friends, and the support that we do to the community and the great impact that we have on the citizens here. So thank you very much.

We were struggling physically. We began to struggle emotionally. Life began to seem like a downward trajectory with one struggle after another piling on. But it's interesting, sometimes when life seems to be closing in on you, a reason for hope unexpectedly appears. A social worker found that we were eligible for food in France. At first, I wondered whether I should even, you know, feel happy about it, because it really seemed too good to be true. But then the food began to arrive. You can taste the love. You can taste the compassion that has gone into the preparation, the delivery, and the follow up support with food in France. This young man, Raj, who delivers the food, is always brimming with just wonderful energy. When he delivers the food, you could think that, oh, I must be the first and the last person he'll see all day. He's just giving me all his energy. You know, the food is so varied, so delicious and so nutritious that I actually feel a little emotional when I eat it. When I was a little boy, I would almost never eat carrots. There were so many times that my mom so lovingly prepared a meal that I didn't appreciate. Now it is as though angels are returning on my mother's behalf, always with lots of carrots. But the food and friends carrots are delicious. They are never soft and soggy. And I don't understand. Whoops. Oh, my God. And I don't understand. I can't believe I tried to turn around. Don't understand how carrots could be seasoned to taste so good, but I eat every morsel. Now, the food is very, very healthy, but I have never had a very healthy relationship with food. I've always eaten too much of what is not good for me and not enough of what is good for me. I'm 74 and I'm pretty set in my ways. My mother and my father both suffered from diabetes. Before food and friends, I was prediabetic. I was kind of feeling that the writing was on the wall. But then I started having nutritional counseling sessions with Jen Krasilovsky. Miss Krasilovsky has enabled me to change my relationship with myself and in this way, to change my relationship with food. Although Jen is completely professional, I could feel her compassion for me. And when she asked me again and again to describe my eating habits, Jen would inevitably end up somehow being able to hear my emotional side. The emotional aspect of my relationship with food. Jen never, ever lectured me. Jen would always ask questions so patiently and so compassionately that I began to perceive on my own how my own anger and frustration with myself was causing me not to care enough about myself to eat properly. Somehow I. Mister Parks, are you about done? The timing. I used to have prostate problems. You have to get up three to five times a night. All that kind of stuff. Even that has gone. Sorry. Thank you. It's quite all right. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. That's Joe Murchison. Amy Olivo. Here you go. I am Joe Murkison, and I'm treasurer of streetcar suburbs Publishing, a 20 year old nonprofit that publishes three monthly newspapers in Prince George county, the Hyattsville Life and Times, the college park here and now, and the Laurel Independent. Altogether, these papers are mailed to almost 50,000 households, which means they potentially reach 100,000 adult residents in those households. I'm here to ask for $25,000 in non departmental grant money to keep that circulation at that level at a time of rising printing and mailing costs. We are very grateful for the past two years of similar grants. Our grant letter goes into specifics about how the grant will allow the Laurel independent, one of the three papers, to continue to be delivered to more than 13,000 homes outside the municipality of Laurel. That's close to 30% of our chain's total circulation. But rather than spend time going into those specifics, I would like to just take a minute to look at the big picture. Research shows that newspapers are important in building social capital in communities, boosting voter turnout, creating good business climates, and promoting civic engagement. But as is the case throughout the country, the local newspaper industry has been in a tailspin. You may remember the following newspapers. The Prince George's Journal, the Prince George's Sentinel, the Gazette Papers, the Bowie Blade, and the Laurel Leader they were formerly leading local, nonprofit, for profit newspapers in the county. They're all gone except for the Sentinel, which is now only online and mostly carries articles about Montgomery County. A few longstanding newspapers survived the Greenbelt News Review, Beltsville News and Inquirer Gazette. Their combined circulation is about 25,000, half of the circulation of streetcars papers. So streetcar is now the biggest game in town for Prince George's newspapers. We exist mostly because of volunteer writers at each paper. I was a paid professional journalist at one time in my life at one of the defunct papers, but now I'm an unpaid volunteer like our other writers. Our budget pays part time salaries for some editors and administrators, but it's a shoestring operation, kind of a miracle, I think, in today's media environment. In closing, I hope you can help keep us alive and keep us healthy. Healthy building social capital in Prince George's county. Thank you. Thank you.

Amy Olivo, Suyana Linhales Barker and Officer Carlos Plazas. Good evening chair Ivey, vice chair Harrison and members of the Prince George's county council. My name is Amy Olivo and I'm the executive director of artworks, now located at 4800 Rhode Island Avenue in Hyattsville. Greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you this evening to share more about artworks, as well as to ask for your support in the fiscal year 2025 budget. At Artworks now, we envision a world where all people explore and engage in creative practices that transform their lives and their communities. We build and nurture community through inclusive visual arts and social justice experiences with our guiding values of compassion, equity, inclusion, integrity and joy. It's very hard to believe, but later this month I'll actually mark my two year anniversary at artworks. Now I feel incredibly lucky to experience wonder and awe every day at our building, where stooges students ages two through 92 develop their artistic skills, expand their self esteem and experience so much joy. Program fees cover only 40% of our budget at artworks. We depend on government and private grants, as well as corporate and individual donations to fund 60% of our work. Our MNC PPC project charge funding of $35,000 and non departmental grant funding of 20,000 directly supports programs, including our free creative aging classes for those 55 or better. If Mister park had stayed, I was going to invite him to join us, him and his wife at those a free art club after school at Thomas Stone elementary in Mount Rainier. They support scholarships to make our summer camps more affordable for more families and a free class for teens this spring to learn about public art and design, design a new mural, and so much more. Our creative aging program, specifically, again free for adults 55 or better, is specifically designed to address anxiety, depression and loneliness through the development of creative skills and social engagement in older adults. In 2024, we will serve more than 400 older adults across all of Prince George's county through more than 24 different classes in in person and online. There's no doubt in my mind that creative aging has quite literally saved lives, especially during the height of the pandemic. Even as we've returned to in person classes for all other ages, we've kept some of our virtual creative aging classes to ensure that they're accessible for Prince Georgians who are not able to travel to our building for a myriad of reasons. This spring, as I mentioned, we have 15 teens participating in a free teen mural class. Over the next two months, they're learning about public art, and then they will design and paint a new mural at our building. Since their teens, we're also feeding them from next door, the pizza place next door. We've been able to continue and expand this important work thanks to our project, charge funding and our non departmental grant, and ask for that support again this year. Thank you to Yana Linhales Barker and then officer Carlos Plazas and Marcel Graham. Good evening. I'm representing also Carlos Plazas, so I'm both in one. You still only get three minutes. Yeah. Jolene Ivy and costume members and Hansi staff my name is Suyanda Liandes Barker and I'm the chief of programs and community services. La clinica del Pueblo La clinica del Pueblo, like the people's Clinic, is a federalified health center in DC, located in Hyattsville since 2016, but we've been in DC for the last 41 years. Latlinka provides culturally, linguistically appropriate medical, mental medical, mental health and community health services, and I'm here because of the pending cuts on the health assures program, which would impact deeply La clinicas and other federal qualified health centers ability to care for and to give care to our patients. Health assures is a vital revenue source for the health centers in the newest Prince George county budget, we don't see dollars allocated the same way that was last year. Even the current amount, like the 5 million that was allocated until now, was not enough to funding all the uninsured clients that were seeing in Prince George county, not only La Clinica, but other federal qualified health centers. Health services for the uninsured requires a long term funding commitment to prevent and treat multiple health conditions. Having the fund for a while and then losing the funding can put in job or the other capacity to keep treating people that we were able to provide services since the pandemic started. Facing now a post pandemic challenge. Our patients are hardworking people who are integral to the county's construction, service, and healthcare industry. Many of them work in hospitals, doctor's office, nursing homes, childcare facility. Those patients come to United States to escape poverty, violence, the lack of opportunity.

Thank you for your time. Thank you. Marcel Graham and then doctor Jerry Lewis. Great. Hi, I'm Doctor Graham. Close enough. Markel Graham. That is. Welcome, esteemed members of the county council and chair Ivey. I'm Doctor Graham with the University of Maryland Educational Opportunity center. Don't hold that against me. You know, we're actually community based, located in Riverdale. Although we crisscross the county, we say from Louie down to Akakee, helping families, primarily first generation, low income families. We say from 19 to 99, although we do see high school seniors, we're out there trying to help them skill up, re enroll, finish their geds, you name it. We have partnerships with the community college, with Prince, employ Prince George's department of social services. We've been doing this work for a long time, but we continue to need the support of you all in order to do the work. We actually. It's kind of tough out there. I don't know if you've heard about the problem with the FAFSA. Well, we're right there with those families trying to spend 6 hours completing them with those glitches and all that wonderful stuff. So we definitely need you all as much as possible helping us to reach those families. And they keep coming back and coming back, and we love helping them, but we certainly need help on our end. So we're just requesting continued non departmental support in the $40,000, and that'll go a long ways. So we just want to thank you all for your support over the years. And thank you again. Thank you. Next we have doctor Jerry Lewis, then Joel Solozano and Miss Emmy Ayala. Doctor Lewis and Joel will not be here. Okay. Thank you. Miss Emmy Ayala. And then Yolanda Johnson. Good evening to the Prince George's county council. Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak this evening. My name is Emmy Ayala. I am a volunteer for the Prince George's county animal shelter for the past 13 years and a volunteer and former animal foster parent for the SPCA Humane Society of Prince George's county and a resident of Prince George's county for 23 years in district two of Hyattsville. I'm sure that many of you on the council and in this audience have had a pet or companion animal that has changed your life for the good, or you currently have a pet that you cherish, that is part of your family. If you have had the good fortune of being the recipient of the unconditional love of an animal, then you know how profound the bond is and how sentient and intelligent animals are. I say all this so you can be sure to prioritize budgetary dollars so that animals at the shelter can receive the best possible care, ensure adequate staffing at the shelter, and plentiful resources to improve the lives of animals at the shelter. Life for an animal at a high intake shelter can be extremely stressful and overwhelming. Imagine if an animal you knew was at the shelter. Currently, only certain kinds of toys are permitted and blankets are not being distributed or are rationed. While some blanket rationing is a result of trying to prevent disease, if there were adequate funding available, then blankets and towels could be washed off site or higher volume machines could be installed at the shelter to ensure that the animals could receive the comfort of a blanket. If only one out of three animals make it out alive of the shelter, should they at least not have the warmth and comfort of a blanket and a toy to play with, the shelter should be a source of pride for the county, and the lives of homeless animals can and should be improved. How we treat our animals is a significant reflection on us as a society. Additionally, customer service is of extreme importance at a large shelter that is a county facility paid for by taxpayers. We often hear that phone calls go unanswered and that it is very difficult to reach the shelter. When lives are at stake and the public wants to help animals, then phones should be answered promptly. Adequate staffing will ensure that phones are answered, inquiries are addressed, and the shelter is known for providing outstanding customer service to the community it serves. To conclude, I beg you to please end BSL. This is a pointless, outdated, inhumane legislation that harms the animals and citizens of Prince George's county. This legislation has no place in a modern county, in a large metropolitan area, or anywhere else for that matter.

Thank you so much for this opportunity. Thank you. Yolanda Johnson. Corzon Saylor, Denise Albright. Thank you. Good evening. This is National Foster Care Awareness Month, and we are here representing national foster care awareness, but also child abuse prevention. We would like for you all to engage in supporting child abuse prevention through supporting Casa court appointed special advocates, as you know us, has been around for over 20 years. I am proud to serve as the executive director for the past one year, and tomorrow I celebrate my one year anniversary. I'm Yolanda Johnson. I'm also a graduate of Bowie State University, so it makes me even more excited to serve in this capacity. Over the past 20 years, through strong partnerships with the juvenile court and the Department of Social Services, we have been able to provide best interest advocacy to over 200 youth here in the county. Thank you all for all of your support throughout the years. Thank you, most recently for your support for our guaranteed income program, where we are now able to serve 50 young people who have aged out of foster care. And we're able to help them stabilize as adults here in the county. Tonight, I'm here to ask you for your support of our $100,000 non departmental grant application. Each year, there are almost 500 youth in care here in the county. We're able to serve 200 of those youth, and that's amazing. But I do have a plan to move that needle forward and close that gap over the next few years. In order to do that, I need your support to do that. Thank you so much for your consideration. Thank you. Horizon sailor Denise Albright. Good evening, council members. My name is Corzanne Saylor. I am a Detroit native, but I'm a proud Prince George's county resident for the past 13 years. I actually started out as a CasA volunteer in 2012 and has since then moved from a volunteer to a fellow board member. And I come to you today representing our board. As my executive director stated, with the help of DSS, of course, Department of Social Services, and our other community partners, KASA has been able to serve and provide resources for over 200 kids throughout the county that have been affected by the foster care system. I think it's important to note that these are not just numbers. This is not just data. These are not just volunteers looking for community service hours. These are not just dates and times that we put on different books, but please know that these are lives that are being affected with each budget cut or each time we don't reinstate a grant that is a loss of a child's life. These are, again, these are real lives that are being affected. This is another type of nonprofit that's seeking to help children, and you can't really track the dollars and track its impact. Casa has serious impact over the years. And again, it's important to note that we're not just a local or county nonprofit. We are a national organization. But we today are coming, asking you again, and imploring and humbly asking that you do please reconsider, are not departmental funding requests of the 100K, because, again, it is not just data. It's not just numbers. These are actual lives of children that we have seen, that we have personally worked with, that are being affected by every dollar that has been cut. So, again, thank you so much for your support throughout the years. And in closing, I just want to take a brief moment to ask the council members, not by show of hands, but just if you could reflect for a moment anyone that you may know, maybe yourselves and your family, that has been either directly or indirectly affected by the foster care system. About four or five years ago, there was a family of four children and a single mother. And since 2011, they had social workers come into the home, and they marked those kids as safe year over, year over, year over year, up until they were not safe, and all four children were found dead in their homes. So, again, I hate to be so dark, but this is important. This is real. It's time to stop deep diving in shallow water. This is real. We need dollars. We need your funding. We need your support. Thank you so much. Thank you. Denise Albright, then Angela Ayala Roberts panchera. Good evening. First and foremost, I must say that I'm here in my personal capacity as a volunteer with Casa and not for my place of employment. So, good evening. My name is Denise Albright, and I've been a Casa volunteer for the past two years. I chose to volunteer with the Casa of Prince George's county because I wanted to give back to the community they gave to me as a child, I was a victim of similar trauma that some of our youth and care have experienced. And because of the support of Prince George's county support services and its court system, I was able to grow to become a productive citizen with a thriving family. Through Casa, I received a case supervisor. They guided me every step of the way.

So, again, I hate to be so dark, but this is important. This is real. It's time to stop deep diving in shallow water. This is real. We need dollars. We need your funding. We need your support. Thank you so much. Thank you. Denise Albright, then Angela Ayala Roberts panchera. Good evening. First and foremost, I must say that I'm here in my personal capacity as a volunteer with Casa and not for my place of employment. So, good evening. My name is Denise Albright, and I've been a Casa volunteer for the past two years. I chose to volunteer with the Casa of Prince George's county because I wanted to give back to the community they gave to me as a child, I was a victim of similar trauma that some of our youth and care have experienced. And because of the support of Prince George's county support services and its court system, I was able to grow to become a productive citizen with a thriving family. Through Casa, I received a case supervisor. They guided me every step of the way. They engaged me in comprehensive training, and because of that training, I was able to effectively complement the efforts of the Department of Social Services directly. With Casa's guidance and support, I was able to help my assigned youth learn to budget their money, ensure good work ethic, support them in building credit, participate in therapy sessions to deal with the trauma that they've experienced, and to ultimately help them transition out of care smoothly for my youth. I was able to work with DSS to support my youth application to Bowie State University and to ultimately pack them up from their foster care home and unpack them in their college dorm room. Because of Kata's support, the quote unquote system worked as intended for this young person. They didn't experience the horror stories that we've all heard about when it comes to youth care. Because of Casa's support, the system of care worked. From the court magistrate, to DSS, to in state college, to Casa, to the foster care mother that opened her home and took a chance on supporting a child's life. We all surrounded this young man with support from every angle. Because of Casa support, I was able to give back and make a difference in the life of a young person in this county like me. A young man that has every reason to go left, but is now, to this day, choosing to go right. A young man that has a positive trajectory for his future. And I shudder to think what it would be without the coordinated care and without the cost of Prince George's county. So, from a volunteer deeply committed to supporting the young people in this county, I encourage you to increase and sustain optimal funding for this organization. The return of investment for every youth supported by this CaSA is priceless. Volunteers like myself and our time don't cost the county anything. Instead, CASA needs the support to ensure comprehensive, multi week CASa trainings for volunteers, case supervisors to support these volunteers and to ensure that someone answers the next call for support of a child in need of assistance. Thank you. Thank you. Angela Ayala, Robert Panuchira, and Javier Aguilar. Good evening, council members. I hope you're all having a wonderful evening. My name is Andrea Ayala, student of Liberty's promise and currently a student at Parkdale High School. I would like to start this off by saying thank you to Mister Omar for giving me this opportunity to be able to speak on behalf of Liberty's promise. Even though I've only been a student at Parkdale for a year, I've been able to find refuge in a foreign land. I would also like to give kudos to doctor Robert Ponticherra. Throughout my time at Liberty's promise, it's given me so much motivation to keep pushing to do my best in school and it's also granted me many perspectives on life. It is by far the best program I have attended and I do see the positive impact it is doing, not just to me, but for those who are also a part of this community. We all share laughs, express our feelings, and together have created something that Mister Omar would call family. During my short time within this community, I created a few bonds and friendships with my fellow peers. I'm not one to socialize much, but this has been something to me that allows me to be me. I get to share my own knowledge about certain things ive learned throughout my time in high school, but also the things ive dealt with outside of high school. I try my best to make it through the day and as it comes to the end, im always looking forward to attending the program. I hope that Libertys promise keeps going on forever to improve the lives of others and help them have a better understanding of life in school. During my time in this community, they motivate you to follow your dreams and achieve your goals in life. And no matter how rocky things can get, you can always confide with your sponsor. Not only do they teach you about life, they help you find ways to better your resume, find a job, do more research about colleges, do online simulations about how it would be as a college student or how to manage your money. They help you with everything you need. I'm extremely grateful this program was created. Thank you Mister Omar, and thank you Doctor Robert Planchera. And lastly, thank you council members. Good to see you again. Thank you for coming out. Good job. Robert Ponichera, Javier Aguilar and Kareem Niles. Council Chairman Ivey, vice Chairman Harrison.

My name is Bob Panachtara, I'm the executive director of Liberty's promise. I'd like to thank all the past and current council members for their support of our work. Thanks to your grants, Liberty's promise has served nearly 1500 youth in four high schools in the county, Cladensburg, High Point, northwestern and Parkdale. More than 99% of our program participants have graduated from high school. As a matter of fact, only nine of our youth in 14 years have not finished high school and we're trying to rope them back in. So it's a testimony to the young people that they stay in the program and that they stay in high school, and they go on to do some great things. I'm speaking to you this evening to ask your support for our request of Liberty's promise to receive a non departmental grant of $130,000 for fiscal year 2025. Your support would continue, allow us to continue our programming at these four schools. In a moment. Now, Angela just threw me for a loop, because I always say that you're about to hear from our youth, and they're going to tell you about what they're doing. But you already heard from one. You're about to hear from three more. And let me tell you that they're all great kids and they're resilient. They're hardworking. They face some obstacles. Sometimes. Sometimes they have language barriers. A lot of times, they have additional duties that they need to do at home. Sometimes they need to work. Frequently, they need to work to support their families. They act as translators for their parents. They have to go home and cook dinner or take care of their younger siblings after they get home, before they can do their schoolwork. But just the same, they're resilient, they're hardworking, and they want to succeed, and they want to contribute to the county as a whole. Among our Prince George's alumni are attorneys, engineers, nonprofit workers, nurses, police officers, teachers, and members of our armed forces. Many of them have done some really impressive things. I would ask you then to consider our request in its entirety. It's a great investment for the county. Long after this fiscal year, the youth of our programs will be making a positive contribution to the civic life of Prince George's county. And so that future in mind, that we request your full support. Thank you very much for your attention and consideration. Thank you. Javier Aguilar, then Kareem Niles. All right. My name is Javier Alonso. Can you speak up? Speak louder. Okay. Okay. I am from. Okay, I'm calm. I came from Northwestern High School. My name is Javier Alonso. Can you pull the mic a little bit closer? Okay. I came from Northwestern High School, and this is my first year in this country. My name is Javier Alan Sagittarius Lopez. I am from Guatemala, and I am thankful for Liberty's prominence have helped me with some things that I need in my. My life. So, like, it's my first year in this country, so it's a little difficult to understand many things, the rules that we have to follow in this country and the state. So I'm gonna talk about a little bit of the program and how they make the things and how that program has helped me at Leroy's promise I have learned many important lessons that have helped me to be a more informal individual. Examples in learning to balance my finance and discovering new pots colleagues college javad and thanks to Libra's promise and their ability to help us meet and connect with professionals such as AstraZeneca and Drissbank. Without Lever's promise I would never have been able to acquire the needed community service hours earned by helping my community with activities such as cleaning up Hyde park or doing volunteer work for children in Neil all while having put through education field trips like our upcoming trip to DC where we will visit the s 5 miles end and other places I have never been able to see before. Most important of all, I was able to obtain helping indian resources resources to assist me in my ongoing immigration case. I assist. I am fortunate enough to have my program officer to configure and look for advice. This program is my opinion, a good program where one can learn and gain a lot from. That's all. Thanks for your attention. Excellente Kareem Niles then Jasper famous hello. Good afternoon judges. My name is Kareem Niles. I'm from highborn High School and I'm a part of Liberty's promise. So to me Libertys promise is my third place. For those who dont know, the third place is based off of a book written in 1989 by Ray Goldenberg. In order for a place to be a third place, it needs to be away from work or school or anything related to life, something relative and something that brings you joy and has a play for. Some of my first memories at Liberty's promise was when Miss Ella, Miss Emily, that is no sadly no longer, no longer with the program. She donated some stuff to my other club that I was a part of at the time and because of that I was like oh I want to go check out this club. So when I went the following week, some things we did a program where we created a college that we would want to go to and in my group we created the all american college which was. It was a pretty fun activity, getting kids from different backgrounds and different groups together to see how you can make a college that would be perfect for everyone in a, in a good way.

He took us on a field trip to a cosmetology school, which the cosmetology. I never really knew what it was about, but I've always wanted to be a barber. And seeing that barber is a part of cosmetology and how I can get into that field, what are some of the things that the school can do for me? And it basically educated me and gave me firsthand experience on what I can do to get into that field and how I can get into that field. Thank you. Thank you. Jasper famous Omar Neo good evening Council members. My name is Jasper Famous and I'm a student at Blainesburg High School and a proud member of liberty promise that I stand before you to shed light on an issue that has plagued our society, the differences in college enrollment rates between higher income families and lower income families. This problem, often referred to as the opportunity gap, is not just statistical inconsistency. It's a reflection of societal injustices that hinder the dreams and aspirations of countless young individuals in our world. Access to education should be a fundamental right, not a privilege reserved for those for the few who can afford it. Yet the reality is starkly different. Statistics consistently show that students from higher income families are more likely to enroll in colleges compared to the counterparts of lower income families. Why does this gap still exist? The answer lies in the unequal opportunities that exist between the two communities. For many lower income families, the path to higher education is plagued with obstacles, financial constraints, inadequate resources, and limited access to academic support. These all contribute to a lack in college attendance. As a result, many talented individuals are left behind, their potential wasted by circumstances beyond their control. Despite all this negativity, there is a positive programs like Libertys promise. Libertys promise strives to bridge the gap, to bridge the opportunity gap by providing support, mentorship, and resources to students from underserved communities. Through programs like this, individuals are empowered to pursue their dreams regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds. I speak from personal experience when I say that liberty promise has the power to transform lives. Thanks to the invaluable support network, I've had the privilege of meeting people whom I never would have dreamed of meeting. Some examples are a college admissions officer, Sarah Yasino from Trinity University. I was able to see peer into the mind of college admissions officer and look at what they look at when they read a college application. These interactions not only open doors for me, but have also shattered preconceived notions about what was possible however, Liberty's promise is just one piece of a puzzle. To truly address the opportunity gap, we must collectively commit to breaking the barriers that hinder access to education. Thank you, council members. Thank you. Next, Omar Neo, Felix, Berto Lazzaro and Michelle Clark. I am so proud. That was amazing, Jasper. I don't think I can top that, but I'll try. Honorable chair firstly, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Omar Kh Neo and I am the program officer of Liberty's promise in Prince George's county. I'm a committed grassroots advocate. This is my passion and I believe this is my calling. I have had the honor of working in Prince George's county for a year now, and it's clear and obvious to me that there is a gap between where we are and where we want to be. What will allow us to bridge that gap is our youths. The future Liberty's promise is a vital pillar that can permit our young citizens to achieve our aspirations and goals as a community. I am more than confident that Liberty's promise provides strong support for our youths, which is unmatched by any organization within Prince George's county. We do so under the supervision and expertise of our founder, Doctor Robert Ponishtera, and our passionate and goal driven program officers like myself and Juan. I have the pleasure I had the pleasure of meeting council members Honorable Eric Olson and your honorable Jolene Ivey in person, and I can see that your hearts are pure and that you have the interests and the interests of the communities as your number one priority. With that being said, I'm confident that you recognize and realize the constructive impact that Liberty's promise has on our youths and the positive externalities that come with the program. In order for Liberty's promise to continue to do such substantial and beneficial work within our community, funding is a critical factor. We rely on your fiscal support.

The honorable vice chair Sydney Harrison and the esteemed members of the county council. My name is Felix Lazaro, a special educator for 17 years here at Prince George's County Public schools, and I teach in a school that is known as a school with significant students with significant cognitive disabilities, the name of my school is C. Elizabeth Rigg at Mitchellville, Maryland. Now, who are our students, by the way, before I move on, I am also a member of the board of Prince George County Educators association and the MSEA board of directors. Now, who are our students? Our students have hearing impairment or visual impairment. They are nonverbal. They cannot clean themselves. We have to feed them, you know, breakfast and lunch, or sometimes they are tube fed or they have private duty nurses that attends to our students. They cannot communicate. They only communicate through touching or through voice output devices that are pre recorded, and they are wheelchair bound, meaning they are on wheelchairs and they are unable to read and write. So they just communicate through what we call the eye gaze or the communication devices. Now, as a classroom manager or classroom teacher, what do we do in the classroom? A classroom teacher must see to it that all requirements are followed or complied with to the letter. For example, policies, procedures, protocols, uploading of documents on merlin, online toileting entries in logbooks, the use of physical therapy equipment. These also have to be made online. And also the monthly and quarterly assessments on reading and math. The monthly Medicaid entries must be done by each case manager. And also the core vocabulary words must be able to assess with our students. Now, over the years, our student numbers have increased. In school year 21 22, there were 113 students last year. Last school year, there were more than 120 students. And this year we have 143 students. Next year, there will be 154 students. Why? So several regional centers or schools with, you know, this kind of student population have been closed. And not next year, but two years from now, Duckworth will be closed and Sea Elizabeth Rigg will remain as the only regional centers. What are they doing with, you know, students with significant cognitive disabilities? They are farming them out to existing regular schools without facilities for students with significant cognitive disabilities. We must have toilets in the classroom because, you know, our students cannot clean up themselves. So we have to have these toilets. Now, Dinan, we need a special ed coordinator who can act as, like, the orchestra coordinator. Okay. In order to help or assist our case managers. Just last week. Mister Lazaro, are you about done? You're over your three minutes. Okay, so I cannot, you know, explain in three minutes. No, you've already spoken for three minutes. Your time is up. Okay. So I invite you esteemed members of the county council to please visit us. Visit my school. The invitation is open. Okay. Thank you very much. No, thank you. I appreciate it. Michelle Clark. Mister Jonathan Della Cruz. She's not here. Okay. Jonathan dela Cruz and then Ryan Washington. Yes, of course. Do whatever you need to do. All right. Thank you, everyone. Ladies and gentlemen of the Prince George's county council, my name is Jonathan Della Cruz. I'm president of the thump yard nonprofit boxing gym located in Brentwood, Maryland. I'm here before you today with the message of hope, resilience and community empowerment. Today, I introduce you to a beacon of light in our midst, a nonprofit boxing gym nestled in Brentwood, Maryland, dedicated to serving not only the able bodied, but also those in our community who are often overlooked and marginalized. This is the thump yard. The story behind the thump yard is one of survival, determination, and a deep rooted commitment to making a difference. In 2000, I fell victim to senseless gun violence during a home invasion in Silver Spring, Maryland. This tragic event left me paralyzed from my chest down, forever altering the course of my life. But from the ashes of adversity emerged a powerful vision, a vision to unite our community, raise awareness on gun violence, and provide a safe haven where individuals of all backgrounds can find solace and strength through the sport of boxing. Myself, alongside my brother, Rioberto della Cruz, turned our pain into purpose and founded the thump yard.

Today, I introduce you to a beacon of light in our midst, a nonprofit boxing gym nestled in Brentwood, Maryland, dedicated to serving not only the able bodied, but also those in our community who are often overlooked and marginalized. This is the thump yard. The story behind the thump yard is one of survival, determination, and a deep rooted commitment to making a difference. In 2000, I fell victim to senseless gun violence during a home invasion in Silver Spring, Maryland. This tragic event left me paralyzed from my chest down, forever altering the course of my life. But from the ashes of adversity emerged a powerful vision, a vision to unite our community, raise awareness on gun violence, and provide a safe haven where individuals of all backgrounds can find solace and strength through the sport of boxing. Myself, alongside my brother, Rioberto della Cruz, turned our pain into purpose and founded the thump yard. Inspired by our father, Wilfredo dela Cruz, who introduced us to the sport at a young age, we embarked on our journey to create something truly transformative. From humble beginnings, hosting events in Adelphi, Maryland, the thump Yard has risen to become the leader in amateur boxing events in DC, Maryland, Virginia, impacting over 800 participants throughout the years. In 2023, we took a significant step forward by becoming a recognized nonprofit organization and opening our doors as a boxing gym to serve the community. TTY boxing and fitness we are more than just a gym. We are family, a support system and a catalyst for positive change. We believe in the power of boxing to instill disciplined confidence and hard work in all of our members, regardless of age or ability. Right now, TTY boxing and fitness is home to approximately 60 members, but our mission extends beyond the confines of the ring. We recognize that mental health issues and trauma affect individuals of all ages and backgrounds, which is why we offer programs tailored to address these challenges. From youth empowerment initiatives to senior fitness programs, from academic support services to community outreach efforts, the thump yard is committed to building champions both inside and outside the ring. Our favorite quote encapsulates our philosophy perfectly. Not everything in life is about boxing, but everything in boxing is about life. Through the sport of boxing, we aim to cultivate values that will resonate with our youth long after they leave our gym. We believe that the future lies in our youth and it is our responsibility to equip them with tools they need to succeed. But we cannot do it alone. We need the support of our community, our local leaders and members to ensure that our program continues to thrive and expand. With your assistance, we hope to secure resources that will enable us to reach even more individuals in need and be a beacon of hope for the most underserved populations in PG county. In conclusion, I urge you to join us in our mission to make a difference, one punch at a time. Together, we can build a stronger, more resilient community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Thank you for your time and consideration. Thank you sir, for your testimony and your testifying this evening. Next we have Ryan Washington. Thank you Mister Washington for joining us. Thank you champ. Excuse me, sorry, it's not holding up, but good evening, can you all hear me? Good evening everyone. My name is Ryan Washington with the apartment Office Building association for Metropolitan Washington. Just for the record, AOBA is a nonprofit association representing owners and managers of more than 133,000 apartment units and over 23 million office space in Prince George's and Montgomery county. Put a pause on the time. Thank you, thank you. I will be real brief with my time as you all had a long day and you already have my ring. Comments I just wanted to turn to the council as last October you all passed CB 66 2023. This legislation seeks to require security cameras and high occupancy apartment communities with 100 more units. This will greatly affect our garden style community. Apartments which are more spread out, which are more older, have been around the community for decades and don't have lacked the infrastructure to support a significant amount of cameras in the bill. It did require that the office management and budget provide a 5001 time rebate program for those communities that are open eligible one time program thanks to to work to a few council members, we were asked, we would like to respectfully ask the council to provide some sort of funding or initial funding in that program to help offset that cost for our members and property owners throughout the county. And with coming with security cameras is a significant investment, not only just in the camera alone, but the installation, the general maintenance which will require a significant amount of investment in communities, deferred costs to other projects, especially since the law will take effect next month as other communities are required to go into compliance. We ask this body to provide some sort of funding, dedicated funding source to this as our members are providers of this county. Thank you very much and have a great evening. Thank you Mister Washington for your testimony and testifying tonight. Next we have Nellie Ortiz. Nellie Ortiz. Alright, so we'll go to the next speaker. We have Miss Lorraine Holmes Settles.

Miss Lorraine Holmes Settles. Good evening, everyone, to the chair person and other members of the councils. Ladies and gentlemen, I am the chief development officer of the Arc, Prince George's county. We are your neighbors next door, literally, and I come before you, as we have from year to year, either Rob Malone, our chief executive officer, or myself to ask for your consideration to support some program that we think would be beneficial to the community. As you know, we serve people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, about 600, in fact, with group homes. We serve transitioning youth coming out of high school at age 21, transitioning to adulthood, and other kinds of services. We run a daycare center, and we also work with infants and toddlers so that young parents can begin to make that difficult transition to care for their young children. We also serve people through end of life. We were started back in the fifties. Many of the children who were infants then are seniors now. So now we're also looking at extended services. One of the things that happened during COVID is that a number of people who had hoped to be able to work and that were in our training program were not able to work. And so we are now revitalizing our office training program, office skills training program, which allows us to provide a very intense opportunity for young people, or anyone, for that matter, that comes into our program to learn a variety of office skills. We've had people go work for places like Thompson Creek windows that help people put together those packages that the repair people take out with them, and they show you all the wonderful displays they have. We have people who are working in the FCC doing mail room kinds of things because they're very good at repetitive kinds of behaviors related to the Alphabet or the numbering of offices, and they know how to go from one to the other and very methodically deliver mail. We recently hired David, who now works in our office next door, as our receptionist, after having replaced someone who had been retired after 25 years. And he has adeptly learned the skills to operate spreadsheets and Microsoft office and those kinds of things. We are now serving about 100 people who are working in places like Wegmans and giant and other kinds of retail operations. But there are more jobs that people with disabilities, who certainly have mobility issues in many instances, could very well do if they were able to sit at a desk and perform some of the tasks that we teach them, from customer service to organizing files, maintaining databases, bookkeeping, faxing, you name it, we can help them do it. We would like to ask for your consideration and when we come back to you and request funding to serve at least 40 to 50 people as we go into the new year to resuscitate this program. Thank you for your past support and we hope to look forward to your support in the future. Thank you. Thank you. Mister Rigoberto de la Cruz and Andy Sigmund and mister James Deldado. Hello. Good evening. Good evening. Prince George's county council members. My name is Rigo Berno della Cruz. I am co founder vice president of the Thump yard. We started the thump yard in 2021 as we seen the need for the youth in the community coming out of social isolation. So again, I'm gonna go back. So again, we started the dumpyard in 2021 as we've seen the need for the youth and community in the community coming out of social isolation. We will host a backyard boxing event every other Sunday because we saw and heard so many testimonies and changes in the people in the community where we couldn't stop this, push us to keep taking the thump yard to the next level, to keep serving the community and striving to the next bar. We are we now host three to four boxing boxing amateur events here in Prince, Georgia county in District two. Last year we were grateful to host and have 18 fighters come from Ireland to compete for the first time in district two. As a result, we received a proclamation citation. In 2023, the Thump yard opened tty boxing and fitness in Brentwood, Maryland to continue serving the youth, adults, seniors, and even the disabled community. With adaptive boxing, the thump yard has been able to impact and change lives over 800 participants since its incipation. Channel Nine News won an Emmy award on their coverage of our movement in 2021 from the backyard events in District two and also featured a thump yard in 2022 when we hosted our first boxing event in District two as well. Uni vicion also did coverage on the movement in 2021 and 2022. We have a documentary out on YouTube called the champion of circumstances as well we.

I want to thank you all for your thoughtful and considered approach to a PG county budget framework that works for all of us, particularly your focus on health, well being, and development of our residents, of our friends. As you know well, leveraging our government funding to help reach those most in need requires the people, the purpose, and the passion among our partners to make a difference. My friends at the thump yard are those people with that purpose, with that passion, they are uniquely qualified to bring together, young and old alike, for physical fitness, a sense of community, and a place where we all belong. As you heard from the people behind thumpyard themselves, Jonathan Enrigo, they're building an environment full of opportunities where we all come together, regardless of age or skill level. Whether you're four or 74, the thump yard is a place for you where there are coaches, tutors, and partners providing support, encouragement, and guidance. And their purpose could not be more important. To provide after school programs for at risk youth, reduce gun violence, and equip young and old alike with an active lifestyle, mental discipline, and, of course, a fun, welcoming atmosphere where friendships are built and our achievements are celebrated together. The thump yard brings their passion for not just boxing, but for uplifting the community in everything that they do. As a member of the gym myself, I know this because I see their commitment every single day. What organizations like the thump yard need, though, to extend their reach and truly leverage their positive impact in the community, is the continued support of the council as you work to finalize your budget decisions. I want to thank you again for the special attention you pay to organizations like the thump yard and appreciate your support. Thank you. Thank you, neighbor. Yes, go ahead, mister vice chair. We've had individuals speaking from the thump yard. We just wanted to know what is that? Monetary request from the thump yard. Thank you. I just want to make sure I didn't miss that. Okay, Mister James Delgado and Rick Mullikin and Cipriano king, junior. Good evening, council members. My name is James Delgado. I do the tutoring at the front yard. I had to learn the quadratic formula the hard way. YouTube. I stand before you today to advocate for the allocation of grants to our beloved family oriented boxing club. Our club is not merely a place where clubs where boxing gloves meet punching bags. It is the cornerstone of our community, a beacon of support and a sanctuary for individuals of all ages and backgrounds. At our club, we offer more than just boxing exercise we provided. Our programs extend far beyond the ring, encompassing essential services that enrich the lives of those we serve for our esteemed seniors, we offer tailored boxing exercises that promote physical health, mental acuity and social connection. Our sessions provide them with not just a workout, but a sense of camaraderie and purpose. We offer after school homework tutoring for our youth, ensuring that academic support is readily available to those who need it most. We believe education is the key to unlocking potential and are committed to empowering our youth to succeed academically. Furthermore, we recognize the critical importance of mental health support, especially for young members facing the challenges of adolescents. Through our youth mental health counseling service, we provide a safe space for them to express themselves, seek guidance and develop coping strategies to navigate life complexity. By investing in our club, you are investing in the heart of our community. You are supporting programs to promote physical fitness and foster academic success, mental well being and social cohesion. Our club serves as a lifeline for many, offering hope, encouragement and opportunities for growth. Therefore, I urge you to consider the invaluable impact that our club has on the fabric of our community and to allocate grants that will enable us to continue our vital work. Let us ensure that our community, our club, remains a beacon of light, empowerment and resilience for future generations. Thank you for your time and understand the quadratic form. You're ahead of me. Rick Mullachen. Cipriano King, junior good evening, everyone. I stand before you as an example of what is possible at the thump yard. At 70 years of age, I'm the thump yards oldest boxer. I started two years ago at 215 pounds. My walking around weight is 167. I fight at 165. My debut fight was at a national masters tournament at the show boat hotel in Atlantic City last fall. It was a wild ride, I can tell you. It is a humbling experience. And I suppose that what I meant to say was the thing that surprised me most about boxing was the deep and abiding respect between fighters, their coaches and their mentors and their families. The respect accorded me is humbling. I didn't expect it, and someone said it very well just a short while ago. He's an elegant elder boxer who brings his fighters to our gym to spar. He said to me, boxing changes everything. And he was right.

Also I am the head strength and conditioning coach, and I also consider myself a counselor and something that I think that we all play a big role in. One thing I do love about the thump yard, and this is something I always say about fitness, being someone in this country who is considered a minority, although I don't consider anything about me or my people, you know, especially our history, anything minor about it. But it seems like, as a man in this world that we live in, you know, it gets to a certain point where you get to a certain age where you seem to be the most misunderstood person in this planet. And one thing I love about fitness, and especially at the thump yard, it's a place where everybody can be vulnerable and not be judged for it. And that's what I love about fitness most especially what I bring to the table, is that I see myself more than a coach, because how people approach me with their problems and whatever predicaments they're going through in life, they feel okay to be vulnerable with us at the thump yard. And that's the beauty of it. We see the changes, we see the impact. And I honestly do believe that we're not only saving people's health, we're saving people's lives. Coming, you know, from an urban community, you know, we can relate to these kids because, you know, they're at that age where, you know, I remember losing more than half of my friends during summer. We didn't have a safe haven, you know, and this place is a safe haven for the youth to avoid drug dealing, to avoid hood banging and gang banging. Yeah, there are kids who probably are into that lifestyle, but it's not my job to judge. My job is to play my role as your coach. And my job is to love you and guide you. And that's one thing that the thump yard has done. The thump yard will continue to do. All we ask is for your support. We thank you for the time that you had given us. At this very moment. We thank you for your consideration. But like boxing, how we use our hands to defend ourselves. You see how my hands, my fingers are separated at the moment. You can probably break every single one of my fingers right now because they're vulnerable, because they're separated. But when you put them all together, they turn into a weapon. But the difference between this weapon, it doesn't kill, it saves. And that's what we do at the thump yard. God bless you all, and thank you for your time. Thank you, Amy Pargoski. And then Arnetta Jefferson Rogers. Good evening, council members. It's good to see you again. My name is Amy progoski. I'm a district one homeowner and a volunteer for 18 years at the county animal shelter. In my professional life, I'm an engineer with over 30 years experience in the aerospace industry. As a self proclaimed geek, I fully rely on data and facts to assess that what we're building is a functional design that will achieve mission success. Applying that same logic to the county's 27 year old breed specific legislation, I can say with certainty that it's a failure and a waste of money. There are more dogs labeled as pit bulls in the shelter than any other breed, which means the law is just not working. Yesterday, there were 167 dogs listed on the website, 71 of which were labeled as an illegal breed. There's not enough staffing to properly care for and exercise all the dogs, so allowing these pit bulls to be adopted to our county residents would reduce the number of dogs there and the need for additional staffing. Also, adopting the dogs out would mean revenue would be coming in in terms of adoption and license fees instead of having to pay for additional euthanasia, drugs and cremation. With the breed ban lawsuit over and the enforcement possibly set to resume, we don't expect authorities to go door to door to collect dogs that you deem illegal. But the problem is now the dogs that are picked up as strays now cannot go back home to the county residents. This will only make the euthanasia numbers skyrocket and you can't rely on rescue groups to fix this problem. The breed labels are very arbitrary and just based on appearance. And as you know, behavior is not tied to appearance. That's true for humans and canines. As I testified on March 26, the county is not enforcing the spay neuter law that already exists. Too many dogs leave the shelter unaltered as adoptions are returned to owner, which is just adding to the overpopulation crisis because many of them will be bred intentionally or accidentally. Pit bulls are not a primary public safety concern, per the public safety listening tours hosted by council members Fisher and Hawkins in March. At the March 14 session, I brought up the concern of just stray dogs in general as ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Thump Yard", "insights": [{"observation": "The Thump Yard provides a safe haven for youth to avoid drug dealing and gang banging.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The Thump Yard allows people, especially those considered minorities, to be vulnerable without judgment.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The Thump Yard helps in saving people's health and possibly their lives.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "County Animal Shelter", "insights": [{"observation": "The breed-specific legislation has led to an overpopulation of certain breeds in the animal shelter, particularly pit bulls.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Adopting pit bulls out to the county residents would reduce the number of dogs in the shelter and the need for additional staffing.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Current legislation failure results in increased euthanasia, requiring more euthanasia drugs and increased cremation.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The breed-specific legislation has been identified as a waste of money.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Thump Yard", "insights": [{"observation": "The Thump Yard provides a safe haven for youth to avoid drug dealing and gang banging.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The Thump Yard allows people, especially those considered minorities, to be vulnerable without judgment.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The Thump Yard helps in saving people's health and possibly their lives.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "County Animal Shelter", "insights": [{"observation": "The breed-specific legislation has led to an overpopulation of certain breeds in the animal shelter, particularly pit bulls.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Adopting pit bulls out to the county residents would reduce the number of dogs in the shelter and the need for additional staffing.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Current legislation failure results in increased euthanasia, requiring more euthanasia drugs and increased cremation.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The breed-specific legislation has been identified as a waste of money.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 4880824, "chunk_end_time": 5280772, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3548?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3548?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=4880"}, {"start": 74000, "end": 80000, "text": "ssibly set to resume, we don't expect authorities to go door to door to collect dogs that you deem illegal.

Pit bulls are not a primary public safety concern, per the public safety listening tours hosted by council members Fisher and Hawkins in March. At the March 14 session, I brought up the concern of just stray dogs in general as a safety concern. It wasn't even selected as one of the biggest concerns. To further breakdown and review, nobody at the session mentioned pit bulls as a safety concern. If you want to keep the residents safe, look at each dog's individual behavior, because aggression can come in all breeds, ages, sizes and both genders. I'm a dog lover, but I don't want any dangerous stray dog in my neighborhood threatening me, my family or my dogs. Sadly, the ban essentially devalues the dogs, so people who want to harm dogs know they're easy to exploit and mistreat since the county officials really don't care about them. By keeping the ban in place, Prince George's county now has the dubious distinction as the largest jurisdiction in the country with a pit bull ban. That's really nothing to be proud of. In the past few years, thanks to social media, support for these dogs has grown tremendously. My personal Instagram account, PG pities, now has over 5000 followers who support these dogs and our fight to save them. People are really invested in their well being. We will continue to defend the good dogs and advocate for you to spend our taxpayer dollars more wisely. Thank you. Thank you. And while Arnetta Jefferson Rogers comes up, Miss Piergotski, you can wave at the screen at your council member up there, Tom Brunoga. Good evening, city council. Thank you so much for having me. I do apologize for my tardiness, and thank you again for accepting you were just on time. Thank you. Thank you so much. I am Arnetta Jefferson Rogers. I am the business development manager for Athletes Global Corporation. We are a vendor with the state of Maryland and have over 30 states under us. I manage six of them. Maryland is particularly important to me because I live here. I am a Prince George's county resident and my mission first, is to help change the world one day at a time through transformational and informational innovative services. Athletes Global we have over 150 programs, steam education, academics, fitness and sports. And what I've noticed as the business development manager in Maryland is that the influx of the latina community has grown in our state schools, as much as 70% to 90% around the Beltway. And as we welcome them, we would like to ask the council to consider funds allocating funds to bridge the gap between the black and latina communities by providing programs centered around cultural understanding so that the students are not segregated or feeling segregated in an integrated setting and with the hope of building community outside of the school. When they see each other at the grocery store, will they feel comfortable speaking when they're with their parents? Will they know how to speak each other's language outside of school, or even in school for that matter? So we're asking that you allocate funds aside so that we can have a cultural understanding of the two, and not potentially a race war, if you will, but the coming together of these two communities so that we can understand and love one another and it's already happening with some of the school coordinators who are, I take for example, Sonia Sotomayor is a brand new school. They are 90% latina, and they have taken the responsibility of building the community by getting some of our programs for the parents of their group. So I ask you to consider allocating funds for that and also chauncy in our schools because after the pandemic, the students didn't come back and we need to get them back in schools. So thank you so much for your time and thank you for having me. Athletes Global Corporation thank you very much. Yes, ma'am. Now I will turn to Leroy Maddox, who has a listing of potential CIP projects he must read into the record. Thank you, chair Ivey good evening, vice chair Harrison.

We have one more person who somehow got left off my list. Joseph Chiquita. You're our last speaker, Mister Chiquita. Thank you chair Ivey, vice chair Harrison and the Prince George's County Council for this opportunity to speak on the FY 25, Prince George's county operating and capital budget. My name is Joseph Chukuta and I am the acting chair for the Prince George's County Sierra Club. The Sierra Club is the largest and most influential grassroots environmental organization with millions of members and supporters, including thousands right here in Prince George's county. We are providing these comments on the proposed operating and capital budgets for FY 25. While we understand that this is a challenging budget cycle, climate action, protection of our streams and wildlands and maintaining a healthful environment for pinch Georgians cannot be considered optional. Healthy people need a healthy environment to safeguard the health and well being of pinch Georgians. We urge you to align the operational capital improvements budgets with our county's environmental values and with the Climate Action Plan adopted by this council in 2022. One of the great concerns is that climate change is not found in the policy focus areas. Climate change is a great threat to our future and local governments provide crucial avenue to addressing the crisis through making wise land use decisions and transportation decisions that are more sustainable, assisting residents with access to financial resources to electrify their lives, and ensuring the permitting process do not impede progress.

action, protection of our streams and wildlands and maintaining a healthful environment for pinch Georgians cannot be considered optional. Healthy people need a healthy environment to safeguard the health and well being of pinch Georgians. We urge you to align the operational capital improvements budgets with our county's environmental values and with the Climate Action Plan adopted by this council in 2022. One of the great concerns is that climate change is not found in the policy focus areas. Climate change is a great threat to our future and local governments provide crucial avenue to addressing the crisis through making wise land use decisions and transportation decisions that are more sustainable, assisting residents with access to financial resources to electrify their lives, and ensuring the permitting process do not impede progress. Making sure we are resilient to climate change the county council adopted this climate change action plan in 2022 and it should be well underway. However, the budget does not appear to reflect that this climate action plan was only mentioned once in the context of the department and the environment. However, the budget of all county agencies, especially Dpw and T and D PI, should reflect the change in direction and new priorities that are necessary because of climate change. The budget needs to be amended to show that the climate action plan is a priority. Though we are supportive of such initiatives such as resource recovery, vision zero, community engagement, enhanced bus service, beautification, restoring the health of county waters and flood management. These are part of the solution, but they only nibble around the edges. One very important position that needs to be created is in the county executive office. Given governmental structures, it's not necessary to provide funding for a full time climate officer in the county executive's office to coordinate mitigation across all agencies. This position cannot reside in DoE and must be in the county executive's office so that the person in this position can work cross agency. We are also greatly concerned about the budget cuts found in DoE. While there's a 2.7% budget cut for FY from FY 24 projected actuals, it doesn't seem so bad. When you looked at the office of the director, there's a draconian budget cut of nearly 50%. While even more responsibility for climate action and implementation is required, we need this budget cut to be reversed. It's also disconcerting to see how the way, how little in the way of local funding goes to bettering our environment. This has created a department that's highly dependent upon the whims of grants, and we need to make sure that policy policy actions are found in local funding. Thank you. Thank you.

Virtual hearings are recorded and transcribed during the meeting. Please state your name for the record each time you speak. For clarity and transcription. Please do not speak over another person. If you wish to speak, please raise your hand and you will be called upon in turn. Our criteria for granting appeals involving variances pursuant to council Bill CB 16 2021, section 27 230 of the zoning ordinance authorizes the board to grant variances when a specific parcel of land has exception. Physically is physically unique and unusual in a manner different from the nature of surrounding properties with respect to exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape, exceptional topographic conditions, or other extraordinary conditions peculiar to the specific parcel, such as historical significance or environmentally sensitive features. The particular uniqueness and peculiarity of a specific property causes a zoning provision to impact disproportionately upon the property such that the strict application of the provision will result in peculiar and unusual practical difficulties to the owner of the property. Such variance is the minimum reasonably necessary to overcome the exceptional physical conditions. Such variances can be granted without substantial impairment to the intent, purpose, and integrity of the general plan or any area master plan, sector plan, or transit district development plan affecting the subject property, and the variance will not substantially impair the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a variance may not be granted if the practical difficulty is self inflicted by the owner of the property. All of these criteria must apply. If the board determines that it needs to seek technical assistance from any other governmental agency, we shall do so. The approval of a variance is not a guarantee that further review will not be necessary by any other governmental authorities. Following the approval of a variance, a building permit must be obtained. Before any building permit will be processed by the county permits office, a copy of the board's written order must be presented. Approval of any variance is contingent upon development of the property in compliance with the board's approved site and elevation plan.

Can we see some photos of the driveway, please? Madam chair, can I interrupt first a moment, please? Regarding the retaining wall. I did not intend for that to go on the hearing notice, because from the way it looks and the elevation plan that was submitted, that retaining wall is not over 4ft. Okay, so that needs to come off. I believe so. Mister George is count. Inspector Harrison. Yes, Mister Harrison. I want to remind everyone we have an interpreter, so just give her a chance to interpret. Okay? I apologize. Okay.

Mister Casa, did you put the sidewalk on the side? I didn't need any construction in these three years. I did it. Pardon? So he has done nothing to the property since he's been there in 21? I didn't.

Miss Olga, do we have a copy of a violation or correction, corrective order, or. I think I saw one. No, not in the binder. Okay, anything else we need to put on the records? Mister Harrison, what were your complaints that you got? What was it in referencing press, Georgia County Inspector Harrison. The complaint was with the extended driveway and retaining wall. And Mister Harrison, were they complaining that it was being constructed or do you have a clue as to why the complaint was Georgia's county inspector Harrison? They didn't indicate. They just said that the driveway was extended and that they had a retaining wall without a permit. Just for the record, this has been there. He's saying since he's testified that it's been there since 2021 and prior. And this is the first time we've had a complaint. Also, madam chair or Miss Olga, could you go back to some of the photographs, maybe from pictometry, if you have them. That shows the date of the photograph, if it was there prior to the purchase of the home. Now, this photo doesn't show that wall. What was this date? A photo. Gumballo. Mila, photo can machine. Okay. This photo that is on the screen now was dated December 21, so it is obviously there. December. Higher. Handy Tennessee gumball. This is. If you scroll down to.

Of the Google photos of the Ariels. Sorry, yes, the Ariels. Photon West Georgia's county inspector Harrison. As you can see, the old photos, the wall was built with eight inch, I'm sorry, four inch bricks, which it looked like it was not over 4ft tall. I mean, over 4ft tall. And if you look at the new photos, they use the eight inch stone bricks, and they're with the three layers, it's 24 inches, and there's more than three layer bricks. There therefore is over 4ft. I mean, 2ft in height. And yet the measure from the bottom of this foundation to the top. But mister. Sorry. Sorry, Madam Inspector. Interpreter. But I'm not sure who to direct this to. But for purposes of the variance, they don't need a variance for the retainer wall, just a permit. Correct? Or they need a variance for that as well, mister harris? No, they only need the permit. So today we're basically talking about the driveway only? That is correct, madam chair. And just for clarification, this is boybet Reisler. It looks like from this google photo f that the driveway apron was not extended. It just the concrete was built to, I guess, make it parallel with the existing apron. Okay. Miss olga, could you put up the aerial f, please? I'm sorry, say that again. Area f. This is a photo f. No, we need the area. Miss ogre. I believe it's page 20. Got it. One moment, please. Okay. Fuck. A kayan light and a sound photon. Is that okay? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Anything else we need to put on the record? Mister cassad, this is board member eisler. Mister cassar, is there a need for the extended driveway? No, I don't need any extension. I think we need to make that clear, what we're saying. Do you need the driveway? No, I don't need any extension. I just want it the way it is. Oh, okay. Okay. Any other questions? Not for board member Iceland. No questions. Board member Alston. Mister Harrison, anything else you'd like to put on the record, mister? Inspector Harrison? No. I'd like to make a motion that we take this under advisement. Second board member Iceland.

We'll let you know that at the same time, madam chair, we could advise him we're not going to be looking at the retaining wall. We are only reviewing the driveway in front of the house. Mister Harrison said if it's over 2ft he has to get a permit, right? That's correct. So he may want to look into that press George's count. Inspector Harrison? Yes. Because you know, a lot of time they take you all consideration of what you're telling them and then forget about the other issues that y'all are not talking about. But that's not addressed here.

It's not even 3ft over 2ft. He has to get a permit and that's something he has to pursue. Is that correct, Mister Harris?

To validate an existing condition, the lot width at the building line and obtain a building permit for the proposed concrete driveway and a six foot wooden fence at 5450 Addison Road in Fairmont Heights.

Tell us what you're proposing to do on the property. I need you please speak in shorter sentences. That way I can interpret. Well, I need to extend my driveway because I don't have enough space for the vehicles. Also, I don't have a shoulder on my street, so I have to park in the street, and then sometimes my tires are punctured. Is that an issue? Just with you? Yes. A problem? Yes. I just purchased the house on June 12 of last year, and here in front of the house, there's not a place to park, so you got to park far away in front and normal. So my plan is because I don't want to, like, bother any of the neighbors in front of me, so I want to extend the normal driveway and make it wider. So. So how many cars do you have? Automobiles do you have? I have four vehicles. And you can't park on the street. No, not shoulder. Escaya principal. No, we don't have shoulders. It's. It's a main street.

They have a driveway, but their house is different because their driveway is on the side of the house, and it goes all the way to the back in the yard. I'm sorry, Miss Olga, could you put on the site plan, please? There we go. Can we make it a little bit bigger? No satellite prohibito. Yes. Yes. That's what. That's what I want to do. And I'm not going to touch the apron. I know that it's. I work for the county so I know that's prohibited. I just want to do my extension and that's it. So you're trying to go to the rear end of your house or where the cotton. You want to go back where the concrete patio is? Exactly, yes. How long have you been living there? June 12 of 23. Did you have four cars when you purchased the property? See la casa. Shoulder? Shoulder. Yes, I did. But before I moved in I rented a house and it did have a shoulder, but I've had him since I bought the house. I was planning on putting gravel but they told me that was prohibited as well. And you want to put a four foot fence. In the front yard is the tier poner patio de lantero primeros. The six ps, the French. La casa atras. Either la casa palfrey quatro. Yes, if God permitted. And if you guys allow me, after you. If you approve this, I'm going to build a fence of 6ft from the front to the back and 4ft from the back to the front. I'm having a little problem with that because on the site plan where it says proposed wooden fence, there's a four foot fence that goes from the of the property to a stop line and then another arrow just a little bit in front of the house where it says 6ft to the back. Desta la linha de paro. No, no casa, no staunada, no defense. No, there's a problem. When I purchased the house, there's no fence. There is nothing. Nothing. Yes, but on the site plan. Miss Olga, can you go to the bottom right of the site plan and place your cursor at the very bottom of the four foot fence. Place your cursor right. You see where it says 30ft and it has the bottom arrow? Okay. Then you have two arrows that come together with a line in the middle. Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Run up that first arrow to that cross line, see? Okay. Sigasia riva esa primera Fletcher asia la linea de tondas crusade. Nope. I'll go to see the 30ft. See that line where it says 35?

At that point in a sepun, does it change to a six foot feet fence? Yes. Where the arrows meet? Yes. Circle de la de la mera and friendos paradox. I'm sorry, may the interpreter clarify? I'm not understanding what he's saying. So supposedly I was going to put the six foot fence from the front to the back, see? Little French de la casa pala. Apron. And from the front of the house to apron I'm going to put quadruple 4ft. 4ft. Okay, thank you. Okay. The four foot fence runs from the street to about the corner of the house and then 6ft from there back to the. To the back. Exacto. See? Exactly. Yes. Thank you. Does it show how wide the driveway is right there in front of the house? Okay. Chair. The measure. The existing driveway looks to be 20ft wide by 32ft long. Go in front of the house. I'm sorry, in front of the house the extension is an additional 9ft wide. Then once it gets up to the house it looks like it expands approximately 25ft wide by 34ft in length or quadratic. So that additional 34ft will taken back to the concrete patio. Yes. This is Boy McGregor, Miss Stone. The four foot fence in the front yard though is. There's a variance. Isn't needed for that is it? That's correct. Okay. So the defense is not really something we're considering today. I'm sorry, mister Gomez. Yes, that is correct. Yes, correct. So it's just the driveway. Okay. Via the accessories. I did notice that the hearing notice does ask for a security exemption. Yes it does. Don't know that that is required. Although there is an alley in the background and I do not, I am not 100% sure that the fence has to set back from the out. That's something I have to look into. Okay. I just noticed something with the driveway in front of the house. I'm sorry. Can you interpret your request repetition the notice of hearing the note that did a request for a variant for the driveway in front of the house. I believe what has happened is that instead of asking for the waiver of the driveway in front of the house, we asked for security exemption. So I believe that we need to re advertise this case to number one, ask for the waiver of the driveway location and remove the security exemption after I review or determine if the alley is considered a public right of way where we would need a security exemption.

No. Yeah. Donde Celale. I'm sorry but I already paid an engineer to come and measure my property and I know where my property ends and I know where the alley is so there's no need for that. Well actually the code may require that the six foot fence be set back a certain amount from the alley. So that's something I have to check into after Santayuno Street. Santayuno Avenue? Crocus. Because they never. That's behind me. He's got out 6ft all the way to 61st Avenue, I believe. Okay. But unfortunately, I can't look at his property. I can only look at yours. Okay. Per. Lamentable. Appropriate. Have you approached the town of Fairmont Heights with your proposal? Yes, we already did the variance with Fermion Heights and it was. I just needed to do it with you. That was it. That's all that's left. This is boy member Iceland. Madam chair, did you see the letter from Fairmont Heights? No, I didn't. I won't put it on the record, though. No, no. La Viperola. One of our concerns is the six foot wood stockade fencing on the alley side, 56.66ft long long, and the four foot section of fencing 30ft long. I think the four foot section of fencing should be 40 long instead of 30 long, and this six foot section of the fencing should be 46.66 long. I also think the quality of the fencing they are proposing is of low grade and since the town is in the process of improving the adjacent walk path, with a grant from Pepco, the area from the pocket park on K Street to Addison, with new impervious walk surface, led lighting and plants, I think the fencing material should be upgraded to reflect our vision for the practical particular area. And this is from James Pinckney. What is he? Code enforcement officer. Have you seen that letter? Yes. Have you taken a new proposal to them? Status? Well, I went to town hall to get a permit, but I always go with you first. But this time I went with them first, so they told me to come to you first. Well, they're asking you to do certain things. Yes, because they told me if you give me the permit for the driveway extension, I would have to go with them as well. Offense. Either driveway or both things. For the fence and for the driveway extension, I don't think. Did they mention the driveway? I just mentioned, I don't know, a driveway. Lavia de extension. No, I mentioned it to them, but I have to do it with you first. The fence is already done. Well, they're. They're proposing that you put a better quality fencing and they want to have the landscape area look better because of the upgrade grades. They're doing fair. Exactly. So that's why I want to lay down the cement first or the concrete and then the fence, because if you do it, put the fence first, then. And then you try to put the concrete of the cement, then it stains the fence. Well, we would like you to go back to Fairmont Heights with the proposal. And if you make the modifications that they're asking for before we move forward. No, Sierra. Well, they told me to come with you. And if you gave me the permit, they would then come and with me and they would explain to me how to put the offense. Mister Sotto Gomez. If you could let him know that as long as the town is not approving that plan, then. And they're requesting revisions. We cannot approve the variance until we are both on the same page. What changes? Okay, the town is asking. A possible four foot section of fencing should be 40ft long instead of 30. And the six foot section of fencing should be 46.66 long. So? So, since they're asking for a revision, you're gonna have to submit that revised plan to us before we can make a decision on it. Plano Revisado anosotros antes. They are also asking for upgrade of the quality of the fence that you're putting out. But what I'm interested in is the driveway. So what was the point of putting all the. I sent them the photos and put up the signs that they gave me. So what was the point of all that? One without the other. In order. In addition, we have, and it's our fault, we have incorrectly stated a variance for a security exemption for the fence instead of a variance for the driveway location in front of the house. So that must be corrected before we can do anything. I sent you everything. I don't know what happened. I sent everything. No, no, it was not you. No, we incorrectly requested an incorrect variance on your hearing notice. So in order that you have a legal request, we have to make those corrections and tons of petition legal. We don't. And how long is that gonna take? Well, we have to re advertise, so it's gonna be. And you have to post the signs for another 15 days. But we. Okay, so you know. Okay, this board member is. Yes. Since the driveway is already existing in the front, would they still need a waiver or variance for just extending that? Mister Isler, we have to validate the fact that the driveway is in front of the house. And what happened? That advertisement with the driveway in front of the house didn't go to Fairmont Heights.

We here as a follow up to an initial variance request for an extension of a driveway, current driveway of 8ft by 17ft, to extend our current driveway to allow for more car parking space. Okay, so, madam chair, we did hear this case on, let's see, it was. Hold on, 1 second. November 2023. It was continued for the HoA approval. We then heard it on, I believe, March. No, we just heard it on November and then today. That would be very quick, huh? Yeah. Okay. So you said you need more parking? Yes, we currently have car space. Our parking driveway is whatever length that it is. But we're. We just tried to get an additional parking on the side to allow for the vehicles to park without it being any. I don't know, in this area, I guess like it's overhang over the sidewalk and you get. I don't know, you get penalized when you car over the side or whatever. And so we were. We went through the DPI to just give the extension and then we work with the engineers to assure that our existing parkway was. Was fall within whatever parameters. And so we said that they said that we needed the actual variance to assure that it would come within whatever code or the approval. Was this a new build? Yes. The driveway, just a new extent in the home, though. So how long have you lived there? Since March. Of 2023? Well, since May of 2023. No, March. Yeah, March 2023. I'm sorry, but you just moved in.

It appears that there's a letter from the homeowners association that says that they had a hearing last night. Oh, they did? Okay. Can we pull that up, Miss Olga? Yes, the last page of the binder. But I think the attorney for the Homeless Homeowners association is here to give, I guess, the determination that was made last night. That's correct, yes. Okay, mister? Yeah? Mister Silverman, would you like to tell us what the results were? Yes, Madam chairman. The board of directors held a hearing with Mister and Misses Irby last night. There were two matters discussed at the hearing. The first was an unapproved replacement of the front door of their dwelling, which is not a matter for this board. The second was the matter of the driveway extension, which was commenced without prior approval in violation of the declaration. The board found that, in fact, there was a violation of the declaration by virtue of the driveway extension having been commenced prior to obtaining prior approval. The board further found that even if an application is made retroactively, the board cannot approve the driveway extension because as extended, it would locate vehicles too closely to the electrical box that exists between the urban property and the adjacent property. And the board is concerned that because there was a fire previously in the community, that the danger of a vehicle hitting the box was too great to permit vehicles to be parked at that location. And therefore, even if application were made for the driveway extension retroactively, the board would not be able to approve it as constructed or as to be constructed. So the driveway has already been constructed? I believe it's partially constructed. No, madam chair, there has to be an existing driveway there for the house to be there. So the extension. It's the extension we're talking about. Is the extension already there? The extension appears to be somewhat started, but they were stopped. And I believe that Inspector Swan had issued a notice of violation at that time. Okay, miss. Over. If you could pull up the exhibit as a picture of four b, I think that shows the start of the work in the proximity to the electrical box. Okay. May I say something? Yes, you can, Mister Irby. I. When I. In coordination with the engineers from DPIE, all of that was taken care of to assure that the new driveway would be in far clearance of that particular transformer that exists there. They are. They already, according to the drawings, they assured me that the drawings that they approve will give clearance of more than 5ft from this particular transformer on both sides, which it currently now is closer than 5ft from the current driveway. But they. The transformer to the current driveway. So if the matter is of like distance from the driveway, then the transformer to the current driveway is not even within. So. But the engineers at DPIE and I coordinated everything with the drawings in the, in the said plans to assure that hitting this transformer or whatever wouldn't be become an issue of that. And they pretty much approved that through their drawings that I with coordination with them for months, several months ago. So you have approval from d five? Yeah. Yes. They approve the drawings in the process to which be to be taken care of and then just referred us to the variance because of the size for which it would extend. Did you submit those plans to us? Yes, it's on there with the 17. With the 8ft by 17 foot drawings. And everything was submitted prior to this one. At the last member, this was stopped last time because Mister Silverman came in and started bringing up the things about the HOA wouldn't approve because of a door and things like that. And that was the reason that the last hearing was stopped. Not so much as because of the driveway station because we never got to the point of explaining that this was already pre approved by DPIE to do the existing driveway and everything like that with the engineers from that particular section. Covenants with your homeowners association. Do we have a. Say it again, ma'am. A covenants with your homeowners association. Madam Chair. I'm sorry, Miss Veronica. Go ahead. No, I was going to just further explain the covenants. We're not understanding, madam Chair. At the last hearing, I believe Miss Veronica said they never received the bylaws and there was mediation through the HOA, started the extension, but they stopped with a stop work order. They just moved in until May, blah, blah, blah. So Mister Swan, do you believe that the violations have been taken care of or are they still pending this? Chris George, County Inspector Swan, best of my knowledge, they've been addressed with. There's still some paperwork that needs to be taken care of. But could you explain what those violations were?

Chris George, County Inspector Swan, best of my knowledge, they've been addressed with. There's still some paperwork that needs to be taken care of. But could you explain what those violations were? It was for the driveway extension on the right side that we're speaking that we're here for, and a unpermitted deck and fence, both of which are currently permitted. Okay, so was the driveway part of that violation? Yes. Okay. And what was the violation for the driveway unpermitted extension? Okay, so they, they just didn't get a permit? Right? They didn't have permit. In their defense, I believe the extension was started by the previous owner. Because when I'm referencing the file, the violation was issued in March 8. Did eight days after transferring ownership. I'm sorry, 17 days after transfer of ownership. Okay, so they purchased this violation? Yes. Okay. So at this point, we still have a problem between. With the HOA not agreeing with the location of the extension. Is that correct, Mister Silverman? Yes, ma'am, that is correct. Mister Swan, was the site plan revised in some way to protect the transformer that we're not? I don't think we see anything in our site plan. It is allowing, as the respondent has stated, three to 5ft of clearance where the extension is supposed to stop from the transformer and this board. McGregor, mister and misses Irving, were those the plans that were reviewed or submitted to the HOA, the revised ones, protecting the transformer? Yes. Yes. Well, well, wait, hold on. The HOA never asked for any particular information in regards from us. The HOA just went with what? From my understanding, they just went with whatever the they're currently stoppage was for nobody access to see the additional drawings. And we spoke last night in terms of our understanding and in drawings with the engineer, which Mister, the HOA, I leave it as that. Never asked to see them next. Asked for them, never gave us this information that they now given today. It was, we was under the understanding that being that we had the approval from the engineers that we walked out of there with the understanding that we were good to go. Now we get here and saying that there was never going to the message that he just put out now. So I don't know. So may I. May I speak? Yes. Okay. So according when we first started this process back in November 1 time ever hearing from Mister Silverman. Now, as you can recall from our November meeting that we had here or our hearing with you guys, it was told that we would have a hearing or a, some type of mediation. We got notice of this mediation right as we had to post the sign for the appeal. So from the time we posted the sign for the appeal, all of a sudden Mister Silverman shows up now to discuss the mediation or the hearing we did have. Our first community meeting was. Yes, was last night. From the one time, from the one year that we've been here, we have never had a community meeting because there was no, never one call. So as our hearing, as of yesterday, we addressed. Since Mister Silverman brought it up, we addressed the door situation. We also had addressed this situation and we were waiting on the board to decide. We never received anything. We were supposed to receive a respondent last night, according to the board members didn't get that. Now we're here. This is our first time even seeing or hearing Mister Silverman respond in somewhat a manner of this box that now they're saying is an issue. So it seems like there seems to be every time we come here there's something different. You're saying you've never met with the HOA? No. This is our first meeting with the HOA was just last night. Last night was our very first meeting. Can I ask back in the November board of Appeals hearing Mister Silverman did attend and I have notes here that he requested a cease and desist need prior approval that it was basically gravel notice sent August 2323 received a response but not clear if he wanted, wanted a hearing with the HOA. And then Mister Irby stated that you never heard back from the HOA at that time. When I came and got my sign we had heard nothing from the HOA. We posted our sign on the 12th and then we get a response and an email on the 15th. Correct saying that now they're going to have be part of our, going to have our hearing. We had already received a letter about the HOA meeting. Then we received on the 15th stating that we're going to have a hearing about our situation the day before this current meeting right here. And so our first meeting with HOA was last night to which we had a meeting prior to the HOA meeting. And to my understanding when I explained about the engineers that everybody was in agreement that they understood that the engineer is that priorly approved us for the driveway extension. And now I'm hearing now according to the lawyer that I guess they went and said that they not going to approve because of the, I don't know. And may I add this? And I actually emailed Mister Silverman and the HOA board back in December. No response was given to me back in December stating that, you know, we said that, you know, there was going to be, we supposed to have a hearing. We haven't heard from you since, you know, November.

When will we have our hearing? Now we're in March and I got a letter from, well, email from Mister Silverman saying, oh, you're going to have your hearing on the 26th right before the community, the board, the HoA community meeting. So that's why it's kind of confusing and disheartening at the same time to see where we are today with this entire thing. Let me just say this. I can see if it was something we discussed yesterday and we kind of came into this knowingly, but we came into this today with his response from the HOA board after we've already discussed this and told them we had the engineer approved. This is where I'm getting confused. You all say you have an engineer approval. Where is it? Well, in our drawings, when we submitted for our actual permit, the approved drawings were submitted in a package here showing us the 8ft by 17ft extension in. The engineers from DPIE was the one who told us that that would be good to go in the DPIE plan. And the only thing we waited for was the variance of. Okay, then once we get the various approval, then we can go back and get the actual permit. That's correct. But we don't have a copy of that plan. No, it's in your permit package. It is not within your variance package. We don't have access to the permit package. And was that. Were those plans submitted to the HOA to overview? No, we didn't. We didn't have any community. We didn't have any. We didn't. We didn't submit this to the HOA because we had no communication with the HOA. We actually just talked about it last night. We just talked about this last night. Can I speak to a couple of these points? Yes, you can, Mister Silverman. Okay. First of all, mister and misses Irby purchased this property. It's in the homeowners association. And irrespective of whether they received the governing documents, which they should have received at the time, they signed a contract to buy their house. So if they didn't get it, it's not the HOA's fault. It's the fault of the person that they bought the house from. Nevertheless, the documents are a public record. The entire world is on notice that this property is subject to restrictive covenants. One of them being that they are required to submit an application for prior approval of architectural changes and exterior alterations. That obligation is theirs. It is not the association's obligation to request information from them. It is their obligation to submit for prior approval. Period. They have never done that. That was the reason for the initial violation last night. We never discussed any DPIE engineer plans at all. That was not discussed. What was discussed, and I made clear to the IRBs, and I know that the board is well aware of this, is that these two approvals, the HOA's approval and your approval for a variance are independent of one another. The HOA cannot tell this board to approve or not approve the irbariance. Likewise, the board cannot tell the HOA whether it can determine that they are in violation or not of the restrictive covenants. Those jurisdictions are separate. They may be informative of one another, but they are separate and apart. So I want to be clear that even if a variance is granted, and we have no right to tell this board to grant one or not grant one, it does not mean that the association cannot determine that the driveway extension is in violation of the covenants and decline to approve it. May I ask a question? Yes, you can, Miss Irving. Mister Silverman, when you say that it's not going to be approved, what grounds would it not be approved? Through the HOA. And I know this is not probably the arena for that, but I think everyone needs to hear the reason. Because if you explain to me, right, so if you explain to me that the reason that they're not going to approve it is because the board does not want to approve it, then that to me, I have another question, because my president, which sits two houses over here, has the same exact thing that we're requesting. So then I question, why wouldn't it be approved? As I said previously, as I said previously, the board will decline to approve the driveway extension because of its proximity to the electrical box between your property and the property next door due to its. Due to the board's safety concern, period. That is their determination. So, I'm sorry, the area Irby 68 20 as the crossing court. So is that what the initial violation was for or no, the initial violation was because you commenced the driveway extension without prior approval. However, what I am telling you is, even if approval is sought, it will not be granted because of the proximity to the electrical box. So it is not a violation that can be corrected by retroactive submission of an application. So, Hoa here supersedes County's engineering that authorizes a driveway. As I pointed out, Mister Irby, those two approval things operate on independent tracks.

So we can get on record here that the initial stop is violation wasn't because of a transformer box, it was because we didn't pre approve. Pre asked for application for the driveway, correct? That's correct. Okay, that is not so. The. So the concept of the transformer box came after the fact. Wait a minute. Well, the transformer box exists. I thought I heard you say that the trans. There was a fire previously, and you know, I just want to clarify what I heard. You said that there was a fire one time in a transformer box, and you all were concerned about the proximity of this transformer box to their proposed driveway. Is that correct? Yes, ma'am. Okay. I'm sorry to interrupt. We do have several gentlemen here Mister Silverman and Mister Irby, if you could please state your name before you speak. Yes, ma'am. Sorry, for the record, please. Thanks. But I'll say again, we have. We don't have anything approved by Deepak. Did d PI suggest any type of bollards around the transformer box? No, ma'am. Urea irby 68 28 acid crossing court. No ma'am. Because they already said that as long as we were. We started the driveway at a minimum of 5ft away from the front side of the driveway and go up to 17ft back. And one of the drawings that was submitted is in there showing the 8ft. By the 17ft drawing. It was. It was on the last one that we had. Oh, it wasn't in the bearing. Okay. I would suggest that you submit that plan to both the board of appeals and your Hoa. Yes, and unfortunately pretty much start from scratch. And if the HOA decides to rehear it with those revised plans, then we can go from there. And you may want to suggest putting some bollards around that box so that you won't hit it. But. So. Okay, so mind this area. Irby 68 28 acid Carson. So Mister Silverman, you said the fire happened at this transformer? No. My understanding. I apologize. Scott Silverman the. My understanding from my client is that they're. Was a fire in the association associated with the transformer, not necessarily this particular transformer in the past. That is what motivates the board's concern about proximity of parked vehicles and moving vehicles to that particular transport. So between the two. I'm sorry, this is Veronica Rackins, Irby. So basically, because where the box sits between two houses, there could be anything that can possibly hit that box is why they're denying it now. Correct? That's what I think that I already explained it, but basically it's the proximity of the driveway as extended or as proposed to be extended to the electrical box that poses the safety concern. Can I ask what this or whose box is that? Is that smeco is that type of utility box? Is this. I believe that it's both electrical and bio cable. No, no, I'm not 100% sure. I know that it is a utility box, but I'm not 100% sure what utilities control it. I'm just thinking, could the box be moved? That's very expensive. That may be very expensive area. Irby 68 28. I guess. I guess my confusion is the box is currently next to the driveway, a driveway and home in Biltwell. Back to this box. The existing driveway will be further away from the current driveway, which would be next to it. That Mister swans, if he said he saw it and he stood there, measured it with me, would be farther away from that. But the concern is that a further away extension will hit a box that's further away from a current existing driveway. That's what's confusing to me, I guess. This is the issue, I think, mister Irby, you have not presented what your plan is to the HOa. Perhaps you can go in and explain all of this to them. But you have not done that yet, correct? That's why I'm saying submit that DPI approved plan to your HOA, resubmit it with that plan, and, you know, if they prefer bollards around it, deep, I can revise your plan to include the bollards to protect the box. Okay. I guess because we were waiting for the actual mediation, which from form November, we was actually waiting for the mediation to do that, and then we didn't get that till last night. So. Because they say, well, mediation was to discuss that, or hearing was to discuss that. And that didn't happen to Nas nights, which I came with all my stuff at that meeting. And then I did discuss with everyone there about the approval by deep. Well, the understanding that DPI told us which way to have it. But I understand clearly now. And Mister Silver sat there and heard me and all. It was in agreement, and they asked a question afterwards. Oh, we didn't know that you had spoken with the engineers about that. Now, all of a sudden, this was not hurt, but I understand clearly. I got you. Yeah, send it to both of us. Okay, no problem. We'll do any other questions first. Georgia County Inspector Swan.

Is it different from the neighbors? Different from the neighbors? It is. I believe it is because of the location of the lot within the cul de sac. All of the lots within the cul de sac are different shapes and sizes. The fact that it being within the cul de sac, he does not have any street parking. Um, Miss Stone. Um, this is board member Iceland. Miss Stone, do we can. Since it seems like we're going to need to hear additional testimony from the IRB and the silverman's, should we just hold this open and then we can review the criteria? Absolutely.

Please always state your name before you speak. Okay. My name is Anthony Henderson. Thank you. Okay, so the proposal is to do the driveway retaining wall. And the driveway is going to be 35 by 10ft long. Now, we wanted. Do you see? I can't see anything. I can't, you know, so I'm, you know, so they're helping me, you know, talk to it. But. Do you all have any of the paperwork? Yes. Miss Olga, could you put your site plan up, please? What? You see where it's curved? Hold on, hold on 1 second. We don't have the site plan up yet, Miss Olga. Okay. All we're seeing is the file. Oh, okay. Okay. Hold on, please. Luciano Bahadi, screen. You said 35 by. What was it? Are you able to see now? Yes. Now this has 18 by 28. You see, I. I wish I had the plan in front because my other guy, person has all of the plan. He was supposed to be emailing it to me, but I. But I can't pull that up. Am I looking at the right one, Miss Stone? 83. So you need to look the correction because. No, this is 85. It's v 85. You have the correct site plan up and the proposed driveway is ten by 35. Okay. Okay. All right. Because I don't have all of that in front of me. We're looking at the depi approved site plan that says okay to construct a 35 by ten driveway. Okay. Now, I guess the variance was, do you see that little curve in it? Yes. You know, there's no way that we can have it straight. The reason why we had to do that, because the neighbors did their driveway without a permit and they came over into her space to where we couldn't have that three foot separation. And so now they said to have that three foot separation, we had to make out of the curve, you know, put, you know, put a little angle in it. And, you know, there's, down the street, both of the driveways are together and there's no. There's no curve in the middle of their driveway because they just put both of the concretes right together. I don't know if that was approved by the county, but that would be the way we would really want to do it. So she wouldn't have that, that curve in there because she comes in if you're looking at the, the plan. She, she's coming in on the right side, so she gotta go past and make that turn and go up in her driveway. Because the main street. Yeah, b cuz the main street is to the right of her house. Is the driveway already there? The driveway is already at the next door neighborhood. That was done, done without a permit. And which did d PI tell them to correct that? What, did, did the county tell the neighbor to correct that? Yes. No, if they paved on your property, that's partially your driveway. Actually, no, it's actually the county's property because it does it, you know, really at the sidewalk. The sidewalk is the problem. That's where this fix we have. She has her fence going straight down there. Their driveway is on the other side of her fence line. But when it gets down to PG County's property, then it comes over into the sidewalk. And they did their own, own curve, you know, and which, which they, what they should have done was demo the retaining wall in front of their house to move it closer to their house so we could have had the space to make ours straight. But the problem is, is when it gets to PG County's property, that's where you see in that term. You're talking about the public utility easement, ma'am. You're talking about the ten foot public utility easement along the road. No, I'm what I'm, I'm talking about the sidewalk and in front of the houses. Right. That's the p. That's the public utility easement. Oh, okay. Right. So that's where, that's where, if we did ours when they came out to look, that they said, no, you all have to have that separation from that existing driveway that was done without a permit. Okay, so what it is, it's the apron that is extending too far, because aprons have to be a certain distance apart. So the. Try. The triangle of the apron is too close to your property, so you can't put your triangle in there. Right. The only other driveway, it's. It's not the driveway itself. It's the apron triangles. Exactly. Correct. And so, you know, we were hoping that we could just bump up to their apron an", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Anthony Henderson", "insights": [{"observation": "The proposal is to do the driveway retaining wall.

Okay. Miss Olga, could you scroll up to exhibit four a? It says 85 23. Four a through dap. Is that the picture? Let me get over there. Yeah, yeah. Whose driveway is that on the right? The house next door. So where in your driveway? Pretty much where that little tree is. Yeah, we. Yeah, we have to dig out, you know, part of the yard and put a retaining wall right there. This board member ricer would be possible to combine the aprons. Was that not possible at this time? That's what I want to do. No, that's not permitted. That would be. That would be ideal. If we could swear in Mister Swan, he may be able to explain. Mister Swan still here? Yes. Mister Swan. Mister George, County Inspector Swan want you to raise your right hand so that we could square you in for this case, please. Do you solemnly swear our firm, under the penalties of perjury, that responses given and statements made will be the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I do. Thank you. Mister Swan, could you explain why the two aprons can't touch? I'm sorry, I'm drawing a blank. They have to. There has to be clear separation between the two. If there is damage to one, then that the respective party would be responsible for repair. So they cannot share an apron even if it's a double apron? No, ma'am. And then the other thing is that the driveways can't be on the property line. They have to be offline. Right? The driveways can't be what, sir? On the property line they have to be off the line. There has to be some separation between two, right? They. You have to have that 3.5ft out there where the apron is. It has to be a separation out there. Yes, yes. The tips can touch, but not. You can't have one continuous apron. Is this a couple of houses up the street? That is exactly like that. Okay. Also, since this is where that. And we'll address it. Since this is a brand new driveway, you are required. Excuse me. I mean. Hold on. Hold on, sir. Hold on for a moment. Hold on a second. Mister Henderson. The. The problem is when you put in a new driveway, the code says that you must provide three and a half feet from the property line. That's driveway has to be angled at the front property line. There must be three and a half feet from the edge of the driveway to the property line. How far is this driveway going back? Is it going all the way back to the end of the house? It's going back pretty much past the gate. But not all the way to. Not all the way to the back of the house? No. The back end of the house? No, it's pretty much to the front of the house. Oh, that looks like they're at an angle. That ten foot line is where it's going to stop. Yes, ma'am. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not looking at you. I can't see nothing that you all are looking at. But I kind of going on memory with the. With a plan. Unfortunately, we can't straighten that line out for you. All right. So it's going to have to have that curve if it's approved, yes. And then the retaining wall will run to the left side of the driveway and the retaining wall is three and a half feet. You do not need a variance for the retaining wall, but need a permit. Okay. What is that going to do about water flow to your neighbor's driveway? Well, I don't think that that's going to be a problem. I mean, because the weep holes are going to be in the battalion wall. So it's just going to, you know, because it's basically on a hill, so everything don't drain to the street. This is Boardman Reichsler. As proposed. It looks like the driveway will run up to the property line of the neighbors. Is, is that where why the various is needed? Because the three and a half feet won't be there? No, because because of the three and a half feet which they're required to provide, the driveway is now in front of the house. The end of the driveway is now in front of the house. That look curvy area. Yeah. Oh, for the. So for that one little train. Right. And that's a site road approval? Yes, it is. And the site road approval includes the apron approval? Yes, that's correct. When I come in, that will be so going. All going along the neighbor's driveway just before it starts curving. It doesn't need to be a separation there. Um. There. Go ahead, Mister Savon. That that, um, DPie will, will address that. Okay. So because of the code, they have to have that three and a half foot setback from the property", "esg_v1": [{"name": "County Public Works Department", "insights": [{"observation": "New driveway installations must provide three and a half feet from the property line, as per code.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Retaining wall for new driveway requires a permit but no variance is needed.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Driveways cannot share a continuous apron; there must be clear separation between them.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The new driveway has to be angled at the front property line, maintaining three and a half feet from the edge of the driveway to the property line.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Permitting process evaluates potential water flow issues to neighboring driveways.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "County Public Works Department", "insights": [{"observation": "New driveway installations must provide three and a half feet from the property line, as per code.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Retaining wall for new driveway requires a permit but no variance is needed.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Driveways cannot share a continuous apron; there must be clear separation between them.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The new driveway has to be angled at the front property line, maintaining three and a half feet from the edge of the driveway to the property line.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Permitting process evaluates potential water flow issues to neighboring driveways.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 7536964, "chunk_end_time": 8125704, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3452?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3452?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=7536"}, {"start": 69000, "end": 75000, "text": "cause it's basically on a hill, so everything don't drain to the street.

So because of the code, they have to have that three and a half foot setback from the property line to the driveway. Because of that, the driveway is now located in front of the house. That's the whole gist of the problem. I'm not. I'm not sure I understand that. This is Gail Duggar. You say in front of the house. Um, are you looking at, um, this? Are we looking at the site plan? Well, it says exhibit two, v 8523 is what I'm looking at, yes. Okay, when you say in front of the house, do you mean like in front of her door? Because. No. Well, take a straight line from the corner of your house and go all the way down, and you'll see it's not a straight line. That little portion there is in front of the house. No part of the driveway can be located directly in front of the house. So like madam chair said, that side line of the house, if you drew that line straight down to the street, the driveway is now in the front yard of the house. If the driveway were straight, you know, along the property line, there'd be no problem. But the code says that when you put in a new driveway, you've got to be at least three and a half feet at the front property line, three and a half feet away from the property line. Once you hit the house, then it can go to the property line. Okay, so you came around. Okay. Hey, look, are you all, uh. Yeah. Excuse me. Who is that speaking? Who's speaking? No, my phone is missing. Look, I got the people on. Alex. Excuse me, Mister Henderson? Yeah, but they need to talk to you, Mister Henderson. And I think you're speaking with someone else in there.

I believe he's on the petitioners on cell phone, and there's an issue with device not being in anyone, a meeting, dominion or control. Mm hmm.

Okay. Can we just swear him in? Can we get you to raise your right hand so that we can swear you in? Is he on. On camera? Yes, he's on camera. Okay. Can we get you to raise your right hand so that we could swear you in? Yes. Do you solemnly swear our firm, under the penalties of perjury, that response is given and the statements made will be the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Yes, I swear. I don't think we got your address. Can we get your address? 5801 Shepherd Lane, Lanang, Maryland. I'm sorry, what's the street name again? Shepherd. Shepherd. Sh. E p p a r d. Yes. Okay. Okay. And you had a comment you wanted to add to the record? Um, by my, uh. My partner. He. He called me and say, you guys need to know something about what are we doing with the driveway. Do you have the plans? Yes. We were explaining to them that this is designated as in front of the house because they had to move over 3ft towards the front. We. We did move three and a half feet already, but this wrong. This is where the apron is going to be. Uh huh. And, uh, we already did that. Well, we can't change what's already on there. What the site roads put on. So you want. You want to be the three and a. The 3.5ft all the way from the property line? No, from the front of the. I think it's a little bit before the front of the house. We want you to construct exactly what site roads has approved. And that's. That's where we are right now. Because, uh. We wanted to do exact what they asked. Like that we can keep going forward because, uh, the customer, she don't mind long if we build her driveway because we've been since last year back and forth, back and forth. And we don't have no answers. So all she wants is to have a little driveway. And that's it. The way you see any picture, that's the way they told me. And he's okay with. And we are. So we are all in the same pace already. So I need to ask Miss Brown a question. Miss Brown, why do you need the driveway? Because the parking on the street is imminent. Is that a problem for the entire neighborhood? Yes. So what do they do? They have driveways.

Is that a problem for the entire neighborhood? Yes. So what do they do? They have driveways. And this is Gail doctor. My mom is also 84 years old and she's restricted to how she comes and goes sometimes. She does not want to be out in the evening because she doesn't have anywhere to park where she's safe, walking to her house. Do we have an Ariel? Miss, do you have a wife? Aerial. Could you put up an aerial? Do you want to see any specific picture? No, just want. You're doing good. Okay. What did your neighbor say about your proposal? I haven't talked to. You have it? No. Are you in a municipality? No. This is morbid vice. Go ahead, chairmax. Sorry. No, go ahead. I was going to ask, is there hoa for the neighborhood? No. No. Are these single families or duplexes? Duplex. So the. This is Gail Duggar again. The house that's adjoined to her has a driveway. And the house that she will be butting the driveway has. Has a driveway. People across the street, both of them have driveways as well. This is board member Eisler. It appears that the lots are similarly shaped. Is there something different about your lot? Is there a specific hillside or slope or something that makes it unique in any way? So this is Gail Duggar speaking again. There is a hillside, but it's my clear understanding that they're going to have to feel that in order to make the driveway level, I think the contractor said they were going to have to excavate a lot of dirt on that side. Then what? You'd have to walk up steps to get to the house? No, because they would level it off. And then, um, the. So it's a hill to the right of the house, but then there's a front yard that's flat. This is actually. So they're going to slope the driveway down towards. Towards the street. So they're going to. Well, that I'm not sure. But again, there's a slope on the side that meets the driveway to the neighbor. And my understanding is that they're going to fill that area and build the driveway. And then the top of the. The front yard is already flat. So they would just build, I guess, like a walkway or put stones so that she could walk to the front door. Is it going to be a retaining wall or anything? Yes, it is. Yes. How high? Uh, we calculate the level of the private house going to be probably like two, two and a half feet. And, uh, she probably has like one or two step with railing on both sides. This right where she's going to park her vehicle, we're going to put a, like one or two steps and then all, all the way. All the, like 28ft. From the house to this tree is going to be a small rectangle. This board member actually on the site plan looks like the retainer was going to be three and a half feet. And I don't see any documentation of steps or railing or walk to the front door. No, it's not. If you're adding steps on that side, we need that on the plan, don't we, Miss Stone? Yes. And is anything identified here as a retaining wall? I can't see that. Yes, it is on the site plan. That's from the site plan. We do need to show the steps, but can we give the permit and we keep going forward? And then I put any prints or any, or any site plan the steps? No, you must provide us with adequate site plans before they make a decision because DP. They don't even say anything that I need to put that in there. Did you mention it? Yes, I did. Because they know is going to be a retain wall in, um. And as soon as she parked her vehicle. So she need to walk right away to. To the left. To the left where she's going to the front door. Because otherwise. Otherwise you gotta go back all the way out to the sidewalk and then walk again to the front door. So basically don't make sense to build a driveway. She's gonna be doing all that. It's like almost parking her vehicle in front of the house. Can I ask Inspector Swan, on this site plan that was approved, it doesn't show. It shows the retaining wall, but it doesn't show any type of steps or walkway. Doesn't site roads normally have them put that on there because they need a permit for that? Exactly. It would have to be identified. Yes. Were the case. Otherwise that would be a deviation that would require revision. Right. They would not allow you to build that, those steps or walkway without being part of the permit. And this site plan right here is part of your permit. Right. So you need to revise, go back to site roads and revise your site plan to demonstrate where the steps on the walkway are going. So we've been in the process since. Since last year, almost more than nine or ten months. If I go and if I go back, it will take the same amount of time. Why I don't understand why it's taking that long to apply for a permit? Well, for a driveway. That's what I'm saying. Why they make me do die. Why they made her doing all these for so much, so many time, like almost a year. And the other neighbors, they doing illegal stuff and they already had drag with every single one in that, in that role, we cannot compare. No, we can't. This legal?

My question is, it will take a long time to go back to how that I have to go do another review with you again or all I got to do is add the step in the print and that's it. We would need to see the site plan again with the added steps. But the problem is you have an approved site roads permit for the ten by 35 driveway. Right. That does not include the steps or the walkway. You have to go back to the permit office, revise your permit to add the steps and walkway, get a revised plan with a new stamp and submit that to us. Okay, I do that. Okay. Then your steps might take another 2ft off of the top of that driveway. But you do need to go back to site roads and add that if that's what you all want. Okay. And I just want to say one thing. Someone needs to change their batteries on their smoke detector. I thought it was mine. Yeah, I was asking around in my house also. Any other questions or concerns we need to put on the record? None from Bobby. What? Member Austin? No questions. Everything. Any questions, Miss Brown? I was wondering about the curve. I'm sorry, what was that again? I was wondering about the curve. Now, when I back into the. On the driveway, how far would that be from my house? It's. It's. The driveway itself is 35ft in length. So you wouldn't. Your car would not go all the way back. I mean, it's not going to be 35ft. It's going to be maybe 10ft that you have to back in ten to 15ft. Okay, I'd like to go ahead. I think I heard something about the people who are in violation. Is, does a complaint need to be issued for them or do. Now that you've heard that it's generated, we don't address it. You would have to generate that. You could call 311 or you could call D PI. Is that correct, Mister Swan? Yes, ma'am, they can. I am a district of Columbia resident. What is deep?

Did we not hear this case before for the basket or. We were hearing it for the basketball court, which I believe did not need a variance. And you went straight for permits for. Is that correct? That is correct. Actually, I thought at that time also dealing with this because it was already in existence. I thought we were dealing with this also, but eventually when I got the letter, it was stating that I didn't need a variance for the court, I think defense, but not mentions this. Barbara, can I say something? It was her before for the fence. This is Ruth Conti speaking. Hold on, hold on. Miss Conti? Yes? Ruth Conti, you're at. Ruth Conti, could we get your address for the record? 9201 Edgeworth Drive, Capital Heights, Maryland, 20791. Your relationship to this property? I'm actually the permanent expediter who's a obtaining the permit. Did we get you to raise your right hand so that we could swear you in? Okay. Do you solemnly swear under the penalties of perjury, that the responses given, the statements made, will be the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I do. Thank you. So, Miss Stone, he didn't need a security fence thing at that time? No, because he met the setbacks and he could go straight to permits. All right, so we're here now for these additions he wants to build. I believe the application set a twelve by twelve deck, a ten by 22 deck, and a twelve by ten screen porch. Is that correct, mister? You know, yes. Okay. This board member, ice, I believe they're all existing already. Is that correct? That is correct. Mister Enoch was a violation issued. Is that why you needed the variance? That is correct. So you built these things already? The contractor built the decks without permits. Mister Enoch was under the impression that the contractor had obtained a permit. Sorry, this is Ruth Conti speaking. The permit. The contractor went to the permits office to attempt to obtain a permit. It looks like in 2019, the contractor obviously was told that he couldn't obtain a permit and went to Mister Enoch's house and proceeded to build the decks and everything without a permit. Mister Enoch was not aware that he did not obtain a permit. This is board member Austin, chair Mack. If you look at picture D, you can see the decks and the screen porch is already done. If you can pull that up, Miss Olga, you can see the work is already done. Yes. D or e? No d you have it? That's it. Okay, that's it. This is boy Brisler. Was the contractor the builder or was the contractor separate from the building? It was. It was separate from the building, but a licensed contractor with an MHIC did not pull the permits, and Mister Enoch wasn't aware of that. And you can look, I don't know if you have d five online permitting system. You can see in the system where the contractor went in to obtain those permits and it just stayed in application mode. So we're trying to validate because he did receive the complaint, not knowing that he didn't have a permit. So we're trying to validate the construction. This board member Isler. The permit history does show that the application was made in 20, in March of 2020. And when was it actually built? In 2020, I'm sure. So the contractor went to permits and was he denied permits or was he just didn't follow through with it? I believe he was probably made aware that a variance was required and just didn't follow through with it and just went back to the job and did the construction and moved on. And when did the violation show up? The violation was 20. Are you on the system? I want to say 2022, Prince George's County. Inspector Swan. Mister Swan. One of my inspectors actually issued the violation, but I'm familiar with it. And we square you in for this case, Mister Swan? Yes, ma'am. Do you solemnly swear our firm, under the penalties of perjury, that the responses given in statements made will be the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Yes. Thank you. Okay, Mister Swan, we always appreciate your input. The violation was actually issued in February of 23, 2023, and there are some issues that have yet to be addressed. The driveway extension is one of them. So the contractor put in a driveway extension as well. Mister Enoch, who put in the driveway extension? Actually, it wasn't the contractor. When they built the house, they came back to resurface the driveway at that time. That was when they asked us if we want to extend it? Honestly, innocently. We didn't know. We need to do anything. It was the builder that sent the pavers to do to resurface the driveway and the axles. And if you go to the estate, 95% of us resurfaced everything and extended the one car driveway from the original the way it was made. Did they charge you? Yeah, they charge us with it.

No, I'm asking what your reference is. Is it the citation of the correctional. I don't. I don't have it up because I applied for the permit based on whatever I received from Enoch. Mister Enoch? Yeah, I'm actually board member, actually, just for the record, we don't have a notice of violation or the correction or in our binders, and we should. Let me see if I could send those to. I'm not sure whose case this is to your. It's my case. I. I think that he sent that information. Let me. Yeah, I'm pulling it up. I'm double checking to Celeste. Yeah, I do remember asking for it. Okay, let's see. Yeah, if we could get those, or if we do have them, just throw them in the binder. In the binder. Okay. Yes, I sent. I sent that to. You specifically asked for that. And I. Let's see. So do we advertise for driveway? No, you said we didn't need to. It's included in lot coverage, though. It is? Yes, and they don't need lot coverage. So the driveway is not a variant issue. It's a permit issue. Okay. I'll just apply for the driveway permit itself from the building permit anyway. So I'll just put in for a driveway permit tomorrow. Anything else we need to put on the record? So the drive issue, it's just the decks and the screen porch, I guess. Yes. And Mister Swan have those. You said they needed to have been some rectification on those. I'm looking in, Miss Conte, you may be able to correct me. Is there. Did he. Has he applied for the permit for the patio itself, also to be included with the decks, because that would, that would figure into coverage. No, there's. I haven't applied for a permit for patio. I just applied for whatever was on the order that I received. Okay. The original permit, I believe it is 1275-0202 includes both decks. The screen porch. Yeah. Should it say anything about patio? No, it just says a twelve by 13. A twelve by twelve and ten by ten. And then the screen porch being twelve by twelve. So there's three different dimensions there. I don't know if that includes the porch. How big is the porch? The twelve x twelve is the deck. The ten by 22 is a deck. On the twelve by twelve is this green porch. There's three, there are three different decks that are on. See, that's in the system. Wait a minute, let me see if I could bring it up. If you look at this picture, the ten by 22 is the one to the right of the picture. You're looking at the screen porch. You will see the door of the screen porch above the deck, which is the twelve x 22. When you look at the left, that is where you have the twelve by twelve where the step coming down. Okay. So there's two decks in a screen porch. Why are we counting three? Yeah, I see two decks in this green porch. Yeah. I don't see three decks. No, separate, I think he separated the screen porch from the screen porch is what I'm counting as the third one. Right. But on the application itself it says, let me go back to it. The twelve by 13 deck. A twelve by twelve and a ten by ten. And then a screen porch, twelve by twelve. So that's four different dimensions and that's what the contractor had applied for. So it was whatever the contractor had requested. I think the step, the one on the left, the first step down is one of the dimension. I think it's talking about when the picture d that you just showed. If you look at the left, the twelve by twelve, the step down, the first step down before you go come down the steps. The steps. That is what is probably referring to as ten by ten to. Okay. So could the concrete patio be part of those dimensions? No, no, no, I don't think so. What's the size of the patio? Do you know the size of the patio? I don't have it here. This is Borneo, Iceland. Who constructed the patio? Was that the same contractor or was that the building? No, no, the same contractor did everything. That's the main Maryland deck. Okay. This board member, Isler. Miss Olga, could you go to the site plan? Because I think I see four different decks in the site plan. It looks like there are two on the left and two on the right and they have the dimensions there. Green forge. Well that's hard to tell. Okay. If you look at it that is the step coming down. 0000 right. If you see three decks on the left hand side there is a twelve by twelve deck and then there is almost a circular deck and then you go down the steps to the concrete patio. If you cross the patio and go up the steps there's the third deck and then this. The sunroom. The screen porch. Yeah. So they just split that deck on the left into two. A lot going on there. Yeah, but it is pretty. It is pretty beautiful. Okay, then what do we have to do to make sure you are illegal? You have some things to do.

Yeah, but it is pretty. It is pretty beautiful. Okay, then what do we have to do to make sure you are illegal? You have some things to do. Well it sounds like the driveway is an issue in the patio so we need to get a permit at a permit for a driveway and a patio needs to be added. And I don't know if it's going to be part of the variance or not. No. Well it depends if lot coverage. Miss Olga, could you check what the lot coverage is right now? But that was, that driveway was included. It's not overlock coverage. Yeah, I didn't think it would be. Okay. The driveway doesn't need a variance. The only thing that needs the variances is to validate the two decks and the screen porch. Okay. So there's nothing that we need other than a decision from the board. This is board member island. So where's the 9ft yard which was side yard width? Side yard width is on the left hand side if I'm looking at the front of that. Okay, so is that corner of the house is the corner of the decks that's closest to that property. Yeah. One of them is almost on the sidewalk, isn't it? Well remember also this is a corner lot so you need 25ft from Celeste Bruce Circle and you need 25ft from Colvin court. The Colvin court is fine. It meets by 30. It's 30 plus feet. And then the front yard which is Celeste Bruce Circle meets that. They have 33ft there. So the side yard only it says it's eight plus or minus. Yeah, that's what, that's what I was trying to figure out where the nine, like how much, how much is actually needed area and 9ft side yard width. Celeste, do you remember what that 9ft was for? You said 9ft side yard width. Yes it is. Sorry, I'm trying to get back to the window. It's stuck there. We go. Oh, I see. Do you see how the. I think that is a deck that crosses a building restriction line. Oh, that's right there. It's. It's a more than likely this property. If I look at the subdivision plat, it was probably done by detailed site plan and the setbacks are determined through the resolution of the detailed site plan. Here it is right there. Resolution number 06277. No, that's the health department. I'm looking. Hold on. Approval. This plot is based upon reason hex pack. Oh, it's. Committee can tank. No, it has to be a detailed site plan. Oh, it's lot size averaging. That's why. So the building restriction lines are determined in resolution per section 24 121. A twelve of. Oh, it's cut off. Hold on a second. So regulations of Prince George's county code. So it's regular. It's the subdivision regulations that creates the building restriction line and that's why the setbacks are not being met. But he built outside of it, didn't he? Yes, yes. Out of the building restriction line. Yes, that's correct. Yes. Sorry. Earlier when you mentioned the violation notices, mister Enoch, he submitted citations, which was why I didn't include them in the binder. But if you want me to, I will. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. We don't use citations. We only use violation notices. Okay. That's why as long as they're in the file, that's all that matters. But yes, the 9ft is the deck that's crossing the building restriction line because it was done under lot size averaging and the development standards were determined during the subdivision review per the resolution, section 24. So the only thing we need is we don't. They don't need to submit anything else. We have everything we need. It's just a determination. Excuse me? A determination that needs to be made if we can validate or not. Okay. Anything else to put on the record now was this woman Weissman? Is there an issue with the neighbor and the deck being too close to their fence? Not at all. I went through the hoa. They approved it. You know, the last time I was here I was asked to go through Hoa, which I didn't because at that time there was no hoa when I came. So when they reconstituted the Hoa, I was asked that I should go back to the Hoa, which I did, and I don't know whether I forwarded it, so I don't have any. And I was told by all my neighbors that they received registered letter that. Why are they troubling you again, that would say. That's not troubling. They just want to do their job. So everyone. I don't see any single person that has any problem with it. It's not encroaching on anybody, it's even within my fence, you know, so. Well, could you send us that letter from the hoa? I think we provided it. Barbara, do you have the letter from the Hoa or Celeste, probably at the. On the last variance we have it. Okay, if not, let me know and I'll send it over. Yeah, he said it didn't exist then. No, we recently. He had to get. It was a requirement for the variant, so we had to submit it along with the variant. So it's a recent approval from the HOA.

Thank you, madam chair. Aye. Mister Eisler? Aye. Miss Alston? Aye. Motion carries 30. Okay. Thank you all for participating. Mister. Thank you all. Thank you so much. Thank you, Ruth. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. Our next case is v. 224. Mister David Kucharski. This is a request for a security exemption for a fence over 4ft in height in the front yard abutting Caswell Lane, to install a six foot fence at 3705 Madea Lane and Bowie. Is Mister Chikarsky here? Yes, ma'am. David Kucharski. Nice to meet you. Same here. Could we get your address for the record? Sure. 3705 Media Lane, Bowie, Maryland, 20715. Is anyone else here for this case? No. I am. I'm a neighbor. I am. Could I get your name and address? Yes. Katherine Barrett Gaines. 12419 Shelford Lane, Bowie, Maryland. I'm sorry, could you. I have to type all this. Can you repeat that, please? Yes, my whole name. Catherine Barrett Gaines. How do you spell Gaines? Gaines. The last name is a hyphenated name. Barrett Gaines. B a r e t t g as in girl Aines. Oh, I got it. Right. Okay. And your address? 12419 Chalford. Link, Chelford. Spell that for me. C h a l f as in Frank, o r d. Okay. Thank you, madam chair. For the record, this is within the city limits of Bowie, but due to the current code not allowing anyone but the board of appeals to grant security exemptions, all municipalities for exertion. Excuse me. For security exemptions must come through the board of appeals. Okay, could I get you all to raise your. Anyone else here for this case? Could I get you all to raise your right hand so that we could swear your testimony in, please? Good evening. Do you solemnly swear. I affirm under the penalties of perjury that the responses given and the statements made will be the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Okay, Mister Czakowski, could you tell us what you're proposing to do on the property? Yes, ma'am. Thanks for your time. I know it's getting very late. I really appreciate this. As you look at the photos of our property, you see that I have one of those unusually shaped corner lots. And on our property, we have a four foot fence that's abutting up against the Caswell Lane side of our house. And I have learned that the county officially recognizes this area as my front yard by your guidelines. But for all practical purposes, this area really serves and functions as our backyard, as you can probably see from these photos here. So I would like to replace the existing four foot fence that you see right there with a six foot privacy fence in order to provide some much needed privacy in our backyard. And I did first check with the city of Bui codes office. They said this would definitely be in compliance with their codes for the city. They did write a memorandum for me which supports this. It's included here in my binder with the application. And the city of Bueco's office suggested that I pursue a permit or security exemption for this fence with PG county because they believe this would be something that should be reasonably approved. So tonight, I'm seeking your approval for security exemption to replace that existing four foot fence with a six foot poverty fence that's abutting up against Caswell Lane. Thank you for your consideration. So this is the front of your house here? Well, officially, the Caswell Lane side is officially considered by your guidelines as the front yard. But for all practical purposes, what you see this large spot on media lane is really the front of the house. And our address is media lane, which I mean, really makes it practically the front of the house. So what we're looking at is the white picket fence there now. And you want to replace that? That's correct, yes, ma'am. And it's going to go in the exact same spot? Yes. Will it impair traffic coming around that corner? No, I don't believe so at all. Will that fence be set back? Will be. Excuse me, will the six foot fence be in the same location as the white picket? Yes, ma'am, the exact same existing location. And according to the Bowie codes that was in compliance. This board member, is the rest of the fencing around the house 6ft already? Yes, sir. You want it all to meet up to be six foot all the way around? Yes, ma'am.

Six foot, correct where the sidewalk is? Yes. It's a three foot sidewalk, I believe. Did we give you a written recommendation? Yes, ma'am. The memorandum is included in my binder. Okay. Okay. The city of Bowie council adopted revisions to fence setback requirements on April 17, 2023. You've had it a while, huh? The ages were approved by Prince George's county council on May 16, 2023 and took effect June 16, 2023. And in the case of 3705 media lane, Bowie, Maryland, the amendment allows the location of the existing fence to be in compliance with the city of Bowie code. Any replacement or new fence positioned in the same location will also be in compliance with the city of Bowie code. If there are any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me. And the phone number is there for J. Braun, city of Bowie organization. He's the code compliance officer. Yeah. Now we do have Miss Barrett. Barrett Gaines. Did you have something you wanted to add to the case? No, I was just really curious. We. This is our neighborhood, and I would. We saw the sign go up. I wanted to make sure that it wasn't going to be some kind of crazy fence out in the middle of our neighborhood, so I wanted to make sure it makes sense. What is. What's. What's here makes sense to me. Can we see a sample of what type of fence you're putting up? Did you send us one? Yes, ma'am. There are a couple of samples in there. This boy vibration. I believe it exhibits three a and b. Yeah, I think three a is the one to look at. It has lattice on top. Okay, I don't. I don't see it coming up on the screen. My computer's out. I can't get it. Is it straight white, or does it have a brown insert? Well, it'll have the lattice on top. It'll have a gray. A dark gray insert. So I included both of those photos. Oh, okay. It's gonna be a combination of the two. Yes. Gotcha. Member Austin? Um, three B is a good photo. Okay, so that's the. That is the color scheme. That would be the color of the insert. So is this. Which one are you betting? And that will be the lattice version of it. That will be with the lattice on top. And that is from the company that will do the fence. Mid Atlantic fence. What about the colors? Are the lattice fence going to have those two colors in them? The centerpiece will be dark gray, like you saw in the previous photo. Everything else will be white. The lattice and the posts will be white. So, in other words, the. It looks like a gray and white with the lattice on top. Correct. I just want to make sure Miss Barrett understands what it's going to be. Sure. Yeah, my interest was the placement of it. And, you know, around here, we have fences in the backyard and not in the front. And he's our neighbor, is correct. When he describes his unusual shape lot and what he is describing. Even though Bowie might. You know, we might see that as his front yard, that is effectively his backyard, because it's a sliding glass door, et cetera. So any reasonable person who lived there would see that as their backyard. So he is reasonably putting, it looks to me, a fence around his backyard. Okay, so you have no issues with the type of fencing or colors? Oh, no, no. That is absolutely none of our business. People can choose whatever. Whatever fence they want. It's the placement that we care about. More concerned about that. So he is replacing the fence that is already there, right? Yep. He's just going up another 2ft. Can I just ask, David, why. Why did you have that little tiny fence there originally? Why wasn't that originally made and made up a big fence? It. It was there when we moved in. Okay. Yep. It's been over 20 years now. It's been there. It's time to replace it. Yeah. Yeah. So I figured as long as I'm replacing it, I'd like to have privacy. Finally. Yeah. Busy corner. Yes. I'm hoping you put me. I'm hoping you put the trees up back up in the back and you're back and fence in the back along the alley. That would be great, because right now you're your port. Your poor house is just wide open. I feel bad for you. Well, the fence is already approved for the backyard, so the same fence will be replacing where the old backyard fence used to be. Yeah. Yeah. And we'll have new landscaping back there. So it will have life again. Yeah. Their property had a whole bunch of giant pine trees that were really wreaking havoc. They were very problematic with all of our storms over the years. This family's been through a lot with their. With their yard. I can imagine. Any other questions?

They were very problematic with all of our storms over the years. This family's been through a lot with their. With their yard. I can imagine. Any other questions? I do have one question if I might ask. Sure. Can we go to that one photo of looking straight to the front of the garage and the driveway in the. In the fence, please? Right there? No, with the. With the garage. Oh, he wants the white picket fence. Yes, sir. Yes, that one. Thank you. That's right. My question is, is it acceptable for the fence line to be instead of to the very edge of our house right there as you see it? Could it be like 2ft to the right of there? Is that an issue? No, unless Bowie has an issue. Okay. Because we've already sent the plans to them. Right. They're looking at the same plans we are, but also your site plan should reflect that. So if you want to move that, that means you have to send us revised plans. Where's. Well, you really don't have it indicated. It really doesn't. I don't think it should be a problem because the X's are pretty much close to the kind of. In that spot. Yes. Yeah, already there, so. Okay. I don't think it would be an issue unless, you know, Bowie would have an issue. Okay, great. You think he needs to run it by them, though? She. Well, I've been. I've visited them multiple times. They were fine with everything that I had asked and the site. And this is the same site plan that they saw? Yes, they did. Yes. So it indicates that the fence is not on the corner of the house. It indicates that it's in. Slightly in. Slightly in. Okay. Any other questions or concerns? No, ma'am. No, ma'am. Anyone want to make a motion, or. We want to. Hello. I can make a motion. Board member Austin? I make a motion that we approve the plans for v. 224 as submitted. 224 as submitted. My apologies, ma'am. Chairman, step in for a moment. I think we're still waiting for information from the city of Bowie. Well, he said we might want to take the case under advisement. You mean for the 2ft? He wants to come in? Correct. We need to get. Just get something from them. Something in writing saying that they approve that. Yeah. Affirmation that. That's okay. Can you do that, Mister Kocharski? Sure. I could do that tomorrow. Um. Who do I send it to? You can send your case reviewer, who's. Okay, Olga or Celeste? Who is the reviewer? Miss Barlow. Miss Barlow has. Well, they've both been in touch. Yes. Okay. Well, you can just send it to Miss Bartlett. That's fine. Great. Thank you. And then we'll be able to make the determination at our next meeting, which is two weeks. I see. Okay, great. We need a revised motion or substitute motion from another member. We get a substitute motion. Make a motion. Substitute motion to hold this case open for additional documentation from the petitioner. Yeah, I second. 1 second. I got to do some quick maneuvering here. We just want to make sure all of our eyes are dot and t's are crossed. Yeah, sure. I just have to make some quick while she's doing that. This is Kathryn Barrett Gaines, the neighbor. I just have to say, I've been on this meeting all night, and I'm so impressed with the way this board runs and with you, madam chair. And the whole thing has been such a great education in the way it just makes me feel so good about Prince George county and our home. So I really appreciate your work, all of you. Well, thank you so much. Thank you. Okay, Allison. And then, madam chair, you made the motion to. No, that was done by Miss Altitude. No. Mister Eisler? Mister Eisler, I'm sorry, I. Second. My computer is not cooperating with me. Hold on 1 second. There we go. Okay. Eisler and madam chair. Okay. Madam chair. Aye. Mister Eisler? Aye. Thank you. Miss Austin? Aye. Thank you. Motion carries. 30. Okay. Thank you all for participating. Thank you. Could I just ask, do I. Do I attend the next meeting? No, you don't. And I don't have to keep the signs in the yard anymore. No. Okay. You can add it to your new fence. Thank you. Those are beautiful signs. They are? Yeah, they're. They're pretty alarming. That's why we can came. It's like, what the heck is going on? Yeah, they're pretty scary. I'll be happy to see those go. Those are pepper small pink. Thank you all. Thank you again for your time. Take care. Have a good night. Take your. After this case, I'm going to need a five. Okay. Okay. Our next case is V 324. James Andriana Bowers.

Okay, well, could I get you all to raise your right hand so that we could swear your testimony in, please? Good evening. Do you solemnly swear? I affirm under the penalties of perjury that the responses given in the statements made will be the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Okay, who's going to start out telling us what you're proposing to do? I think she wants me to. But, uh. So we're just trying to make our house nicer, better. And we wanted to put a two story addition on the. On the right hand side of the house. This was two lots and they built over the property line. As you can see, so you can't split them and subdivide them. So our idea was to build a nicer house, try to keep with the same look of what we had going, that cape Cod. And then as well as in the back of the house, we have a detached garage that we wanted to make a little bit bigger so it'd be more usable. And then all the stuff that you see in red was stuff that somebody had added over the years. We want to remove it all. And, I mean, at the end of the day, we're just trying to have a nice, clean house. We want the garage sided and matching the house. We want the house to be all sided and look, you know, very clean, very finished. So you're saying the area that's marked in red is going to be removed? Yes. We're going to rip all those things off that way. It's just a house in a garage. So you're putting another story on the garage? No, behind it. So the section that's in white there is what's there now. And it has a. An addition on the front of that garage that you can see all scratched out in red. So what we want to do is rip off that red section and then pretty much double the garage by expanding behind it. So you're building another house? Pretty much. My mother retired recently and, you know, Social Security is not really enough to live. And school teacher, she didn't. Big pensions, you know. So we're trying to move my mom in with us and take care of my mother. So we needed. And I have three boys that are getting really big and can't share bedrooms anymore. What is that other red area to the left of the garage? It was like a lean to that was here when we bought the house. So it's just a roof, a metal roof. I guess the. It just was for putting stuff under so it wouldn't get wet. So this new addition on the. On your original house is larger than your original house? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Our house is a Cape Cod. I mean, it's only a one and a half story. The basement's only six, not even 7ft tall in the basement. What are your neighbors saying about your signs out? Nothing. They stop and look. I mean, we got probably 1015 people every day we. That we've seen. They stop. They read the signs. They look. I've known the neighbor immediately next to us. I've known her for the last 23 years. My dad was the last owner of this house and then he bought it from a friend of his that was the owner for however many years before that. So we've known that neighbor since she moved in. Okay, I'm looking at exhibit. What is that, C. Is this a three story home? Which one, the exhibit circle? No, it'll be two stories. But, like, if you look at where the chimney is, that's the original house with that low pitch roof. So there's a basement. So the way that the grading is, there would be two windows in the basement. So it's two story with a basement. But when we asked the architect to draw the plans, we wanted, you know, normal size ceilings. So they're nine foot ceilings instead of seven and eight foot ceilings. So this with the chimney, is that the side of the home right now, the one that you're looking at there? The left side, that's showing the, what, six windows would be the new addition. And the right side with that porch is the original. The shorter one is the original house. That's why I was asking. Is it a third floor? No, still two stories. Where are these lower windows going? Basement. There's a very steep grade in the yard. Okay. This warm and rice. I was just about to ask if this. If the yard slope down so the windows in the back can be fully exposed. Our yard. Our yard slopes like 1ft every 8ft or every. Every 12ft. I mean, it's got a pretty steep grade to it. It doesn't. You don't notice it until you do something like that. And you're like, man, we started out flushing. Now, Miss Stone, the seven, was it seven yard? 7ft, front yard depth. Is that because the front of the house. I need to see the site plan. Okay, I'm sorry, Miss Olga, could you put up the site plan, please? Okay. Let's see. Request for variance of 7% lot coverage and 7ft from front yard depth. So the front yard is.

Okay, I'm sorry, Miss Olga, could you put up the site plan, please? Okay. Let's see. Request for variance of 7% lot coverage and 7ft from front yard depth. So the front yard is. It's the dimension from the edge of the porch to the street. The dimension from the street to the house is 20. Looks like small. 26, maybe. Yes. So, yes, the 7ft is from the porch, actually part of the steps to the front street line, or, excuse me, the front property line. But then new portion of the house is only 18. I'm sorry, from the new portion of the house, it's 18ft. Yes. Yes. So that would be the difference. It looks like the new addition of the house is equal or maybe a little bit further out from the porch. Equal or so. And it needs to be 25. So there's your. There's the difference. The 7ft. So it's gonna be at a slight angle in addition to the slope. No. So what we were trying to do, and it's a little easier to see in the pictures that show the front with, like, the new rendering, what it would look like, what we wanted to do because of the size of the addition, trying to match up the roof lines wouldn't really be possible. So we, we turned the roof 90 degrees to where now it's going to go drain left and right instead of front and back. And then where you can see, like she was saying, the new addition is 18 from the street. What we were, our plan was to have it even with the front porch. So that way there could be a door on the front porch to go into that section of the house. The new section we're not subdividing, but that'd be like my bedroom. So I can walk in directly into my own bedroom. But it would be even with the front porch. I mean, that porch has been there pretty much, I think, since the 1940s. It's got cinder block going all the way down. There's even a room underneath it that they, they made it into a room underneath that front porch. But it says 26ft. I'm not sure where they came up with that. I measured from the asphalt where the street stops to the front of the house is 46ft. Well, remember you have public utility easement that your property line does not stop at the asphalt. It stops at least 10ft within your property, at least. Okay. It could be further back. Barbara? Yes. So we. I think the 26ft that you're looking at was the original setback. Oh, okay. So it just didn't get removed. Okay. So the 26 is from the. I'm sorry. Yeah. Now I understand what your question was. The 26 is from our current house out to where the property line is. And then from the edge of the porch is. The porch is 8ft deep. Okay. So if we make that 8ft. I got you. And the reason we're asking for the change is, I mean, for the, the variances. I mean, if to change that, I have to go to the architect. They got to pretty much redraw the entire thing. Thing. Because we're trying to match up an old house with a new house. It was very difficult to try to fit. And it's not even a full story. Second, the second story. So we were very limited on where we can make openings to go from one house into another. And that's how it kind of worked. It made it in line with the porch. And I thought it would look. I mean, we, when the architect drew it. It looked, you know, in my opinion, looked very nice and looked very natural, like it was kind of almost always supposed to be there. Once we side it all and do it all, it should look very uniformed and very nice, very clean. Miss Olga, can we see a photograph of the garage? I'm just trying to figure out, because I'm trying to read what this says. Where is your garage doors? Is it on the front or the side? The current garage doors are right there on the front. You can see them. Okay. It's just one garage door. So there's one garage door currently right there. And on the right hand side in that addition that was on there, in the side of it like 90 degrees, is a five foot double steel doors. And we rip that off. The original garage has a 34 inch, you know, like a regular door with windows in it. Oh, okay. So, you know, the plan would be to clean up that garage door, take that building off, change out the old, you know, 60 year old door and put an actual nice clean door in. Okay. And it will remain just a garage. No living quarters at all? No, absolutely no living. There's no water, no sewage, nothing like that. Okay. This is the one in the rear. All the way in the rear? Yes. I thought you said you couldn't, um. It's a double lot but you couldn't build. Separate the lots, right? Yes. The front house is sitting over the lot line. What we were told by a foot. So now you're just going to build another house there? Yeah, we're just gonna make it bigger. It's not attached to your original? No, that's a garage. That's not what, another fluid floor? No, no, no. It's got only one floor, but it's huge. Yeah. From, from Florida. Florida. The peak of the roof is 17ft. How much? Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. To the peak of the roof or mid peak? I think to the peak of the roof is 17 and mid peak is 14. Good. Okay. Currently or the. Is that the plan? Currently, that's the what? That's that particular garage is. And then the plan was to make the new garage again, turning the roof 90 degree.

I was pretty much trying to double the grid garage. You did? Yeah. Well, my wife is very understanding and told me I can keep my tools and my toys back there. He has a lot of toys, a lot of tools. Okay. My concern of this, with the existing garage and the addition, what is the square footage of all of that area? The way it is currently with the addition? So we know it's 34. Then both garages should be 34 by 22 total. So then that would be 34 by 44. I'm sorry. Okay, so 34 by 44, you're looking at 1040 96 sqft. Yes. What is the square footage of your existing house and the addition? Uh, the addition is 2576. Okay, you're good. Never mind. Stop. You thought it was going to be bigger. The accessory building cannot be larger than the main structure on the property, right? Oh, it's. It's smaller than that. Okay. I see square footage of the addition being, what, 2005? I can't read that. Yeah. The addition alone is 2576ft. Okay. You're good. Okay. I just wanted to make sure that the garage wasn't larger than your house. My wife appreciates that. But see all the driveway, all that's coming out of there and going into the garage. So she would like her driveway back and like it nice and clean. Where's driveway going? No, the driveway is right there in that picture that you're seeing. That's all my car. Nothing? No, no, that's changing. And what are you doing in this big garage? Um, so my brother and I are blacksmiths, and we like to do artistic stuff that way. I have other laser that I, you know, do laser stuff with, and I. I do leather working and stuff like that. Woodworking. Oh, okay. Lots of fun. Okay. Yeah, that does sound fun. Neighbors say about this? The neighbors? Yeah. Have they seen your plans? The neighbors? I mean, we've talked to him a little bit about it, but we told. I mean, we've talked to him and told him we were going to try to expand and make bigger. And has anyone else in the neighborhood done that? Yeah, they built a couple additions three houses down. The guy built an addition, pretty much the same thing on his house. He had a deck at one point, and then he decided to turn it into an additional. And then they just built a whole new house, like, four houses down. Actually, they built two. Within the last couple years, they built two new houses that are much bigger. I mean, newer, better. You have quite a bit of stuff back there. Most of that's all gone at this point. We've been so my father was. Lived here for 20 years, and he was a hoarder, and we've been slowly working on getting rid of it all. He passed away? Yeah, he passed away. Unfortunately. I think Covid got him. He was 61. So we bought the house from my stepmother after he passed away. And we've been working on cleaning up and getting rid of everything that he collected for 20 years. This is boy and Brisler, Miss Celeste. With the two lots together, they still. And removing all of the other structures. They still need the lot coverage because of the driveway. The driveway is very large. That's taking up a good portion of the lot coverage. Okay. Between, you know, the existing house, the addition, the garage, and the addition and the driveway, that takes up a good bit of lot coverage. So do you have a civic association or homeowners association? No. No. Even the city of Laurel doesn't deal with us. They won't even sing cops when we call the cops, so. Oh, geez. Oh, I'm sorry. I live next door to 711, so unfortunately, there are some times that we. We've had to call the police, and then there's a big dispute over who's coming. Yeah, I was just about to ask that. So that's the 711. That's your. Your house is situated right next to. Yes. And it looks like there's something behind you house as well. Is that a car lot? That's a car lot. Okay. Which luckily, I mean, behind our house is mainly grass because he was forced to buy it in order to expand his parking lot. So he had to add more, I guess, unpaved areas, too. Any other questions or concerns we need to put on the record? Anybody like to think about it? Yes, ma'am. If there are no other questions to go on the record, I'll make my motion. None from ice with it. Okay. No questions. Board member Alston? Okay. I'd like to take this under advisement. I'd like to make a motion to take it under advisement, so move. Second. Thank you. Madam chair? Aye. Mister. Excuse me, mister Eisler? Aye. Thank you, Miss Austin. Motion carries 30. Okay. Hopefully we can have this on our next agenda. Yes. You can listen in, but there's no more testimony. Okay. Or you can wait for our correspondence. All right. But you can certainly listen in. You can go on to the county website, live stream and listen in. Okay, thank you. Be the next one. The next hearing is April 10. All right. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you all for participating.

Oh, that might be a good thing. I don't think so. Yes. All right. Discussion items, decisions. The 2023, Jerry and Sabrina Hamilton. This is a request for a variance of 5ft lot width, 9.6% lot coverage, 1.55ft front yard depth and a waiver of the parking area location requirement to validate existing conditions, a lot with front yard depth, lot coverage and driveway in the front yard and obtain a building permit for the unauthorized construction of a ten foot by 11.85 foot shed and a 9.85 foot by 16.1 foot shed at 128 free Drive in Oxon Hill. The record was held open to obtain a signed agreement between the petitioner and the Department of permitting, inspection and enforcement regarding the shed located with the recorded storm drain easement. That should read within the recorded storm drain easement. Oh, I missed it. No, it was a typo. She did receive the agreement with DPI. Oh, they did? And it's on the screen? Yes. See, it's somewhat of a long agreement. I don't know that you want to actually read the whole thing into the record. I'll let Mister Eisler read it if we need to. I have read it and it pretty much says that you can have the shed there, but if we need to tear it down, we need to tear it down. So they've agreed to that? Yes. Now I was wondering, when we go through these like this, should we then bring up the criteria or it's just not on these? Because I noticed a couple of decisions you made. You put the criteria in there? Oh, no, I put the criteria in all of them. Oh. But I think starting very soon, this is one of the older ones. We'll start from today when we have a discussion item on the next group. This group, the one that we just did today? Yes. Okay. Definitely. Because we have to take a lot of notes now, so I won't get. Yeah, well, I think, you know, if everybody has the criteria in front of them, when you discuss, we can go through each criteria to see if they meet it. Go through the first one and see if they meet it. And then we can go to the second one. We'll start posing our questions around these criteria. Well, remember, also going to be submitting justification statements as to the work that they've done or going to do, plus how they meet the criteria. Okay. All right. So anyone want to make a motion on v. 2023? I make. Board member. I'll make a motion to approve v. 2023. I'll second. Thank you. Madam. Chair? Aye. Mister Eisler? Aye. Miss Alston? Aye. Motion carries 30. You know, we should have conferred with our final author on these results. Mister Alice. We're good to go, ma'am. Chair? We're good. Our next item is v. 73. Tanya Bayfield. Requests for variances of 12ft lot width and a building line at the building line and 4ft side yard width and a waiver of the parking area location. Require parking area location to validate existing conditions, the lot width at the building line and side yard and obtain a building permit for the proposed driveway in front of the house at 7727 Emerson Road in Hydesville. The record was held open for the petitioner to provide a barrier between the walkway and the driveway. A revised site plan has been submitted. Although the height of the fence was not provided on the site plan, staff will obtain the information from the applicant. Yes, and we have done that. She submitted a revised plan showing that she is putting a fence around the driveway. It's a four foot fence. And we have indicated that the proposed fence is for feet on the site plan. Okay. And it's going up to the house, or is that beyond? No, no, just surrounding the driveway. Because we had a problem with the driveway and the walkway being too close. So we told her that she needed a barrier between the driveway and the walkway. So she just decided to fence in the entire driveway. So on the top, where we have the x's, is that another fence? I think that's the front four foot fence. Let me see. Whose case is this? This is Olga. His name. Oh, Olga. Yeah. Can you put a photograph of the front of the house? Yeah. Because I remember the last time we didn't approve the case because she didn't mention they've hidden off the fence. Right. But there's a. That blue fence is there. So I believe she said that blue fence is coming down, obviously, because you can't drive car through a fence.

She lives with her mother, who has mobility issues, if I remember correctly. Yes, it was her mother. Was she going to. Was she supposed. Did she say she was going to build a ramp or something? I don't think so. I think it was just. She needed the driveway because her mother can't walk if they have to park blocks away. Her mother can't walk that far. That was her justification for the driveway. But it looked like that fence was going all the way around. I don't know if she forgot to take it off or what. I. Like I said, I.

Lot width, 46.96ft. Lot frontage, 3.4% lot coverage and a waiver of the parking area location requirement to validate existing conditions. That's the net lot coverage, net lot area, lot width and lot frontage. And obtain a building permit for the construction of a two story single family dwelling with basement and a circular driveway at eleven three three eight, cross road trail in Brandywine. The record was held open for the petitioner to obtain the site road approved stamp plan. Miss Celeste, did they submit that? They did. It's in the binder. It's on the very last page. Olga, you're on. You're on v 86. We're looking at V 82. You know, we have to start checking site roads. They don't do exactly how we like. 82 23. Oh, I'm getting tired. No, that ship is already sailed, Miss Barbara. It's already sealed. That case came up and I couldn't get the numbers right. I thought I was going crazy. I had some coffee at six, so I'm wide awake. I just warmed up some. No, Miss Alessa, I didn't want any coffee cause I want to go to bed. Well, yeah, I'll pay for it, but I'm awake. Can I share with y'all? I'm two and a half hours beyond bedtime. Oh, you need to give that up. Okay. They did submit, they just recently submitted this, um, site roads. Yes. This was very difficult to get because their original site plan had so many layers on it, you couldn't read anything. Can we make that a little larger please? Okay. The site rotor approval is down at the bottom. Right. Miss Holga, can you make that a little bit bigger, please? Oh, darn. Whoop. We have been having computer problems all day long. Internet problems. Okay, so see is that red down there? The driveway coming in. The driveway comes in and then it circles, goes to the left to the garage and it also goes to the right. They wanted the circular driveway. Yes. So they needed three acres, net lot area 98 97ft lot width 4696ft lot frontage, which is all existing conditions, 3.4% net lot coverage probably due to the driveway. And obtain a building permit for the construction of a two story single family dwelling. So this is a new home. So Mister Watson, will we consider this an infill or was this self inflicted because they bought a small lot? Just a question. Forget it. I don't, you know, I don't believe it's there. It's self inflicted because of. So no, I'm just trying to go by some of these rules I've been reading. If you look at the shape of the lot, it is not within a subdivision. It is like a parcel of land. Is it different from the rest of them? Oh yes. Yeah. Each of them were different. And there's a bunch of trees in between the two. Yes. Yeah. Somebody deemed it buildable to begin with. Yes. And I think they had to deal with the foundation was put in already and so they couldn't shift it to be more centered in the lot, which is why that they're running up against the side yard depth. I'm guessing there is a note there. It says existing 0.67 concrete foundation wall on concrete footers. So they built on an existing. On existing footers. Yeah.

Mister Hawkins? Yes. I would ask the pastor to pray for those residents in Effland, North Carolina. I would do that. That, sir. Thank you. Well, you can please pray for us. Thank you. Wonderful. Thank you. It is indeed an honor to stand here before you this morning to petition a prayer for the work that must be done on today. And it is a privilege to represent the pastors and clergy in the county and the leaders and members of Love AMe Church. Let us pray to God, the creator of the universe, in the name of the higher power in which you believe, the wise and loving one. I come with a heart filled with gratitude and thanksgiving, humbled for this opportunity to come before you on this Thursday morning. On behalf of all who have gathered here, we acknowledge your presence and seek your guidance and direction as the great people who have been elected and appointed to serve the people of this county. And I hope, Lord, that they will come together, unified, and work towards common goals that will move Prince George's county to higher heights as decisions are made to better the lives of all residents of Prince George's county. Leaders have great responsibilities. They must carry heavy loads and wear multiple hats. There will be times of disagreements. But God, we ask that you allow them to come and make the best decisions for all the people in the county and let them remember why they were elected and why they were appointed and why they said yes to serve. I pray, God, that you will let their work become easy and their burdens light. I pray that each member of the council is effective in their work, pure in their intentions, and gracious in their dealings with all people. Oh God, renew their minds and remove any distractions that may lead them away from making the best decisions for all people, and not just for selected few. I pray this morning the agenda and the business of the day will be fruitful. And for the common good and Lord, I ask that we pray for the residents of Effland North Carolina. I ask this prayer in the name of the one that I put my trust in, Jesus the Christ. Amen. Amen. And amen. Amen. Thank you so much. Will now be led in the pledge of allegiance by council member Oreada.

We have one request by the general public to speak. Grant Walker. Good morning, esteemed chair, vice chair and esteemed council members. My name is Grant Walker. I'm the president of the firefighters union here in Prince George county, representing the active and retired members of Prince George county firing ems. For the last four years, our department has suffered from crippling effects of mandatory overtime. The physical health and wellness of our firefighters has been deeply impacted. Our loved ones bear much of that burden, seeing much needed rest and recuperation time canceled at the last minute due to obligations here at work. We're at a critical moment where the resiliency of our workforce and the resources that could lead to the impacts on service delivery. In 2023 and just August in September, our members were forced to work 1068 times for a total of 12,816 hours. Our members have waited for a resolution, and thankfully, today, I think some has come seeing the projected budget that has been put forth on the website. I'm thankful to this council and to our administration for working together to increase the hiring of 150 firefighters. Now, Chief Green said in her budget hearing that we need 251 firefighters. And so I ask that today not be the finish line and that today is just a start. In addressing the historic under staffing of our fire and EMS department. I won't take any more of your time. You have a long day ahead of you. I thank you for all of your support and the hard work that you've been doing on this budget, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come to improve our fire and EMS service here in Pritzke George county.

Next, we have proposed correspondence administrative. Oh, I'm sorry. What did I miss? We should be enacting. Boy, did I miss that. That would be very bad. Is there a motion to suspend the rules? Madam chair? I'd like to ask one of the deputy administrators if we have to suspend the rules. I didn't think so. No, you don't. This is not a day that I'm gonna challenge what's written in front of me, but I will go. I just wanted to. For clarification, I didn't think we needed to suspend the rules. Is that correct? That is correct. You do not need to suspend the rules. Well, first, I will say that CB 45 stands introduced. Thank you, ma'am. And is there a motion to enact? We have a motion by Vice chair Harrison, a second by council member Fisher. Please call the roll. Chair Ivey. Aye. Miss Blaghey, Mister Burrows, in explaining my vote a few months ago, we had a debate around school system construction and the lack of geographical equity that exists. The administration then came at the time and said that they would try to fix it via this budget that has not occurred. As we know, in the first round of p three, there are eight schools. Seven of them are in the north and only one is in in the south. And when you look at traditional IAc method, all the new schools that are coming are in the north and not one in the south. There are no stage renovations that we'd submitted for the south either. And so with that, I'm voting no. Mister Dunoga. Aye. Miss Fisher? I apologize. Aye. I'll come back. Mister Franklin.

Well, let's see. It is afternoon now. Good afternoon. On behalf of my council colleagues, I want to thank each each of you for being here today as we adopted our county's balanced $5.46 billion budget. I also want to thank every Prince Georgian who took the time to engage in our budget process. Your feedback has been invaluable in shaping a spending plan that best serves the needs and demands of our residents. Our budget shortfall this year was $171 million due to factors including including higher interest rates that have hurt home sales and reduced tax income, the ending of federal pandemic funds, rising inflation, the increasing impacts of climate change, and increasing state requirements for education funding. The budget this year and over the next few years is going to be the biggest challenge facing our county. I've compared it to managing a family budget, which many of you, I'm sure, can relate to. As parents, we can't ignore one child's needs over another's, and we're responsible for ensuring needs are met before we start looking at the family's wants. The key word is responsible, and it's a word that's been top of mind as we make financial decisions that at times can be difficult. The shortfall is a considerable obstacle, and it's crucial that we address it with a sense of urgency, creativity, and collaboration, just as we do in our own households. Families have to plan for the future and save for emergencies, and our county needs to also consider long term sustainability. We must continue to ask ourselves, is this a need or is this a want that's vital for us as we prepare to face challenging years ahead? And we're far from alone with other counties across the state, state and country also dealing with budget shortfalls. Despite our challenges, I'm proud to present to you a strategic spending plan that reflects our county's priorities and values and does not compromise on public safety and education. We've been committed to finding solutions that will address the shortfall while minimizing impacts on our citizens. Countless hours of hard work and collaboration have gotten us to this point. I want to personally offer my sincere gratitude to county Executive Angela Oserbrooks and her executive and budget teams, as well as council administrator Jennifer Jenkins and the legislative budget team, including budget director Josh Hamlin and county auditor Tequisa Green. Thank you to chief administrative officer Tara Jackson and budget director Stanley early for their thorough and diligent work. And of course, I want to acknowledge my colleagues on the dais for their teamwork and commitment. Vice chair and district nine council member Sydney Harrison District one council member Tom Durnoga District two councilmember Juanika Fisher, district three councilmember Eric Olson, district four council member Ingrid Watson, district six council member Walla Bligue, district seven council member Crystal Orietta, district eight council member Edward Burroughs and at large council members Mel Franklin and Calvin Hawkins. I'll share now some of our most significant budget enhancements. We've allocated an additional $200,000 to assist the Prince George's police department in filling vacancy agencies. Public safety is top of mind for our citizens and also for the council. We know that we need to hire more police and first responders and make the hiring process more efficient. The county executive's budget already provided funds for 100 new recruits for the police and for the fire departments. The council has negotiated with the executive branch to create an additional 50 firefighter positions. We have the 16th busiest fire department in the US, and it's imperative we support our hardworking women and men who protect our county each day. We've provided an additional $3 million in non departmental grants to help fund our nonprofits. Our nonprofits do indispensable work throughout the county. They depend on this grant money, and we're delivering on that for them. We've also added $100,000 for animal services and the Department of the Environment. Animal services workers and volunteers spoke up at our budget hearings, and while this money won't solve every issue, we want those dedicated employees to know that they were heard. We believe investing in animal services is investing in compassion and community safety. An additional $250,000 will fund a sickle cell machine and equipment at the University of Maryland Capital Region Medical Center. I had the opportunity to tour the Sickle cell unit recently to witness the incredible work happening there and this new state of the art machine will only enhance the quality of care. Out of 5000 sickle cell patients in Maryland, 40% are residents of Prince George's county.

Out of 5000 sickle cell patients in Maryland, 40% are residents of Prince George's county. We've increased funding for warm night shelter support by one point million dollars. We've increased funding for Paygo funding for the bus mass transit, access to capital project to support low no emissions buses and a bus facilities grant program. We've increased operating expenses to provide funding for the cannabis reinvestment and restoration fund by $2 million. We decreased the amount for the next phase of the Maryland National Capitol park and Planning Commission building by $10 million, which brings their final number to be below the original agreement from two years ago. So we thank chair Peter Shapiro for his efforts to get the price down to a better spot. There are a few disappointments. I do have the budget, but it all came down to what we need now versus what I wanted to see. Our library system did not get additional funding and those workers deserve more pay. My stepmom and mother in law were both librarians and I know the critical function they serve for our communities. We also need to hire more people to staff our libraries because we've been building new and bigger libraries, but without the people to staff them, they could end up as beautiful mules. There is a health clinic in the southern part of the county I was hoping to bring more resources to that is severely understaffed, which means fewer people would be tested for hiv. The fair election fund is so important to help people run for office but need financial help to do so, but we couldn't commit funding to it in this budget. As we look ahead, we must focus on building new revenue streams to ensure long term financial health and unburden our residents. Prince George's county has the most undeveloped land in the region and the choices we make about how to utilize this resource will shape the county's future and quality of life for generations to come. I'm committed to working with stakeholders, community members and local businesses to encourage smart growth and transit oriented development. We have much to look forward to with the completion of the Blue Line corridor, relocation of the FBI headquarters, and redevelopment of Hospital Hill. I want again to emphasize the collaboration and collective effort that got us here today. While these may be fiscally challenging times for our county, I know we can emerge stronger and more resilient than ever before. Thank you all for making Prince George's County a place where all proud to call home. And I would just like to remind my colleagues that on Monday it is Memorial Day and we will not be here on Tuesday at 10:00. We have a county council meeting at 10:00. We have committee of the whole at 1130. And a board of health at 130. Do we have district council at 945? I'm sure that is on June 4. Okay? Yes, ma'am. Sorry, I have too many things going on. Okay.

Okay, I will read the constant yield in accordance with the provisions of section 6308 tax property article Annotated Code of Maryland, tonight's public hearing seeks public comments regarding the council's consideration of a proposed real property tax rate increase above the state certified constant yield tax rate for the unincorporated areas of the county and for county municipalities the fiscal year 2025. Constant yield tax rates and proposed real property tax rates are set forth in table one, which is the third attachment to the statement copies of the statement and the corresponding attachments are available for your convenience on the county council's website. And as an attachment to tonight's agenda, the council is considering a real property tax rate of $1 per $100 of assessed valuation in unincorporated areas and for the 60 municipalities showing proposed increases from 85 and five hundredths of hundredths of $0.01 as reflected within the proposed county operating and expense budget submitted by the county executive for fiscal year 2025. The proposed real property tax rate for unincorporated areas of the county is $1, which is unchanged from fiscal year 2024. The real property tax rates for 16 municipalities in the county will increase in fiscal year 2025, with a mean average rate increase of 75 100 of $0.01 for fiscal year 2025. The county is continuing a municipal tax differential as required by state law, and the principal reasons for exceeding the constant yield tax rate in the incorporated areas are according to state law, the county is required to recognize through a lesser county tax rate those governmental services which municipal governments perform in lieu of similar county government services to meet the funding levels of programs set forth in the proposed fiscal year 2025 budget requires an increase above the constant yield rate. The county council will consider and adopt the fiscal year 2025 resolution establishing the tax levies for real and personal property taxes for fiscal year 2025 on Tuesday, June 18, 2024, beginning at 10:00 a.m. i will also give you the proposed fiscal year 2025 multi year contracts pursuant to section 819 of the Prince George's County Charter and subtitle ten of the Prince George's County Code.

Curry administration Building, Largo, Maryland 20774 I want to see if there are any elected officials who have signed up to speak. The mayor of Upper Marlboro, color come on down. Is it working? It's working. So good evening, council chair and council members. It's good to see you and my council members. I am here this evening to ask for your support for, as you know, the Upper Marlboro Economic development funding that has been in the redevelopment authorities budget for the past eight years. We are looking to see some of that funding be allocated to the town of Upper Marlboro in the upcoming fiscal year. The town of Upper Marlboro is 60% of the landmass is non taxable government property. That puts the burden of economic development of downtown Upper Marlboro on the shoulders of 40% of the property owners. As you stated, there's a constant yield tax rate and a municipal differential. So residents of Upper Marlboro are paying 93.4 cents per hundred of assessed value. So that we would like to see some of that come back so that we can actually invest in the economic development of downtown Upper Marlboro and generate more income for the whole county through that approach. So we hope that you will allocate a portion of the $2.5 million in this year and then allocate it out on a reasonable schedule in future years. And we look forward to working together to make Upper Marlboro a great place that is bringing in money for all of us. Thank you. Thank you so much. Sean Heineman and then Seth Grimes. Am I coming through? Yes. Good evening, council chair and council members. My name is Sean Heinemann and I probably serve as language access manager for Ayuda thank you for the opportunity to speak. This evening. I'd like to urge the council to prioritize language access in the fiscal year 2025 budget. Ayuta is a nonprofit dedicated to helping immigrants succeed and thrive in the United States. Since 1973, Ayuda has served more than 150,000 immigrants in the DC metropolitan area. Tonight, I would like to draw your attention to Ayuda's two to one of Ayuda's areas of service, which is language access. For 16 years, Ayuda's community legal interpreter bank, or cLIB, has provided pro bono and public interest lawyers with skilled interpreters at no cost to them, which eliminates the barriers faced by deaf and limited English proficient residents of the DC metropolitan area. Ayuda was awarded a community partnership grant from the county in 2021, and since then, legal service providers have been able to request interpretation and translation services benefiting county residents, facilitating their equal access to the justice system. An estimated 13.9% of this county's residents have limited to no proficiency in English, which is about one in every seven individuals. Language spoken but languages spoken by these Prince Georges Georgians include Spanish, French, French, Haitian Creole, Russian, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Tagalog. There are also an estimated 6000 county residents who are deaf or hard of hearing, many of whom use American Sign language or other sign languages to communicate. Hiuta's interpreter bank boasts over 120 local legally trained professional interpreters continuously ensuring that every client's voice is heard, be it through in person or virtual interpretation. Ayuta also provides translation of critical legal documents enabling immigrants in Prince George's county to fully engage with legal proceedings. Whether it's intake forms, client statements, or vital certificates, these translations are pivotal in the pursuit of justice. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Next.

Seth, come on down. Thank you. Council chair Ivey, council vice chair Harrison and council members. I'm Seth Grimes. I'm with the Washington Area Bicyclist association, which has a network of over 21,000 supporters. Regionally, we envision a just and sustainable transportation system where walking, biking and transit are the best ways to get around. We appreciate the attention and resources that the county has put into an array of pedestrian and bicycle improvements, including funding for the Department of Public Works and Transportation's bicycle network plan projects regarding capital investments. We ask you to sustain and expand bikeways planning, design and construction funding, including build out of the capital trails network in Prince George's county and to allocate capital funds to retrofit road safety improvements per the new standards you directed last year via the Walkable Urban Streets act. Other investments will advance active transportation in Prince George's county, walking, biking and other non motor vehicle modes. In conjunction with strong transit support, we ask you to add Department of Public Works and Transportation design and engineering staff focused on pedestrian safety improvements to implement projects that are in the pipeline that they don't have capacity for at this time, and to add DPW and T resources to apply for federal and state grant funding. We know from direct interaction with DPWNT that they are under resourced in that area. We ask, and this is a conversation I've had with Councilmember Harris, sorry, Burroughs equitable expansion of the bike share network in Prince George's county, including in Fort Washington, where a resident brought this to our attention and creation of an e bike purchase subsidy program that would enable lower income individuals to access that Prince George's must maintain a strong vision zero program at 129 deaths on the county's roads last year. That situation, the road carnage, must be addressed. Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment this evening. Thank you so much. Theresa Dudley I don't see her here, but her name's on the list. Christina Carian and then Patricia Monroe, ladies and gentlemen of the county council, my name is Christina Carrion. I'm a senior volunteer at the shelter and the foster coordinator for Adopt a homeless animal rescue, one of the shelter's rescue partners who has saved almost 200 dogs in the past six years. Today, I stand before you to advocate for a cause that is not only close to my heart as a shelter volunteer and rescue partner, but vital for the well being of the community animal services. As we reflect on the past year, it is evident that our current resources are stretched to their limits and the need for additional funding has never been more urgent. I urge you to continue. Consider the pressing need for a north shelter. The statistics paint a grim future, a grim picture. Year over year, the length of stay for animals in our shelter before being euthanized has been drastically reduced. In 2023 alone, more dogs were euthanized than adopted, a distressing trend that cannot be ignored. Our kennels are consistently at capacity, our staff and volunteers are overwhelmed, and our rescue partners are exhausted. It's clear that we cannot simply rely on rescue, foster and adoption efforts to address the crisis. We need another facility to accommodate the growing numbers of animals in need of shelter and care. Currently, our shelter operates with 170 dog kennels with a goal of maintaining an 85% capacity rate. However, this model is simply not sustainable. As the demand for animal services continues to rise, we are at a breaking point where we are unable to adequately provide for animals in our care. With the recent health issues and shutdowns, it doesn't bode well for the dogs in the shelter. It is imperative that we take action now to address this crisis before it escalates further. I implore you to reconsider our budget allocation for animal services. We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the suffering of our community's animals who are depend who depend on us. By investing in a north shelter, supporting provisional, aggressive policies and ensuring adequate resources for existing facilities, we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of animals in our community. In conclusion, I urge you to pass the funding necessary to address the urgent needs of our animal services. Together, we have the power to create a future where every animal is valued, cared for and given a chance to thrive. Thank you so much, Miss Carian. Next, Patricia Monroe.

Then Susan misleading good evening members of the county council. My name is Patricia Monroe, president of the South Lawn Citizens association with a demographics for young people has drastically changed. I am here this evening to speak about the $40 million the county would like to spend on a building for parking planning. Currently, only 25% of the parking planning staff have returned to the office. EOB was recently renovated, not to mention the office space that is located at 6611 Kenilworth Avenue and Walker Drive. All are very close to this admin building. I think that that money could be better spent on activities and mentoring programs for our youth. How did you stay out of trouble? Back in the day, there were programs, villages, activities in every neighborhood. Recently, I had a conversation with a few members of our community engagement officers on ways to keep the youth off the streets and busy. Many of our youth do not have access to recreational activities, mentoring or skill development programs. Maybe the money can be used for year round internship training programs, something that is positive. Young people learn teamwork, communication and conflict resolution when interacting with their peers, and it boosts their self esteem. There is a great link between idle youth and troubled social behavior, including drug abuse and violence. When I asked a young person why things are like they are, I was told in this verbatim, if we had things to do, we wouldn't be having all this time to be killing each other. We have too much time here. Gangs and drugs keep us busy. That was verbatim, a lack of access to well resourced and well managed activities has intentionally or unintentionally influenced the issue of violence. I urge the county council to take a real look at what is happening with our young people today and consider putting that $40 million towards something that will make the county better for all of us. Hello council chair and council members. My name is Susie Misla, a resident of Cheverly for 29 years. I'm here as a representative of the Prince George's County Library system. Tonight, I'm asking you to grant the request made by the library a fund enhancement for a required classification study and the contractually obligated wage increase. This is about a classification study that ensures that PGCMOS employee duties and wages are comparable with those of other local public library systems. We're required to take this classification certification study, undertake it, and it matters. It matters because of the services we provide. And you can't provide services without staff, and you can't keep staff who are qualified and enthusiastic if they're not getting paid commensurate with other systems. So briefly, library cards. A library card will get a person into a computer, to use a computer to apply for jobs. Kids are learning to do their homework. Some of them don't have access to Wi Fi, to Internet at home. And the library provides that. You don't have to pay anything or even have the library card to walk in the door, to use the study rooms and to use the. And to attend movie screenings and book discussions and ESL classes. We have conversation clubs that allow people to begin to enable themselves to engage in the community. Thank you so much. Appreciate you. And people are lonely. They really need a place to go. You know what? That is a fact. Michael Jones and Christopher Demarco and then Shannon Mooton and Tina Curry. No, Shannon Mooton. Good evening, council chair and council members. I am still Shannon Mouton, executive director for Lars Laurel advocacy and referral services, and on behalf of our board of directors, staff and clients. Thank you for your continued support of our vision, mission and programs. I am here this evening to request a grant for $175,000 for this upcoming fiscal year. For 37 years, Laura's has provided food and financial support to low income and homeless individuals and families of Laurel, Maryland. And that is about to change for the first time in our 37 year history, Lars is moving out of Laurel. While we will continue to serve the residents of Laurel, the city of and the unincorporated parts, we are expanding south and west. We are moving into the first, further into the first district, as well as in districts two, district three, district four, and district five, specifically the municipalities of Belgium, Beltsville, Adelphi, Hyattsville, New Carrollton, Greenbelt and Bladensburg. We will have clients from our emergency services program, permanent supportive housing program and self sufficiency program. LArs is ready to serve wherever the need exists. We at Lars look forward to meeting with, engaging with, and partnering with, and serving in our expanded circle of neighbors. The $175,000 grant will be used to continue to provide support to the municipalities I stated. Thank you for your time and for considering our request. Thank you.

So please support the quality of life projects because they make big difference and they help to bring in tax base to fund all of the other stuff. Thank you. Thank you. April Gower getz then miss Amy Pragoski, and then Vanessa Davis. Good evening. I'm April Garagetz, the executive director for the Prince George's Provider Council, a membership organization of more than 30 agencies providing services and supports for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Prince George's county. I'm here tonight representing our member agencies and the more than 2500 support professionals who provide services to more than 2000 Prince Georgians who live with intellectual and developmental disabilities. We want to thank you for your support and for including the DSP county supplement into the upcoming fiscal year's budget. When we met with many of our council members this year, we asked for an increase in the supplement from 4.6 million to 5 million. We certainly have a better appreciation for budget challenges and we understand if that is not possible. Direct support professionals are essential to the daily lives of print Georgians who live with intellectual and developmental disabilities. They are the community's caregivers, clinicians, job coaches, educators and more. Yet most earned a wage lower than what can be earned at such places. At target are Wegmans. The DSP county supplement helps us to supplement the wages paid to these essential frontline workers, helping to increase retention and encourage others to enter this crucial field of work. Last year at this time, our membership reported more than 400 direct support staff vacancies. However, with the help of last year's DSP county supplement, the vacancy rate decreased from 25% to 18%. Current vacancies, unfortunately, continue to impact the ability for county residents to obtain services they need. The county's DSP supplement will help us stabilize the workforce and address quality of life issues for some of the most vulnerable citizens, the more than 2000 Prince Georgians who live with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Once again, thank you for including the DSP supplement in the fiscal year 25 budget. Thank you. Amy Pragoski Vanessa Davis good evening. My name is Amy Piergoski. I'm a district one homeowner and a volunteer at the county animal shelter. At the DoE budget work session last week, the director was asked about the high turnover and staffing issue at the shelter. She replied that the shelter is now a, quote, better place to work. I respectfully disagree. I have never seen morale lower from volunteers, rescues and staff. With so many animals being euthanized weekly in overall conditions. These are my top three issues that additional funding can help with. First, staffing. So many vacant positions aren't posted for months. We've been without a foster coordinator since last year. There are still vacancies for the animal control officer positions, and the new hours for staff means that care attendants now leave at 630, which means the animals are alone and unattended for about 414 hours. The county would also benefit by hiring a full time behaviorist to ensure the animals are getting daily enrichment and walks. Behavior evals were stopped in February 2023, so there's no system in place for assessing which dogs are most adoptable. Volunteers do write most of the comments on the dogs you see on the website. Second, community outreach. The county needs to be more proactive instead of reactive when it comes to engaging with the public regarding animal care. The public needs to be better educated on what it means to be a response. Responsible pet parent just look at the number of strays coming into our shelter. County council members often send out mailers about upcoming activities or programs. Please consider sending out mailers reminding folks about the leash laws, the importance of spay, neuter microchipping and vaccines. Let's go to the areas with the most strays and offer a microchip clinic. Many residents still don't know where the shelter is, have an open house to give a tour of the shelter, talk about animal care, and the volunteers will be more than happy to help with that. Finally, building maintenance. Recently, there was a mandate that came down that the dogs could no longer have blankets or toys in their kennels.

The drains will fix the drains. Don't punish the dogs. A karanda bed isn't enough for many dogs, like seniors and emaciated dogs, they need soft bedding.

No other area of county government solves its problems by terminating lives. Yet that's what happens every week at the shelter. Thank you, Miss Piergoski. Vanessa Davis and then Darlene Reyes. My name is Vanessa Davis. I am a homeowner in district eight as well as a senior volunteer at the PG county animal shelter. I am here to advocate for additional funding for more staffing. My goal every Sunday is to get every walkable dog in the building out for at least five minutes, but preferably ten to 15 minutes. Hence my t shirt. Most animals do not like to go to the bathroom where they sleep, and for many of them, they try to hold it, and this could lead to medical issues. I also feel this helps them de stress, even if they just for a little bit. If you have spent any time in animal shelters, especially one of this size, it is very loud and chaotic. The caretakers currently on staff are. Ma'am, I know you're trying to get through it, but we have an interpreter who can't keep up with you. Well, we're trying, but we were told three minutes and now we've been cut to two. So we're, like, really trying to consolidate what we had. Yeah, we're getting the message, but go ahead. Okay. The caretakers currently on staff are responsible for up to 160 dogs, 90 cats and other small animals. They are working to keep the kennels and living spaces clean and therefore do not have time to get the job. Dogs out on a daily basis. The SPCA has donated a large play yard along with the smaller pens, but this is not enough. Adequate enclosed outdoor space for the number of dogs at this facility and the smaller pens have rocks instead of grass, and the dogs don't generally like that. And then they're also being used by staff to hold the dogs while the animals are being cleaned, so we can't use them. There's plenty of open space to get a new play yard installed. Many of the large breeds and working dogs are there for a month or more. They need to be able to get fresh air and stretch their legs to help avoid overall kennel stress at this time so that more staff can be present during the day, the animals are being left alone for 13 plus hours. This leaves well over 250 animals with no one to observe them if they happen to have a medical emergency, which very well may be the case given how much sickness has been at the facility recently. And last night there was a medical case. The dog was having severe medical issues and he was not able to be sent out to a vet. I believe if there were more funding in the budget, he may have been able to get the medical care he needed, or at least perhaps a veterinary on call that could have, like, we could have videotaped and showed what the animal was going through. These animals are the responsibility of the county, and the way we treat them is reflected in our reputation by our county residents as well as other surrounding counties. The reputation is not great right now based on, on what we are seeing on social media. Lastly, I would like to have a fund set aside to help with low cost adoption so that we do not give these animals away for free. They are living, breeding animals that have already been neglected by their owners. Thank you, Miss Davis. Or by being able to plant large, and their lives are important. Next we have Darlene Reyes, then Leah Schuller. All right. Hello. Good evening, esteemed council members. My name is Darlene Reyes, and I am the librarian three for the Prince George's County Memorial Library system. A longtime resident of Prince George's county and currently residing in Beltsville, I want to start off by thanking you all, first and foremost for your time, the support that you have given our system thus far, and for giving me the opportunity to speak with you today. This year will be my 7th year working at Prince Georgia county. It's been a rewarding time working in a place that had such an impact in my life. In high school, I distinctly remember going to library several times and having spanish speaking customers tap me on the shoulder and say in soft spoken voices, excuse me. They'd ask me, a child, a complete stranger, if they filled out their form correctly, or if I could show them how to print, and of course I helped. So when I decided to become a librarian, it felt like a peace falling into place. And since then I've continued to help my community in any way I can. I've seen people with differing levels of frustration and anxiousness, and it makes sense.

I've seen people with differing levels of frustration and anxiousness, and it makes sense. In a world full of technology, it's so easy to think that it just simplifies our lives without considering how people might be falling behind. So I ask that you keep in mind that at less than 1% of the county budget, funding for PTC MLS is small but valuable investment to the lifelong learning of Prince Georgians. We appreciate the county's support for our services and we have some amazing programs like job fairs and english classes. And the library system is filled with people that care about their PG communities. So do we want them to work elsewhere? With this in mind, I would like to ask that you help fund the enhancement request for required classifications study at an estimated cost of $159,000 and the contractually obligated wage increase. It's necessary to ensure that PGCMLs employee duties and wages are comparable to those of other local public libraries and that you also consider funding contractually obligated compensation for library employees. Thank you. Good evening ladies and gentlemen at the county council. My name is Leah Schuller. I am a district four homeowner, a senior shelter volunteer and a rescue partner with Love Paws Rescue. I am here to ask for more shelter funding from my rescue partner side we have spent $60,000 on dogs from PG shelter since last June. Nearly 30,000 was spent on ER and special care for animals that did not receive enough medical intervention at the shelter whose medical issues were not properly diagnosed. Liam and wiggles were two puppies laying on desk door at the shelter last fall in severe respiratory distress. We rushed them to the ER. They cost us $12,000 in ER bills alone. Booker or Wattweiler was also in severe respiratory distress this spring and died as soon as he got to the ER. He cost us $1,200 ER bills. Sammy is going to cost us over $10,000 in vet bills as we process with surgery for his neurological problems that went undiagnosed at the shelter. We operated at a loss last year because the animals with strep show we took in. We couldn't let them languish on the shelter floor. We incurred large ER vet bills for pitties and other dogs we pulled since strep show and other serious medical issues since January and are still operating. Operating at a loss. It's unsustainable to support the animals and the shelter. The way things are going, the shelter needs more funding to be able to do better for the animals and to make it more sustainable for rescue, to keep rescuing shelter animals with more resources. On my shelter volunteer side, almost half of the dogs and the shelter are victims of BSL. The laws are not working and are forcing responsible pet guardians and businesses to not want to move to Prince George's county. Not only are we losing good people and businesses, this is causing the shelter to regularly approach capacity. Thank you. Thank you very much, Miss Nicol, and I believe that that reaches the end of our speakers list. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, sorry. Kelly Nickel, I apologize. Go ahead, Kelly. Not a problem. Thank you, council chair Ivey and council members, for the opportunity to speak on the need for increased funding for the animal services division. I am a senior volunteer at the animal shelter and adoption counselor for Layla's legacy animal rescue and in my professional life I work on federal healthcare policies. I am here to speak to the urgent need for physical and behavioral veterinary care in the shelter to implement minimum standards of care that impact the well being of the animals and care at the staff and public goods. First and foremost, the shelter needs a full time on site veterinarian. Throughout the last year, the shelter has faced repeated upper respiratory illness outbreaks of considerable epidemiological concern. I've observed veterinary exams occur from outside an animal's kennel without any handling of the animal identification of an upper respiratory illness. The severity of any illness or pain cannot be properly evaluated or diagnosed through obstructed view of a kennel door without physical interaction of the animal. This leaves many dogs suffering frequently under treated. A veterinarian is sorely needed as well as protocols for staff who are left with few options to handle these issues, particularly during off hours. At this time, the shelter has lacked the proper medication. At times, the shelter has lacked the proper medication to treat sick dogs. Research indicates that severe respiratory illness should be treated with a combination of medications, which is currently not done at the shelter, despite the number of dogs dying or being euthanized for illness. At the same time, the FDA indicated only five animal drugs should shortages in the last year, none of which have been for an antibiotic. Any shortage that shelter has experienced is artificial and attributable only to poor management and sourcing.

Equally problematic is the lack of behavioral health care. Currently, there is not a single dedicated staff member with expertise or training making euthanasia decisions incredibly arbitrary. It also means that they suffer endlessly until they reach this fate. Because behavioral medications are not administered, shelter staff are not immune to this. They experience compassion fatigue that perpetuates poor medical care within the facility. The best treatment is prevention.

This is the county council of Prince George's county. Today is Tuesday, May 9, 2024. Madam Clerk, please call the roll. Good afternoon, chair. Ivy. Here. Miss Boogan? Present. Mister Burroughs. Present. Present. I think you said my name, so. Present, sir. Franklin? Here. Mister Harrison? Present. Mister Olson? Here. Mister weirdo? Here. Miss Watson. You're muted, Miss Watson, but we have ten members present. Can you hear me now? Yes, we can. Okay. Present. We have proposed correspondence and administrative officers report. It's a proposed letter of support for WSSC. Spoke federal funding application for the western branch Sewer rehabilitation project that is centered around District Heights. I would like to ask Kenny battle to please give us an overview. Thank you, madam chair, members of the council. So we are here today at the request of WSSC and their efforts to secure a federal earmark for water sewer rehab project that is in the district Heights and Forsville area. Now, this project is part of the WSSC CIP. There's a by county project that's entitled Sewer Trunk Sewer Rehab program, but there's an opportunity to get this earmarked for this specific project. And so the deal is, the deadline for the letter is tomorrow. Okay. And so what we're trying to do, one of the requirements is to get letter of support. And so they brought it to us. We're trying to accommodate their request. This letter describes the project briefly and talks about some of the problems that are in that area. It's an environmentally sensitive area as well, and that's one of the reasons why it's qualifying for this earmark. So the letter describes the project and, you know, indicates the council's support. The commission actually asked to add another sentence, if possible, just to describe the kind of work that's going to be for the project. But bottom line is we have WSSC staff here. Miss Monica Marquina is the government affairs director. We have Patricia von Brainbridge, who is a sewer infrastructure manager, and Ayula Adioye. And I hope I said that correctly, who is the project manager? And so, madam chair, that concludes my summary. And the idea here is to authorize the chair to sign off on the letter of support. Right. Miss Marquina, would you like to make any remarks? Yes. Thank you so much. Good afternoon, chair Ivy, vice chair Harrison, and council members, for the record, my name is Monica Marquina, director of government affairs for WCC Water. On behalf of GM Pisha Powell, I wanted to sincerely thank all of you for agreeing for this very last minute special meeting. To support a very important project for WCC water. We are extremely grateful. And with me today, as Mister Battle mentioned, we have Patricia Vaughn Rambridge here to answer questions, as well as Ayula Adeyoye, project manager. WCC water remains laser focused on identifying external funding opportunities. We are pleased to share that Congressman Mister Glenn Ivey has agreed to submit a congressional earmark on behalf of WCC water for the Reston Branch Sewer District Heights reconstruction replacement project. Thats a mouthful. The earmark is through the state and Tribal Assistance grant program through the Environmental Protective Agency. These grants fund local wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. The estimated cost for this project is $8.2 million in FY 23. Most stag infrastructure projects funded in the range of $445,000 to up to $5 million. With that, I will turn it over to our subject matter experts who can provide a very brief overview of the project and answer any questions you may have. And thank you in advance. Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I'm Patricia Vaughan Brainbridge, and I would like to share my screen. Not too soon. Who needs to give me that permission? It says the host disabled participants.

I apologize. I just want to note that Mister Franklin is on virtual with us just to make everybody sure everybody knows that. Thank you for joining us Mister Franklin, Miss Hightower. Good morning Chair Dunoga, chair Ivey and members of the PHED committee today were going to start with the Department of Housing and Community Development overview for their budget. I would like to first turn to Miss Shailene Miller y to give a budget overview. Thank you. Good morning chair Dunoga, vice chair Ivy as well as members of the the PhD committee. For the record, my name is Shailen Miller Y and I'm with the budget and policy analyst division. I will be providing you with an overview of the Department of Housing and Community Development. I want to thank DHCD and OMB for the information they provided included in this report. All information will be summarized and further details can be found in the report and the responses. The fiscal year 2025 budget for DHCD is 142,545,000 in 200, an increase of 12,536,000 in 300 or 9.6% from fiscal year 2024. This is mainly due to the increase in operational costs for the workforce, housing gap financing program projects and the Housing Investment Trust Fund. The proposed general fund is 5 million. The proposed general funding fund is 5,687,700, a 2.8% decrease. The proposed grant fund is 108,000,779 79 7739 thousand 200, an increase of 247,700 or 0.2%. The proposed special revenue fund is 28,000,011 18,000 in 300, an increase of 12,452,000 in 400 or 79% over the fiscal year 2024 approved amount. In terms of staffing, DACD has a nutrition rate of 8.9% due to retirees and strain on staff due to increased responsibilities. There are no proposed changes to the current 121 staff count. However, there are six vacancies, two from the general fund, three from the grant fund and one from the special Revenue fund. Two grant positions, including community developer positions are currently unfunded. Strictly related to the general fund once again, the proposed budget is approximately 5.6 million. 1.6 million is for the administration division with a 15,501% increase 2.2 million for the housing community development division with a decrease of 229,600, or 9.3% below fiscal year 2024 and lastly the redevelopment division which increased by $50,300 for or 2.8% from fiscal year 2024. There were no staff changes from the general fund, but DHCD has mentioned that the accounting positions are most affected by attrition. The fringe benefits are proposed at 3,634,000. A historical trend of fringe benefits can be found on page three of the report. Operating expenses for the general fund are proposed at $890,000 200, a 271,000 300,000 increase or 23.4% decrease due to the removal of consulting contracts related to the consolidated plan, the comprehensive housing strategy, their affordable housing dashboard, and housing fair. Moving on to the grant fund which is proposed at approximately 9.8 million, a decrease of 218,000 or 2.2% from fiscal year 2024. This decrease is due to the reduction of the Home Investment Partnership program. Grants include the Community Development Block grant, the Emergency Solutions grant, the Home Investments Partnership and program income includes the Home Loan, the Maryland National Mortgage Settlement Neighborhood Conservation Initiative, Neighborhood Stabilization Program, Home and the Neighbor Stabilization Program. There are no notable staff count changes, but one limited grant funded position for pathways to purchase was removed to add a limited grant fund position to the ESG program. Compensation is proposed at 910,000, a $179,000 decrease from fiscal year 2024. Operational is proposed at 8.6 million, a decrease of 668,300, once again due to the reduction of the Home Investment Partnerships program. Some highlights of the grant fund can be found on pages five and six of the report, but notably, the ESG program distributed approximately 4 million of ERA funds in fiscal year 2024 and will allocate all funds by the end of 2024. The CDBG program has announced three notices of funding availability for shovel ready public service projects and helped close out eleven projects.

DACD has also expressed two nonprofits are administering HVAP and hop funds, and one last thing to note is that DHCD has issued letters of support for three projects totaling 4.5 million with home ArP funds on page seven of the report. A chart of all grants by division is also available in terms of the Housing Investment Trust fund. It is proposed at 28.1 million, a 12.4 million, or 81% increase from fiscal year 2024 due to the reappropriation of committed funds for delayed projects. In terms of staffing, one vacancy will be filled by the end of fiscal year 2024 and one position was reallocated from a short term grant funding position to a full time position in fiscal year 2024. For the calendar year of 2020, 314 projects were in the LiHTC application phase and committed funds from the Housing Investment Trust fund. Five projects were awaiting financing from the state and this is all detailed on page nine of the report. Through two charts showing projects under construction and projects, DACD has provided support letters. In fiscal year 2025, DAC plans to continue supporting the community county's affordable housing production goals through the notice of funding process with home ARP Housing Investment Trust fund and pilots. They also plan to preserve affordable housing with the right of first refusal program and support enhance the pathways to purchase program as well as strengthen the impact of the CDBG program. The few concerns that they have current, they have noted are the current undisbursed grant funds, which as of March 13, 2024, were 10.1 million. They must expend 2.2 million by May 2 to meet their timeliness test. Other concerns include Maryland ZHCD's backlog, which is delaying affordable housing projects, but they are monitoring the progress of county priority projects. Other challenges they noted are non responsiveness through ERAP and landlord unwilling landlords unwillingness to participate in e wrap, as well as the lack of affordable single family housing available to increase home ownership with the pathways to purchase program. Thank you and please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you, Miss Miller. Y. Any questions? Sure. Why are landlords unwilling to sue to be involved with the ERAP program? So we do see a lot of households who have already taken the opportunity to receive ERP in the past been unable to continue paying their rent. So landlords who have gone through this process before are unwilling to continue because at this point, really the issue is the a household who really cannot afford the house they have. So Iraq is meant to be a point in time, and it's not meant to be. It has that time. So we see a lot of tension because of the ongoing need. And how much do we have still available for renters? I have all of that in the presentation, but would you like me to go through. We still have available funds right now. Yeah. I'm very curious. Yeah. So. Okay, well, we'll wait for the presentation I meant questions of Miss Miller. Why? But you can ask questions. Anyone you want. No, please, mister early. Any additional comments? No additional comments at this time and I think whatever I might say probably is covered by the presentation anyway. Great. In that case, we'll turn to miss Apolia for her presentation. Welcome. Great. It's great to be with you today. So we have put together some slides to clarify a little bit the numbers because some of the reporting you've heard includes all the agencies, housing authority, RDA and DHCD. So we are isolating our information and hopefully answering some of those questions. So you know who we are. We are not a forward facing agency. A lot of our programs is really working in partnership with mission driven nonprofit and for profit developers to increase quality affordable housing in the county and support the county's equitable economic development growth. And this is how we are organized. This is the dhed style staff only team and we do currently have two vacancies, both of which are under the process of getting filled. So we will be fully staffed the next few months and we are a team of 31. I just want to put it out there because we heard the bigger numbers, but a lot of that was staff from the housing authority and staff from the RDA. And that is how the DHD budget looks like. And I want to be clear on the general funds on the 5.687 that you see. That includes also operating costs and staff salaries for the RDA. And then the balance of that is for Dhed staff. And the programs we use are entitlement funds and the Housing Investment Trust fund that you see there that support our projects.

I just want to put it out there because we heard the bigger numbers, but a lot of that was staff from the housing authority and staff from the RDA. And that is how the DHD budget looks like. And I want to be clear on the general funds on the 5.687 that you see. That includes also operating costs and staff salaries for the RDA. And then the balance of that is for Dhed staff. And the programs we use are entitlement funds and the Housing Investment Trust fund that you see there that support our projects. One small caveat that it is a detail, but I want to be clear is that for fiscal year 25, entitlement funds, the 9.8, that is an estimate we haven't heard yet from HUD. They announce a little later in the year. As soon as they do announce, we update you all on that and you will see all of this in our annual action plan. So core programs that our department launches and supports are production of affordable housing, both rental and home ownership, and also addressing critical repair needs of existing homeowners and of course our community development program. So how do we use our housing investment trust fund and home fund to support this? We issue a notice of funding availability once a year and we try to time this around the state's notice of funding availability and we outline the county priorities. So we make it very clear that supporting ToD projects around the blue line, purple line and all the transit stations are a priority prioritizing projects that are delivering some units that are below 50% of area median income, and of course, adhering to green standards and energy efficiency, among other things, and a little bit of how the whole process works, because that will help us clarify why there is money that hasn't been drawn, but also has has been committed. So we issue the NOFA and we review the projects that come on our way for a few things. One is, do they meet the county priorities? And two, are they leveraging other public and private resources? And based on that, we issue soft lois, at that point, that is not a commitment, that is just an intent to support, contingent to council approval and contingent to funding availability. But we have done the initial screening of making sure that those projects are our maiden county priorities. And this is a letter that the developers need in order to continue securing other public and private funding. So the next thing they do is they go through the state's routes and they seek tax credits and other subordinate debt, and they also go to the private market to secure the investment. And once they have done this, and there is proof that there is a commitment of all these other resources that are needed, because our resources are a small part, they're an important part. They're this last but four part, but they are not a part that on its own can deliver these projects. So they come back to us with proof that this project, that they have secured the other funding, and then we bring the projects in front of you, and then is when we actually do a firm commitment. So I know we're going to be coming in front of you next week for a couple of projects. And this is because we have already done all these steps and they have demonstrated that they have secured the other resources. And after you approve the project, they continue working with us, but also with all the other public and private lenders through this closing process. And sometimes it can be very quick and sometimes it can take a very long time, depending on how the other public and private lenders move and what questions they may have. And then construction starts, and it can last anywhere between 18 to 24 months. So this is to say that from step one to a delivery of the project, it can be a five, seven year period, maybe three if you are like it. But I have never seen that. So it is important, I think what I wanted to explain on this, that it is very important that we do have this predictable housing investment trust fund because it allows us to create this pipeline. So we are now at this point where the county has a pipeline of projects that can be supported from the state. And so what happened specifically, in fiscal year 24, we have currently 752 units under construction. So we will see those delivered in the next fiscal year. We completed 800 units and we have 925 units in the pipeline, meaning they should start construction anywhere between next month and the next few months, contingent to all the lenders coming together. And also this fiscal year, we have continued with the success of the riot first refusal program and have preserved an additional 492 units, NOAA units that are now committed, affordable units in the county. And that is to say that to date we have preserved over 1800 affordable housing units. And what is important, what we always want to drive home with the right of first refusal program, is that this is really preserving home for the workforce, like looking at the income of people who are actually able to stay in their homes. And as we are doing this program, we're also looking at the needs of the property. So we are addressing deferred maintenance and capital improvements, needs that are needed through our tools, through our pilots and our investments. And then on the homeownership side, we have our pathway to purchase that. We're working very closely with the RDA. We did make changes last year that we talked about. We increased the contribution to 25,000 on our end, and we have seen a spike in the activity because of that. But we are monitoring very closely because with the interest rates, the market is volatile and what happens on that. And one of the things, feedback we've heard is that typically when you are in one of those homes that are accessible to a first time home buyer and you are looking to graduate to your bigger home, your first home becomes available.

But now with the increased interest rates, people are not looking at this bigger opportunity. So there is less inventory of houses that could meet the first home buyers needs. So we're looking closely on what other changes we may need to, and we're working closely with the state on that. The hrap and the hop program are ongoing programs. Great success. The Hop program is the program that because of your support, we were able to launch 18 months ago, approximately with ARPA funds. And now we continue funding into housing investment trust fund. So we work with heap and habitat in these efforts. And one thing we started last year, and I think that was, again, feedback both from the council and the administration, we launched home maintenance workshops, which are now mandatory for everybody who takes advantage of our programs. But they are also open to everybody, so they happen every two months. It's a partnership between hip and Habitat, and they cover a series of home maintenance needs. Also, we launched last year a faith based initiative, and through a big RFP process we are now working through enterprise with seven houses of worship in helping them think through how they can develop their land to affordable home ownership. So we're helping them with technical assistance, with due diligence, so they can graduate to the level where they are ready to bring in front of us projects. And like the previous years, we update our dashboard now quarterly. So after this legislative session, we will update it again to show what projects we have in the pipeline. So real time, anytime someone wants to see what has been completed, what is under construction, this is available in our dashboard. And for projects in the pipeline, we explicitly include only projects that have received council approval because at that point there is a firm commitment and we know that they are going to be moving to closing community development. I think it was mentioned earlier. So the great news is that this year we already met our timeliness test ahead of time, so we're waiting for Huds confirmation on May 2. It is because of a lot of work that happened on our end. We did work very closely, closely with some organizations that had a hard time delivering and providing biweekly technical assistance, and we also had a lot of support from the council in reprogramming. So I want to thank you very much for your partnership in addressing something that has been an ongoing issue. But because of all of these things, we are in a position to actually be deploying funds. So that is, at the end of the day, the good news, and that is about Iraq. So besides the big organizational chart that you saw about our team, we have been running a parallel branch of our ERAP team that includes temporary staff and also part time DHD staff. So we have twelve full time temporary staff getting paid from IRAP admin, and some of our team continues to do double duty in terms of compliance accounting. There are certain things we cannot add outsourced for different purposes. So where we are today is that era one has been fully deployed. And as you saw probably in the news, we did reopen the portal a few weeks ago and we're getting ready to announce that we're going to be closing it again. Because right now all the applications that we have received are enough to pretty much take away that funding, but for a couple of million dollars that we are able to redirect from the administrative costs to direct payment. So even after we fully close the portal for everybody, we will be able to take applications in for people facing evictions, prioritizing those that are below 50%, and that was because of the cost savings on the administrative costs. So we will continue in fiscal year 24 to selectively provide that assistance. A couple of other things that we did this year and we're going to intensify next year, is we are revamping our loan servicing and compliance teams, both by adding staff and also creating new policies and procedures. And this is because, as you saw, there is a big pipeline of projects that we didn't have before. So we see our responsibility as being stewards of the public resources in the long run, both on the compliance side but also on the repayment side. So these are new functions within the department that are getting intensified and you will hear much more about this the next few months. We did launch our next five year consolidated plan effort. This is something we have to do every five years. And you see then the annual plans coming in front of you. So there will be a lot of market analysis and data analysis, but also a lot of community input in terms of bringing this plan forward. And we will be in front of you multiple times, but eventually in Q one of 25 in submitting that plan. So this is what I had. So I'm happy to take more questions. Thank you so much. Questions for Miss Napoleon. Yes, Miss Ivy, back to erap. Okay. So we do get calls from people who still need help.

Questions for Miss Napoleon. Yes, Miss Ivy, back to erap. Okay. So we do get calls from people who still need help. And you know, what you're saying is really important that sometimes you help people and they still aren't going to be able to afford the place long term. And of course, the county would have to do things differently and of course, cost a lot more to help everybody who is having problems with affordability. So I'm wondering, what can we do for people? I mean, there's a constituent that I have, he's been contacting us constantly about needing help. He's a single dad. He's got three kids. He's got a lot of problems. And we have helped him. We've helped him. Bladensburg's helped him, like, everybody who we could tap into has helped him. But he's reached a point where he's kind of run out of funds and he's run out of organizations that are willing to keep putting money into what you start to feel like as a black hole. He's not going to be able to afford that apartment. So what can we do for people like that to help them move into something that is less expensive? So, yeah, that would be. So this is the $1 million question. And I have a 5ft answer for you and a 10,000ft answer for you. The 5ft answer is that we can rehouse them. IRAP allows us to rehouse. So a lot of times we look at someone's situation and when it's evident. Right. So we cannot force people to move if that is their choice and that is what they're working with their landlord. Right. So now the thing is we can, we provide security deposit and up to three months for housing. So you should stay still, send them our way. We are still having the call center and we still look at each case uniquely. Thank you. That's really helpful. And just generally speaking, what is the situation that you're finding with people kind of post Covid? We see all kinds of things. Some people have moved to new jobs and actually are not even income eligible anymore, which, but they are also not able to avoid to pay rent. And that really tells you of what housing crisis we have. And that is not a unique conversation in Prince George's County. I do want to put that in perspective because we are in regional meetings and national calls. What we see here, we see it everywhere in the housing and I think the housing supply, unless we, we really meaningfully address housing supply for people of all incomes, we will never move beyond that nationally. And what would you say the numbers are that we should be shooting for in Prince George's county if we're supposed to make a difference so that people can afford where they live? We're following the regional numbers. I think there was a huge discussion very recently with urban and hunt. So the regional numbers that the council of Governments has put out there about the housing in the region are a roadmap because they have taken into account growth patterns that all the planning departments in all jurisdictions have provided. And so there are the 19,000 by 2030 affordable units. And that's why we are having our dashboard and trying to create a robust pipeline and also complete. And are we considering how many of those units should be in multifamily and how many should be single family and how many should be townhomes or whatever? Yeah, we haven't come down to making that specific determination as a department because that's a bigger land use decision. But everybody in the region who has been able to make a lot of progress towards affordable housing production goals has intensified also their multifamily production. Because these are a lot of units, it's impossible to deliver this many units, just a single homes or just as townhouses. But it is important to continue building our inventory of affordable home ownership. Right. Because we want to have options. So, but we haven't come down to say this many of that and this of that. Okay, I'll let somebody else ask questions, but I still have some. Okay. Wasn't an number of regional housing units 75,000 or 50,000? Not by 2030, but over the next period of time. How much? 75% of which would be afforded regionally because CoG put out numbers. Maybe Mister Berlaz remembers this because we've had presentations. It was a very large number that they wanted regionally. They wanted 75% of them at high capacity rail stations, which I don't think we're, you know, I don't think we're being successful on our share, Mister Olsen. It was just a lens all the way from Loudoun county down to every county in this jurisdiction. The regional goal from council of governments was like 329,000. I know it's a lot, and I would say some jurisdictions are meeting that and actually exceeding their targets. And we are making significant progress, but we haven't met it yet. Mister Olson, do you have your hand up? Yes, thank you very much. Question about the housing investment trust fund. The source of that funding is that. Am I correct that that's from development fees? That are the development fees that go into the legislation that you all passed. That was 20% and definitely no less than 10 million per year. So.

They wanted 75% of them at high capacity rail stations, which I don't think we're, you know, I don't think we're being successful on our share, Mister Olsen. It was just a lens all the way from Loudoun county down to every county in this jurisdiction. The regional goal from council of governments was like 329,000. I know it's a lot, and I would say some jurisdictions are meeting that and actually exceeding their targets. And we are making significant progress, but we haven't met it yet. Mister Olson, do you have your hand up? Yes, thank you very much. Question about the housing investment trust fund. The source of that funding is that. Am I correct that that's from development fees? That are the development fees that go into the legislation that you all passed. That was 20% and definitely no less than 10 million per year. So. But that's based on how many houses are built, obviously, or how many units are sold. Are sold. Right. Okay. All right. And that's. Sorry. 20% is what? 20% taxes annually. 20% of the recordation taxes go into the trust fund. Okay. With a floor of 10 million. So if there was a year where for some reason we haven't seen that yet, unless MB has seen it yet, but it's tippering over there. Okay. It's, you know, I think it's. It's hard to say, but we probably will be around 10 million this coming year. Just because it's dipping, because sales, the number of units available is declined, but it will still be a 10 million. Okay. And so that was, that was increased at some point recently, recent years. That was the action we didn't have prior to that. It was an allocation from the general fund. And what this did is created a percentage of a certain funding source that would go to the housing trust fund. And that was significantly more than we had been able to do most years in the journal fund. But it comes out of the recordation tax. So it's. There's not a separate fee for this that comes just directly out of the tax? Yes. Okay. Okay. That's helpful to know. Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Mister Hawkins. And then Mister Franklin. Good morning to my favorite. As of late, he says that every time I know Madam chair, you bust me out. She knows. She knows. She knows. And I see Shakinda Skinner on behalf of the county's ex office sitting down there. And we receive requests to send. Even with this new program the county council administration is setting up that when we get calls regarding emergency assistance with rental properties or anything that we need to send it through 311, do you have, and I should have given this question to our staff to put in the list to ask you, but since I didn't, I'll ask you now. Do you have the number of calls for fiscal year? For the fiscal year that came from? Three. One. One. And what's the rate of closure resolution of those? We don't. I'll get back to you. Because we have our own line, the hotline for IRAP. We don't get a lot of calls from 311. I know we get all kinds of emails through our PIA request and our. We're trying to respond to those within 24 hours when it's not us and direct them to the right agency. But we don't have 311 people coming our way because we have our own hotline. Okay. Thank you, Mister Franklin. Thank you, mister chair. Thank you, DACC and all that you do wanted to ask on the rental assistance. So the money that you have. Let me back up. No, it's open. It's been open for a few weeks. And we are getting. And we have gotten thousands of households who have applied. We are getting ready to send out an announcement that we will be reclosing that. But we will give people a few, at least a week of a notice. And those applications that we currently have will absorb most of the funding we currently have available. But we are redirecting a couple of million dollars from admin to direct payments. So we will continue helping people after we close that are below 50% and are facing eviction until the funds are fully deployed. So this was there not a period where the program was closed? Does that recall the program being closed for some period of time? The program never closed completely. It closed for all kinds of applications, but we always took applications for people that had judgments and reads. So we had the process that through an access code, we were allowing people facing evictions to apply. But we saw that this was inhibiting progress and it was creating confusion of if people should or should not apply. That's why we went ahead and changed the administrative procedure. But we have not been in a place where we say that we don't take applications so far. Okay. I didn't. I didn't know that. That was not my understanding also. So for this funding, do you have to have a situation related to Covid, or. This can be just anybody who needs rental assistance. So the statutory requirement says that you have to have a financial hardship that occurred during COVID And Covid starts in March 10, I believe, of 2020. And we haven't closed that timeline. Treasury hasn't said that the date has ended. The date ends on September of 2025. So. But you have to have any financial hardship, specifically financial habit, that occurred during that period. So if you have things that occurred five years ago and this is what you carry through, you don't qualify for that. So the hardship related to Covid, even now, you could have a hardship and still qualify. Yeah. If you lost your job, like two months ago and something happened, is due during that period where the funding is still available. Okay. And maybe everybody knew about this. I didn't know anybody. So thank you for that information. Thank you. And that's important. We do take applications through our community partners who are helping us in the court system, because there is a lot of nuance about the program that people need to know and make sure they take advantage.

Sure. Mister Harrison. Thank you. Thank you, mister chair. I know I'm not a member of the committee, so thank you for recognizing me. My question is, from the individuals that are applying that you see all across the county. Do you have them broken down by district? I can give you that information. I don't have it in front of me, but we always monitored that, and so we can pull that data. And the reason why I'm saying that is because I actually didn't know that you reopened the application process. So I haven't put out any notification to the district, you know, but if I. If I would have known, I would have pushed it out to my district for individuals that might have been in need. So whoever the communications person is with your agency, can you please make sure that they reach out to the individual council members? That way we have that information, because obviously someone knew to apply, but we did not know. Oh, absolutely. But I do want to make sure that you know that when the sheriff's office was sending out the notices, we had our flyer there, too. So even if you hadn't notified them directly, everybody who got a notice through the sheriff's office got our information directly. And we also made sure we had people in the courts. So we will make sure that you find out directly about that too. And all of the notices that we sent out. Absolutely. Yeah. I'm curious, when somebody is going through the eviction process, it can be really hard to get another apartment building willing to take take them because now their credit is shot. What is your experience with that? You say that you'll help them move, but if no other apartment is going to take them, then what happens? So what we do, we allow double security in these cases because there are some, there are people who are finding new homes. So we do see that and they may consider them at risk tenants. And so IRAP allows us, and we do that to pay twice the amount of security. So you can do it, two months security. But it is an issue I think having. That's why our first line of attack was make sure people don't get evicted, because once you have that in your record, you carry it with you for a very long time. So that was always how we did it. That's why we wanted to work very closely with the landlords and that was the overwhelming amount of applications that we handled. But if that doesn't work, then we do have that backup plan. Okay. And slightly different. But when we go back to the number of units we're trying to build. I know when we first heard this from CoG, I was kind of offended that they would expect us. I think it was 30,000 units at that time that they told us that was Prince George's share. And I mean, I know it's cog, they can't tell, tell us what to do. But I understand the guidance you're trying to give us. One problem, though, is that many people, I don't know if it's new people moving in or people who are already overcrowded, like three to five families in a house just to try to make ends meet. I don't know if these are people who already live here, who need to have an affordable place to live, or if we're talking about drawing in new people or just, you know, opening the door to the fact that new people are moving here. So I'm trying to figure that out still. And of course, anytime you're building that much, it means there's an impact on the environment. Whether we're talking roads or we're talking trees, it's going to be an impact. And one thing that I had a meeting about recently, there's an affordable development that's coming to my district that's going to be pretty large and which is great. And that it's going to help provide all that housing. On the other hand, it's going to tear down a lot of trees and it's inside the Beltway. And it's kind of uncomfortable for me because on the one hand, we need the housing. On the other hand, we also need the trees because they do provide a healthier environment for the people who live inside the beltway. So I don't know what I expect you to do about that, but I just wanted to tell you that it is a point of stress to me, and I appreciate that. I think we would like, we say that change doesn't bring stress to existing communities and existing residents. I would say that if you zoom out and look at the world and look places in the world that dealt really well with resilience, environmental and social resilience, they are not the places that put a full stop on growth and development. Look at models like Stockholm or the Netherlands. They are the places that grew and grew equitably and grew understanding how to grow with nature. So if we don't house people, they're still going to exist. And they're going to exist under stress and they're going to exist facing the housing in security that no Iraq program can solve for them. So I think that there is a silver lining and room for us to grow in our tod locations and to grow sustainably and equitably. And I'm confident this is what we can do.

And thank you for your presentation. I'll just echo the sentiment of some of my colleagues about the program being back open and then now closing because I just was made aware and was about to notify my community. But I was confused because I had sent someone to apply and this might have been a week ago, and they were told that it was already closed and that they applied, but they were like, you won't be able to get funding because everyone that's already applied has taken up the resources. And so I got that notification from a constituent, but then I also got the email with a link saying it was open. Now I'm hearing it's closing, but it'll be, I guess, technically open another week. So the only worry I have is if we do all just send this out to our constituents right now and say, okay, it's about to close, get on the list. I mean, is there really money left to provide for them or is the money pretty much allocated and spent because I don't want to give false hope to those individuals to apply. And there is no money. So it's very hard to talk generally because I know that we have communicated the last two weeks, and we did get people who came from your office and some of them didn't qualify because they had already maxed out what they were able to do. So I'm hesitating to tell you specifically through generalities, I will say that we have sent out through our newsletter all the notifications very often and through our community partners. So I understand that it hasn't gotten to everybody, but I would say that you should continue giving them all the information that comes out of our department and send them to us. And regardless of what each constituent maybe tell you, they have to talk with the people who are doing the program. And you should always feel free to know when you need our help. So I cannot assess the question because it has too much. So there is. So you're saying it's going to still be open? I guess this is the point. If someone applies until the deadline you guys have, there is possibility for them to get funding. So we're not just pushing them to apply, but technically it's allocated. And then what was the amount that it reopened with? How much more money was allocated when you guys could fully open it? We had about 10 million. And then this is when we realized that we could also save from administrative costs and put there. So right now I would say that 10 million, we project that once we close, will be fully utilized. Okay, so 10 million. Moving on to a different question. I looked at your, what was it, your goals for 2025? And one of them was really talking about enhancing affordable home ownership. And that's something that myself and I know councilmember Sydney has been really interested in as well. But looking at the loan and interest rates, I'm just curious, like, have you seen an impact with less people even going through this program? And is there, what can we do? Because we know the interest rates are really impacting people's like, monthly mortgage payments, and so you have less people open to buying. So what does that look like? So this is why we made the changes. It used to be $10,000 towards down payment assistance and we increased that to 25. And then we partnered with the state of Maryland that runs a parallel program called the MMP program. So someone who chooses to, to go through the state of Maryland can also access additional resources on top of our 25. And since we implemented this, we have seen an increase in down payment assistance. So we will be monitoring this very closely. But I think the point I was making to chair Ivy earlier is that because of the current interest rates, people who live in a home that could be accessible to a first time homeowner, and under normal circumstances right now, they would be graduating to a bigger home, so their initial home would become available. They don't do that anymore because of the interest rate. So we see not a lot of inventory of available homes for first time home buyers. So through our CDBG program, we are working through acquisition rehab efforts with our community partners where they can buy a home that is dilapidated and turn it around to affordable home ownership. We want to explore more options on the production of the inventory, because if we cannot increase the inventory, we're always going to have this issue. And to that point, I had met, I think, with it was habitat for Humanity. And I know they had, like, some, I guess you call them mini communities, maybe like six to ten homes where they purchase, and they're, you know, made to be affordable, but they didn't have something like that in Prince George's county. Looking at, I know they kind of like one off homes, but kind of building those mini communities, have we thought about doing something like that? Yeah, we actually met with them very recently, and to them, all of our resources and our programs.

Oh, am I in the wrong? That's not y'all. Which one is that? Sorry, maybe I'm. Well, it does say department of Housing and Community Development, so I want to make sure it could be. So I'm just looking at the grant section. So if it's not you, then I'll ask the right person. Okay, thank you. Our final question will come from Mister Harrison. It's just a. It's just a quick comment, mister chair, councilmember, orator. You spoke about smaller communities that, with more affordable housing in them, our zoning code calls for, we're allowed micro housing, but it's on one micro house per lot. And so we have to look at our zoning to understand what we can do, because that the definition you just gave was a cluster. And so clusters are not permitted in the county. So we have to look at ways where we can have a pilot program. And our great leader over there at Merrill National Capital park and planning, Miss Lakeisha, she's got experience in micro housing. And so the conversations are happening, but how we go about it to safeguard as well our community, because you don't want to create an opportunity where you have too much inventory and then you have high vacancies. So that's something that we're looking into right now. But I think it's, all of us are very interested in how we address affordable housing. Thank you. Can I clarify? I think you were asking about the neighborhood conservation initiative, NCI. Okay. That is a very old program that has been deployed and right now it has only a very small amount of program income. So that was all money many years ago that have already been deployed. I was wondering, I was like, that's a little bit of money to do that kind of work. Okay. Thank you. Okay. I think we're. We're finished. We thank you for being here. I think we. On behalf of the committee, I want to remind you that communications would be really helpful. Absolutely. Because we can do a lot to help spread the word. So anything you can do to advance communication be appreciated. Will do. Okay. Thank you very much. And then.

The fiscal year 2025 proposed budget for the Housing Authority of Prince George's county is 98,882,500, an increase of 465,700 or 0.5% over the fiscal year 2024 approved budget. This increase is due to the section eight housing Choice voucher program. Their budget is made up of grant funds. Compensation accounts for 5,678,788, 88,500 or 1.5% decrease. Fringe benefits is at 2,027,300 with an 8800 or 0.4% increase in operating is at 91,176,500 with a $545,000 or 0.6% increase. As of March 15, 2024, the authority has 18 vacancies the full scope of vacancies can be found on page two of the report, but the position with the most vacancies is a community development assistant position with seven vacancies. The voucher program is most impacted by vacancies and this has led to challenges with maintaining and maintaining the waiting list and processing recertifications for families. Their budget includes a salary lapse of 1,243,800 which is 18% of compensation expenditures but less than the historical vacancy of 23%. Also on page two of the report you will see the breakdown of grant revenue for the housing assistance and rental assistance divisions. The rental assistance division saw a 465,000 5700 decrease due to the bond program delay and repositioning cottage City. However, the housing assistance division is proposed at 2,858,200. The rental assistance division is proposed at 96,024,300. On page three of the report you will find a breakdown of the previously mentioned operating expenses proposed at 98.8 million. The largest operation expenditure include miscellaneous admin expenses due to the county it support cost which was not in the fiscal year 2024 approved budget budget and general expenses due to insurance and projected bad debt write offs re", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Habitat for Humanity", "insights": [{"observation": "Habitat for Humanity has been involved in developing affordable mini-communities, but not currently in Prince George's County.

The largest operation expenditure include miscellaneous admin expenses due to the county it support cost which was not in the fiscal year 2024 approved budget budget and general expenses due to insurance and projected bad debt write offs regarding housing choice voucher allocations, 196 project based vouchers are being used in 5790 tenant based vouchers are being used bringing the total to 5900 vouchers with a utilization rate of 93.5% which increased by 0.5% from fiscal year 2020. Three's report some highlights of fiscal year 2024 for the housing authority include increased landlord recruitment which they recruited 93 landlords in fiscal year 2023 and 2024 combined. They engaged landlords in the advisory committee to improve voucher utilization and they maintain their high performer rating under HUD. As an update, the waitlist is being periodically purged and 459 unresponsive applicants have been removed from the waiting list, bringing the waiting list to 775 applicants. This is a 3.1 year waiting list which was previously reported as six years. In fiscal year 2023, they plan to implement a customer service center and they are still working on a plan to reposition all public housing developments. Challenges for fiscal year 2025 were reported as unexpected staff turnover and the inability to quickly fill vacant positions due to the lack of staff to implement the HR processes as well as the reorganization of their office to return to full time in office which will increase staff turnover. Thank you and please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you Miss Miller Y. Any questions for Miss Miller? Yeah. Yes Miss Riada I just want to make sure I captured one of your comments correctly. It was, I think, for the voucher program, and it was the wait times from six years to three. And then I think you mentioned people being removed from the list, but I wasn't clear on the why people were removed. So housing Authority reported that they removed unresponsive applicants from the waiting list in last fiscal year. They reported having more applicants, but 459 were removed, bringing the waiting list to 3.1 years instead of the six years which they reported in fiscal year 2023. Thank you. Okay. Welcome, Director Anderson Preston. Thank you for joining us. Are we set for a presentation? Yes, sir. Any introductory words? Yes. Well, good morning and thank you for the opportunity to speak on the housing authority's budget. I am Newt. I am week number nine in my position as the executive director of the Housing authority. I'm excited to be here and be able to answer your questions. So I do have a brief presentation. There we go. All right. So the Housing Authority of Prince George's county is a semi autonomous governmental agency charged with the provision of housing assistance services through the use of the Housing Choice voucher program, housing Authority owned public housing units, and other affordable housing programs. The housing authority also has the capacity to issue bonds to support the construction and rehabilitation of housing for low and moderate income individuals. The housing authority is comprised of three support units, the Housing Authority administration, financial and administrative services and compliance divisions, as well as two program divisions which are the rental assistance division and the Housing Assistance Division. The housing Assistance Division manages approximately 400 rental units, including five public housing residential sites. We have 376 public housing units which are funded through HUD operating and capital subsidies. OuR HUD operating subsidies and tenant rental revenues are the primary source of revenue for the day to day operations of our public housing sites. The Housing Choice Voucher Division administers and implements federal housing assistance programs for low income families who have met the federal eligibility requirements through the voucher program. Under the voucher program, a housing subsidy is paid to the landlord directly by the housing authority on behalf of the participating families. Families then pay the difference between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized by the voucher program. Under certain circumstances, if authorized by the housing authority, a family may use its voucher to purchase home. In fiscal year 2024, we administered a total of 5986 vouchers. As Miss Shailene noted, we have a number of vacancies. We are working to fill these vacancies. We are working to. We have a number of interviews that we are currently undergoing for the housing division for our housing assistance division, we are bringing in house a number of positions that are currently being performed by contractors as well as for our financial administrative services division. Here is a brief overview of the budget that Miss Shailene went over, so I will not review that again. Some additional information on our grant descriptions we have about 2,379,000 for our conventional public housing sites. We've received an additional $72,000 grant from HUD to fund a resident opportunity self sufficiency program. That program provides salaries for a caseworker to work with our public housing residents and", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Housing Authority of Prince George's County", "insights": [{"observation": "The

Some additional information on our grant descriptions we have about 2,379,000 for our conventional public housing sites. We've received an additional $72,000 grant from HUD to fund a resident opportunity self sufficiency program. That program provides salaries for a caseworker to work with our public housing residents and help them achieve self sufficiency. Coral Gardens is a development that the housing authority owns that is not public housing. That development receives 147,000. We also have a single family scattered site on Marcy Avenue that is a lease to own home that we are working with that family on achieving homeownership with our public housing program. We have modernization and capital funds about $247,000. Our family self sufficiency program has received an additional grant from HUD. The FSS program provides for caseworkers that work with our voucher and public housing residents in helping them achieve their self sufficiency goals. With the Family self sufficiency program, families are able to earn escrow amounts that is determined based on as their income increases and the amount of subsidy that they require decreases. The the delta between their old subsidy and the new decreased subsidy amount is put into an escrow account. Families can use that escrow as down payment funds and other uses that help them achieve their self sufficiency goals. We also have estimated $350,000 in fees to be received from our bond program and our voucher program receives about $95 million in HUD grant subsidies. A rough overview of our public housing portfolio includes Owens Road, which has 123 units Marlborough town, which has 63 units Kimberly Gardens, which has 50 units rolling crest has 40 units, Cottage City has 100 units and coral gardens has 16 units. The housing authority is currently engaged in the repositioning of Cottage City. Cottage City is 100 unit mid rise public housing building located in Cottage City, Maryland. Constructed in 1971, it's six stories on 3.17 acres. It currently has 54 efficiency units and 45 one bedroom units. It is currently currently 100% affordable and comprised of mostly seniors and individuals with disabilities. We are looking to begin the rehabilitation of Cottage City in the fall of 2024. The substantial rehab includes renewing all of the major building systems. The units will remain 100% affordable to families at 50% of the Erie media income and for a family of one, the 2024 amis that were just released in April. A family of one at 50% of the AMI is $54,150 for a family of 477 thousand. $350. The repositioning will also include improved amenities such as improved community center, computer area, gym, laundry lounge, library, new patio space, and a new office suite for the property management office. During this construction, we are seeking to receive a bronze national green building standard certification. We'll also replace windows and upgrade the facade. This project is funded approximately with $12 million in low income housing tax credits, $3.5 million in partnership rental housing, 2.5 million in housing housing investment trust funds and an additional $25 million in bonds. Our housing Choice voucher program has 900, I'm sorry, 5986 vouchers. We are currently leased 5697 of our vouchers. We also have an additional allocation of emergency housing vouchers that are 95%. Our average per unit cost per month is $1,379. We removed a number of applicants from the waiting list, 459 and those removals come through the application pull list so when families are selected from the application, if those families do not respond to the notice of application selection, they are removed. The last time the waiting list was open was in 2015. We are preparing to open the waiting list this calendar year. That will include upgrading our software systems to have the process be online. We have currently 775 families on the waiting list. The house the housing Choice voucher program has a unique feature where participants may utilize their voucher to purchase a home in fiscal year 2020. 318 voucher participants were able to purchase a home using their voucher and in fiscal year 2024, we currently have two families scheduled to close. So it's still early in the year. We're hopeful that we can increase that number and that concludes my presentation. Any questions? Thank you very much. Questions, folks, who's Ivy? Thank you. Cottage City is in my district and I'm wondering, I saw the list of things that you're going to do, but I didn't see anything about individual units being rehabbed. Is there anything going to happen in inside people's apartments? All of the interiors will be rehabbed and updated, new kitchens, new baths. And what happens to the people who lived there during this rehab and how long will it take? So the plan is to relocate the families during the rehabilitation? It is anticipated that the rehabilitation will be approximately 18 months. We are looking at two potential relocation options. One is in place relocation where they are relocated within the building while one half of the building is being renovated. We're also looking at off site relocation options for families that the in place relocation would not be a good option for. That means that half the building will be empty. Yes.

We're also looking at off site relocation options for families that the in place relocation would not be a good option for. That means that half the building will be empty. Yes. So I'm just trying to pinpoint what happens to that many families. Where can you put them? We have a relocation person that is specialized in that field. We have done individual assessments of each household to determine what their needs are, and we will match each household with a housing option, whether that is in place or. We have identified units at our other public housing sites, Owens Road, to be specific. And we have allocated or set aside a number of tenant based vouchers for those relocation families. All of the costs of the relocation will be borne by the project, so it will not be an expense to the family. Okay. And the last thing. Well, actually, one thing is how much do people end up paying for those units out of their pockets? Well, currently they are public housing units, so families pay 30% of their adjusted income toward their rent. So, you know, it depends on how much it makes. And I did not know that you all had a program that contributed to homeownership. I only saw one listed, one current family being helped with that. Is that only the one, or are there others that weren't listed? Well, we have our voucher program, but the. The one individual single family public housing unit is a. It's a. It's an old HUD program called Turnkey Three. Oh. It doesn't exist anymore, but there's still. That's the one that Miss Oreato was asking about. There's just a handful of families that are still converting to homeownership under that old HUD program. Okay. Yeah. It seems that if you're to the point where you. You can only afford, you know, a small amount of money, it would be hard to actually maintain a home. That is a challenge, for sure. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Mister Olson, thank you very much for being here and for your presentation question about the housing choice voucher program. So, yeah, the last time the waitlist was open was 2015. I mean, I met someone when I was campaigning who had been on the list for ten years. These are federal vouchers that go through the county, correct? Yes, sir. So has the federal money not grown, or it's just not keeping up with the demand? What's happening on the federal side? On the federal side, we do have both a unit allocation, which is the 5986, and we also have a budget allocation. So while we are 93% unit utilized, we are 100% budget utilized. HUD has issued a number of nofas for special vouchers, special housing vouchers, be it family unification vouchers or vash vouchers that are specific to veterans. But there has not been a widespread increase of vouchers made available to housing authorities to increase their baseline number of vouchers that are available for families to use. Okay. But I guess what I'm asking is, has the pot grown over time at the federal level and we just. The pot has just remained stagnant. Correct. So there has not been an opportunity for housing authorities to increase the number of vouchers available to issue. So our baseline is 5960. Okay. Whatever the number is. Yeah. That number has not increased. HUD has not given an additional allocation of vouchers to use. Okay, and then you said the 93% are units, is that correct? Yes, those are vouchers. Yes, voucher units. 93% being the number that we have been successful at leasing. Leasing, okay. I mean, I know that's only 7% delta, but what are we doing to try to capture that 7% that we haven't? So a number of those are allocated for our project based vouchers that we have vouchers allocated, but they are not currently utilized. So we have those set aside for when families lease the project based vouchers. We're also setting aside a number for our relocation resources for Cottage City. We talked about relocating those families. We also have a number that we try to keep available for our public housing families that may need a reasonable accommodation, and we may not have a unit in our public housing portfolio that would meet their accessibility needs. And again, we're also budget 100% budget utilized. So we're try to make sure we stay within budget, even though that may be under the units. Okay. And have we made it a priority to try to get movement on the federal side? I mean, we can certainly, as elected officials, can try to push for that, but, I mean, is there, I assume we're part of a national association and all that, you know, and we don't need to get into all that. But, I mean, has there been a push? Like, there's been a push for years? Yeah, it hasn't gone too far. I will say last calendar year, Hud did make a handful of new vouchers available. And when I say a handful, I think, I'm not sure how many Prince George county received, but I do know that other housing authorities received maybe like five or ten additional vouchers. Okay. So a literal not much. Yeah. Okay. Madam Chair, I think this is something we need to add to our federal request. I think we're going to have to request that we have a democratic president.

Absolutely. Absolutely. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Chair. Thank you. I see Mister Franklin's on the screen. Did you have any questions, Mister Franklin? Yes, thank you Mister chair. And thank you for the presentation from housing authority. And congratulations on being new to the position. So, and I've understood that, you know, the waiting list and the years and the length and the sort of the lack of capacity in the housing voucher program. So when someone gets a voucher for public housing, they get it forever or there's a time limit. It seems like there's no turnover. There is no time limit for the housing choice voucher program or the public housing program. Turnover only occurs if someone violates the program rules and they are terminated from the program or they. Yes, they have the ultimate graduation, which is death. So quite honestly, that's why, that's why there's, that's why there's never anybody new that gets admitted because they get it forever. I mean, if I was getting, if I was getting a subsidy forever, I might keep it forever as well. It would almost be a disincentive to get to a better situation where I couldn't get it anymore. And I don't know if that's something you can do anything abOut, But I MEAN, I think that's going to be an inherent problem with the program. I mean, whatever number you put it at. Yes. Whenever it gets to max, no one's going to leave you. It's never going to change over and we're going to be right in the same problem. That is an issue. The term limits are set by federal regulations. So the housing authority doesn't have ANy set say in that. There is a special program that HUD has called MOve to work that allows some housing authorities to implement pilot programs such as term limits. Prince George's county is not a move to work program. So we don't have those flexibilities. But the conversation around term limits has been going on for years, the HUD housing sphere, so. Got it. Yeah. I MEAN, in times of finite budgets, I just DOn't see that that's going to, there's ever going to be any progress if people can stay on it forever. That's JusT my thought. Thank you. Thank you, MISTER CHAIR. Okay. Thank you. Mister Franklin, did Missouri have some. Yes, one thing, and I apologize if you mentioned it, but when they mentioned that you guys removed people off of the list for being non responsive, did you elaborate by what did non responsive mean, what was the standard for non responsive? So when we send out notifications to families on the waiting list, usually those are mail outs. So we are sending it to the address that they provided at the time of the waiting list or that they updated. And if they don't receive respond to the notification, then we do remove them as being non responsive. So a family can come back if they get the notice late and request to be put back on the waiting list. And in those situations we do. But it could be since the waiting list wasn't open since 2015, that they don't live at the address that we had at the moment. So a lot, we do get a lot of returns from when we pull from the waiting list. And I'm assuming, like, that's the only way you had to contact people, maybe you weren't asking for other pieces of information, it was just where they lived. Probably not. In 2015, when we open the waiting list this time, we'll use software that will allow us to get email addresses and other electronic forms of communication that people use more now than just the mail app. So it's fair to say those people might still be in need. It's just we didn't know how to really actually communicate with them because they could be transient in nature and not live there like a decade later. Very well could be the case. Absolutely. Fair point. Curious about what other jurisdictions are doing to, I guess, bridge the gap with the lack of the federal government increasing, because other people have told me, well, Montgomery county funds vouchers. Are you seeing that in other jurisdictions where they're carving out parts of their budget to get at their waiting list? Yes, I have seen that in other jurisdictions, it's a pretty expensive program to fund to have a supplemental voucher program, but there could be one created here in Prince George's county. Based on the research that we do have, I believe our per unit per month cost for the voucher program is $1,379. So that's per voucher per month. So if you multiply that times twelve times the number of people, it gets pretty expensive pretty quick. And is that number set? Are you seeing other jurisdictions that are supplementing it, like reducing the subsidized amount, or is there flexibility there so that you can meet some people halfway and maybe not full way of the standard from the federal dollars? There are all kinds of ways to bridge that gap. You know, having supplemental assistance in addition to the voucher program is one way. There are jurisdictions that have a voucher program, something similar to how HUD has set up, but they don't allow current voucher program users to su", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Prince George's County Housing Authority", "insights": [{"observation": "The waiting list and the years and the length and the sort of the lack of capacity in the housing voucher program.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "There is no time limit for the housing choice voucher program or the public housing program.

There are all kinds of ways to bridge that gap. You know, having supplemental assistance in addition to the voucher program is one way. There are jurisdictions that have a voucher program, something similar to how HUD has set up, but they don't allow current voucher program users to subscribe to it, because then you have, you know, the people that don't, that aren't in the lucky 5946, they get no subsidy. So some jurisdictions have that program open to those that are not able to get a housing choice voucher to sort of spread the subsidy to those who don't have it already. And the last question about the project based ones. So do you keep, so those are projects that are pending that have agreed to have set asides or. So the project based voucher program, under the voucher program, federal rules, allows housing authorities to take a certain percentage of their tenant based allocation and give it to a particular or particular projects or developments. And so in that case, the subsidy that the family would receive is tied to that particular unit in that particular building, versus a tenant based voucher where you can take and rent anywhere. We typically have open solicitation to solicit for landlords and property owners, typically multifamily, to give them an allocation of project based vouchers. Is there a limit on it? Like, for example, I know how some, they're going to have these set sites for 30 years, and then it opens back up and you can rotate it to another project, or is it indefinite? So, and I don't want to misspeak, but I believe the program rules allow us to project base up to 20% of our tenant based allocation. And then once you get to the project level, there are a number of HUD rules that say only 25% of a project can be project based unless they are providing specialized services to, to the families there. And then there's some other details that no more than four units in a building can have project based vouchers. And it gets a little more detailed. Thank you. I just wanted to remind us all that Montgomery County's budget is 7.1 billion and ours is 5.4 billion. So I THInK ThAt's a big reason why we haven't been able to put more money into the program. Speaking of cutting it off of the pass, any more questions? Seeing none. Oh, mister early, mister chair. I just wanted to alert the council there will probably be some minor adjustments when we send down our post, our post signy die adjustments related to the budget, because the, you know, as the new director has identified some adjustments, they're not major in the way she wants to structure personnel. So we'll see some minor adjustments coming. This will be early, late information. Yes. With that, we thank you, really appreciate it, and we will move on with the budget review and we will take a two minute recess. Mister Hawkins, do you second a two minute recess? Two minute recess, folks. Okay, we ready? Okay folks, are we ready? Madam clerk? Okay, so we're, so we're back for CB 15 2024 amendments and park and planning issue. Well, there's a lot of amendments on the website, so we've already passed two amendments at our last meeting, so we're not going to talk about those, hopefully. So we're only taking testimony on the amendments and we just got an amendment in last night, so I'm not sure everybody's seen that. It's regarding the AR zone and parking planning has not addressed that yet. Now parking planning is issued. Was RPD allowed in the ar zone? Same thing. She looked horrified, so I wasn't sure if this one. So everyone should have the parking planning memo that addressed all the other amendments. So I don't think we need to go down that, and we probably need that on the council website for folks who have not seen the parking planning memo. And what I'm trying to do is make this as efficient as possible because we have a number of people signed up to speak and they have a number of amendments, so this could take a while. And it's already 1140, so just trying to be efficient. Having said that, Mister Harrison, do you want to say something? Mister chair, I know you made a comment about the RPd zone and the amendment that came in last night. If I can, with brevity, I was going to turn to you.

The agricultural forestry use of agricultural forestry related use not required to be in the principal use. Basically, the genesis of this is that the new zoning ordinance was intended to modernize the zoning code into to prove the ability to serve the county's land use goals, policies and objectives, not to upend the carefully considered decisions of county leadership that embodied in the existing master plan to make rash changes to the uses allowed under the prior zoning ordinance, but neglecting to provide a mechanism to apply for the residential plan development zone to residential development on properties and properties in other based zones like the AR zone. The new zoning ordinance actually blocks the county from implementing its master plan. It creates obstacles to high end quality projects that are not only desirable, but necessary to achieve the master plan and general plan goals, as well as other county projects policies. Basically, Mister chair, the reason why the amendment was put in the new ordinance restricts the use of planned development zones, which are meant to encourage innovative and high quality developers, especially for properties that were formerly zoned ra the impact of the new ordinance to the AR zone. The ordinance categorized the AR zone as a rule and agricultural base zone, which makes it ineligible for residential plan development zoning, even though it allows large lot residential developments. This limits the flexibility and the creativity of projects in the AR zone and reduces the opportunity to preserve environmental and cultural features the district council will still have the opportunity for. The proposed amendment will allow owners to apply for a rezoning to the RPD zone that needs to be in compliance with the sector plans. Council will be able to review and disapprove or approve. It is not a right by approval. Mister chairman, if I. Sounds like the seat request I had. Miss Vakus, I just wanted to point out for everyone to follow along since we kind of went into the amendment. This we're talking about in your virtual binder. This is part of the virtual binder. It is on page 665 of the virtual binder. It is SJH for the maker's initials, PHed. Amendment number two. And that's where it's affecting pages 118 and 19 of the bill. And the rest is everything else Mister Harrison said. Yeah, Mister Hawkins, Mister Varkas. There was a piece in there that one time I saw it, and now it's not in there. Did you take out something in that bill? Did you remove. Did you remove the RPD zone? Yeah, this is exactly what I was told to put together by Mister Harrison. Thank you. All right, I'll turn to miss hall if you would like to address this particular amendment. Canada. This is something that you had not had seen prior to last night or this morning. Exactly. Exactly. My name is Lakeisha hall. I'm the planning director for Prince George's county. For the record. So, staff has not had a chance to review this latest language. And so we would appreciate some more time to further analyze the impacts of it, in addition to all the other amendments that we did have a chance to look at. So that's where we are at this time. Thank you. And would you provide, to the best of your ability, a map showing which properties would be eligible for this particular amendment? Absolutely, sir. Okay. Does anyone on the council have any questions of Mister Harrison? I would like to see the analysis and all that. So we're not going to act on that today, I'm assuming. So let me for the genesis of this, you all this is about our legacy. Farmers having the flexibility to extract value from their properties that are already surrounded by dense development. So, you know, I know we in the interest of time today and needing more time, if this is the will of the body, then I will definitely would like Maryland National Capital park and planning to have some more time to review it. But if we. We could deal with this at the next meeting and deal with this out, being able to report it out, it would be greatly appreciated. Mister Harrison. I think it's the committee's goal. I'm speaking beyond myself, and you were part of the discussion earlier in the week. We want to move everything out next meeting. Okay. That's the plan. Okay. Thank you. Before I go to the public.

So, Andrew Rogers, deputy CEO for economic development. When I was before the committee the last time on this, I think I brought up three issues, two of which have been adequately addressed in these amendments by the planning department. One regarding some additional protections that we wanted to see for larger projects. Sort of going through their planning process. And the, I think existing language talked about changes allowed at 10% or 30,000 sqft, whichever is less. And we wanted to see that go to whichever is greater, in order to provide some protection for larger projects that may take a longer time to get through their developments. So we're happy to see that change. Happy to see a change which I think had been talked about on the council for a while regarding some extended period for uses to go dark in projects extending from 180 days to three years in the changes that we see now. So we're happy to see that. And the only lingering concern which we expressed in the last hearing is about the townhomes in CGO zones outside of the beltway. I think, as I indicated last time, I would like to see maybe a broader boundary for that. If we were going to consider something. I don't think that the beltway is the right boundary. There are lots of established communities that are rightfully still growing that are sort of in right outside the beltway. And so for that, I think we would still want to see a different boundary than the beltway for that particular change. That concludes my. Thank you Miss Rogers.

So my question is this proposed bill extension, is it for the betterment of PG county constituents or for builders? And is it fair and equitable? The proposed bill gave then and you five years to make corrections. I would suggest you let them utilize the new as written and make the corrections moving forward. Or are you content on letting them drive your decision for their benefit, not on what you promised when you ran? Thank you. Thank you. Mister Gracey, Mister Tedesco and Miss Gingold, come towards the front and then Mister Haller. Is Mister Haller here? I think he's on his way. He was in planning board. Mister chair. Too bad. Just kidding. Mister Chairman, madam vice chair, members of the committee and council members. Good. Almost afternoon. For the record, Matthew Tedesco with a law firm of McNaM. I want to thank Mister chairman for his leniency. In the three minutes I will be very brief. I may go a minute over, but I will be succinct. First and foremost, I want to thank Director hall and the planning department and staff and express our gratitude for the ability to provide input and suggestive edits that were considered by the drafters of CB 15. This deals with Mister Dunoga's transitional provisions amendment. While not all of our suggestions have been advanced in the amendment sheet before the committee this morning, we recognize that the current amendments are a huge step in the road right direction. With that being said, I do need to highlight one amendment that is not included that we wish to raise for consideration by the committee, and it deals with section 20 717 oh seven, and that can be found on page nine, line 17 of your amendment sheet for the transition provisions. We would respectfully request that the reference on line 17 to April 1, 2022 be deleted and in its place, insert the words quote after the expiration of any grandfathering provisions in sections 20 717, oh four a and D. Close quote this edit will ensure that the grandfathering provided in sections 20 717, oh four a and d in the amendment sheet is not disturbed, at least prior to the expiration of said grandfathering vis a future sectional map amendment by this council. Although we wish to further reserve the right to be able to provide additional suggestions to further improve upon the transition provisions, we again appreciate everyone's consideration and understanding on the desire to collectively ensure that we create a successful development review process for the county and move our zoning ordinance to the 21st century. I look forward to continued and future opportunities to coordinate with staff and all stakeholders. Turning to Mister Franklin's amendment, I would we are in support of this amendment for all the reasons articulated by the zoning hearing examiner and the planning board when they opposed CB 320 23 last year. The current provisions of section 27 3604 e one c and 27 3605 e six create confusion, irreconcilable conflicts between planning and zo", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Lincoln Vista Civic Association", "insights": [{"observation": "The proposed bill extension, is it for the betterment of PG county constituents or for builders?

Turning to Mister Franklin's amendment, I would we are in support of this amendment for all the reasons articulated by the zoning hearing examiner and the planning board when they opposed CB 320 23 last year. The current provisions of section 27 3604 e one c and 27 3605 e six create confusion, irreconcilable conflicts between planning and zoning, between zoning, the zoning warrants and the subdivision regulations, and with case law, all of which create uncertainty and the inability to uniformly administer the county code. As the hearing examiner stated in opposition to CB 320 23, quote planning involves setting future goals at a point static in time that furthers the police powers, while zoning must consider in real time whether a particular zone or use should be granted. The current language in these sections ties these two concepts, planning and zoning closer, ignoring the fact that they are not synonymous. It is impossible to implement master plans or administer the zoning warrants when these documents and the zones created with the CMA conflict with each other. Turning to the amendment regarding the CGO zone. We would oppose that amendment given the current housing crisis that the county is facing being behind the needs for housing as reported by the Washington Post, including the county budget deficits that will grow larger due to the lost revenue from the lack of recreation and transfer taxes, the county should be encouraging housing opportunities and not discouraging them by imposing lengthy, expensive entitlement obligations. And finally, Mister chairman, regarding Mister Harrison's amendment for the ability to simply request or an application to to rezone to the RPD zone in the AR zone. We would support that for the reasons that Mister Harrison articulated this morning. Thank you so much for your consideration. Thank you. Mister Tedesco, Janet Gingold then Mister Gibbs, good morning. My name is Janet Gingold and I'm speaking today on behalf of the Prince Georgia Sierra Club. We need a zoning ordinance that works for the people by furthering the goals of the zoning Rewrite Plan 2035 and the Climate Action Plan. We're counting on you to strengthen the guardrails that empower the council to reject proposals for haphazard development that causes environmental degradation and harms the quality of life for future principles. Georgians, please reject the amendment of language regarding conformance with the planning documents. Planning is necessary to ensure that equitable and sustainable use of limited resources occurs. Plans aren't perfect and many of our planning documents need to be updated. However, even the best possible plans won't help us meet our community's needs if development doesn't conform with the plans. Please fortify a system that heeds the expertise of planners working in the interests of the people. The speculations of individual developers should not determine what we build and where we build it. The public counts on the district council to say no to unwise development, and the council needs guardrails that allow and require it to say no regarding residential development in CGO zones. Yes, we need more housing for our growing population. However, for growth that puts less stress on the county budget and reduces vehicle miles traveled, we need housing development to occur in parts of the county that already have access to public transit and public infrastructure. Please reject the proposed amendments that would greenlight continued car development sprawl by allowing townhouse developments in CGO zones outside the beltway. Townhouses or multifamily housing should be built outside the beltway if and only if they are in a planned development zone designed to decrease vehicle miles traveled and improve climate. Climate resilience please strengthen the whole process for planned development zones by adding criteria for public benefits that include reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving climate resilience regarding data centers in the ag zone zone. Given our dependence on data, data centers have to go somewhere. In siting these facilities, decision makers need to consider how they add to the cumulative environmental impacts experienced by already overburdened populations and how to mitigate potential impacts. The requirement for a detailed site plan does not go far enough to protect the county's rural land and to ensure adequate protection from air pollution and noise. Setbacks should be larger both for residences and for places of worship. Requirements should include power backup with on site batteries or generators with tier four or greater emissions controls to offset power taken from the grid. On site solar installations should be required. Measures for noise mitigation and reduction of light pollution should also be required. If requirements include specifications and locations for backup generators, battery energy storage systems and solar energy installations, decision makers will be better able to assess potential impacts and mitigating factors prior to approving permits. That's all I have for today for this one. Thank you. Thank you. Four minutes. Not bad. Mister Gibbs, Mister Antonetti. Mister Horne. Yes. Good morning.

That's all I have for today for this one. Thank you. Thank you. Four minutes. Not bad. Mister Gibbs, Mister Antonetti. Mister Horne. Yes. Good morning. Committee chair Durnoga, council chair Ivey, vice chair Harrison, members of the committee, Edward Gibbs, an attorney with offices right here in Largo. I want to address myself as briefly as possible to three issues. The first thing I'm going to hit are the transitional provisions in the amendment that is before you today. I really want to express my thanks and appreciation for everyone who has worked hard to bring forward the amendment you have today. In particular, I want to recognize the park and planning commission and therein Mister Warner, for all of his hard work. I would echo Mister Tedesco's concern about section 20 717, oh seven found on page nine, which would allow projects that are still covered by the grandfathering provisions to be made a non conforming use in thus lose the variability. To have grandfathering that you have created with this bill, that's a pretty difficult thing to deal with. And I would echo his recommendation for the amendment language and then I would like to address amendment one. A dealing with data centers in the AG zone. I represent Arclight. They are now the owners of Keys Energy center. I assisted in the approval process for Keys Energy center. They have a 167 acre parcel and brandywine. They have an arrangement in place if they can get a text amendment to permit this use in the Ag zone to have a data center developed there. And when we did, the property is very irregular in shape so it's difficult to site buildings. And so we offered some language for an amendment that would allow the ship use in the AG zone. And we said it had to be 125 acres, that it had to have co location with an existing electrical generation facility, which we have and which makes it synergistic. And we proffered detailed site plan approval. Every other zoning classification that allows a data center doesn't have any requirement for a detailed site plan. So the setbacks, the way the building looks, and by the way, these buildings are quite attractive can all be determined at the detailed site plan stage. I was surprised when I saw the amendment online Tuesday evening which said 300ft setback from, quote, residential use, which I'm really not sure what that means, but because of the unique situation of this property, they are requesting an amendment to allow it to be 200ft from a residential dwelling unit. Now bear in mind that they want to meet every noise requirement that exists, and we've offered to make it clear that it's section 19 122, which is the 6555 dba daytime nighttime for residential impacts. We will satisfy that. We agree with all the buffering and screening, but to these buildings are going to be seen whether they're 500ft away from residential use, but it's how they look, how they're built and how they're buffered and how they meet the noise criteria that's important. And 200ft allows this project to go forward with detailed site plan approval. I would also embrace Mister Tedesco's comments relative to the CGO zone. You know, people aren't being given a right here. They got the CGO zone. It permitted those residential uses in all locations. And those folks who have made plans and developed plans to go forward with uses that were permitted and now see that they might be taken away or made it very difficult to achieve are placed in a severe disadvantage. So thank you very much for your time and I appreciate your indulgence in allowing me to go over. Thank you. Mister Gibbs, Mister Antonetti, Mister Horne and Kathy Bartolomeo. Good afternoon. Chair Dunogo, members of the committee, members of the council. My name is Robert Anson. Eddie with the law firm of Shipley and Horn. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss CB 15 and the amendments before you. I testified at the March 21 PHED committee regarding the legislation as a whole and asked the committee to pause its passage for the time being. So we had more opportunity to review the bill with staff. I'm pleased to report, as you've heard already, that we've had that opportunity, at least initially, to talk with the planning director, the chair and some members of the planning staff to talk about the most pressing issue facing existing development, which is the transitional provisions. We have come up with common ground. That amendment is before you today and with Mister Dasko's amendment, which I do support. I am supportive of that revised transitional amendment package, and we thank you and thank the staff for their consideration and opportunity to work together collaboratively. I am in support of revisions to the master plan, compliance for special exceptions and detailed site plans proposed by Mister Franklin. You have heard before. It is notable that out of the 43 master sector plans in the county, I believe that only two have been updated since the effective date of the new zoning ordinance, and there's only been one sectional map amendment, soon to be two. There is potential for many conflicts between planning and zoning across the entire county because of how the current law is written.

There is potential for many conflicts between planning and zoning across the entire county because of how the current law is written. And the amendment for you is necessary to allow for quality and appropriate development to move forward. In the alternative, I think we should look to expedite master plan and sector plan revisions and to approve corresponding sectional map amendment changes to better align development priorities. I think that's a better way to handle it in the future and future omnibus bills. I would ask that consideration be given to that process and the efficiency of that process. I do support the amendment by Vice chair Harrison to allow the ability of certain Ar zone properties to apply for the RPD zone if they are in the established communities designation. The general plan I would respectfully request that this be expanded to properties in the Ag zone that also ag zone that are in the established communities area. In particular, this could greatly assist the redevelopment of the Glendale Hospital site, which is in the Ag zone, in the established communities, and has gone through numerous amounts of community input and planning on the public side. And it would be the opportunity to move that project forward and to make it a reality for the CGO zones. As others have testified, we do oppose the CGO amendment impacting the ability to build towns and multifamily and land outside the beltway. It's still a drastic policy change which contradicts the mixed use purposes of the CGO zone. The general plan does allow development such as this outside the Beltway, and so do certain master plans. A special exception is a very heavily heavy procedure, an expensive procedure which can take twelve to 18 months for approval, and we feel that that is excessive in light of the county's need for additional housing. In short, I am supportive of the amendments here today to the transitional provisions, the master plan conformance requirements, and due respect, the request that the AG zone be added to Mister Harrison's amendment, if that is the will of the body. I do remain opposed to the CGO revisions for the reasons stated. I do look forward over the next several years working with the planning department and the council on future omnibus this legislation that will help lead us to a zoning ordinance that will deliver quality development and economic growth that is vital for Prince George's county. And I thank you for your time today. Thank you Mister Horn, Mister Bartimaeo and Mister Patel, I guess good afternoon now. Committee chair Dunoga, councilor chair Ivey, members of the PHED committee and of the council. My name is Arthur Horne from the law Office of Shipyard Horn, here representing several property owners potentially impacted by CB 15 and some of the proposed amendments here today. As I previously done, I'm testifying today to support the majority of amendments proposed here today concerning the transitional provision provisions and the master plans. My testimony here will mirror that concerning CB 27 which is here today, and I'm in support of that proposed amendments. Concerning the transitional provisions, I'd like to thank chair Ivey and park and planning staff for dillingy working on these transitional provisions revisions that are necessary for the continuing smooth transition into the new use of the use of the new ordinance. I would also like to support and thank council member Franklin for his amendment concerning revisions to the master plan consistency with special exceptions and detailed site plans. These revisions are crucial given the county's 43 existing master plans, which everyone admits are mostly outdated. And as you heard here in previous testimony, since the countywide map amendment on April 1, 2022 became effective, there's only been two approved master plans and one SMA. The council has rezoned thousands of acres of property comprehensively and via piecemeal applications, and the property owners must be able to develop their property in a manner consistent with those existing zones. Otherwise, the zoning of person's property means nothing if there's a mandatory requirement for master plan consistency when in those many cases, the master plan and the land use recommendation now no longer agree with the proposed zoning that exists. The language proposed by councilmember Franklin is consistent with the prior zoning ordinance requiring special subject uses must be substantially, must not substantially impair the integrity and validity of the master plan or in the absence of that, an area master plan or general plan. I also would like to support councilmember Harrison's proposed amendment concerning the residential plan development zones to include LMX, LCD and AR, especially the AR. The residential plan development simply allows the property owner the opportunity to demonstrate that the property should be considered for different zones with the added public benefits just as required in the residential base zones. We can think of a lot of properties, as Mister Harrison indicated in that area that the farmers and stuff could take advantage of this", "esg_v1": [{"name": "County Planning and Zoning Department", "insights": [{"observation": "There is potential for many conflicts between planning and zoning across the entire county because of how the current law is written.

Lastly, I previously testified the council should not support the originally proposed language or the amendments thereto concerning the CGO zone requiring a special exception approval for residential zones in the CGO zone on properties less than 25 acres as it does not agree with the purposes of the zone which incentivizes a mixture of uses. The third purpose specific of the zone that referred reads, quote, to accommodate higher density residential uses as a part of the vertically and horizontally mixed use development as a primary replacement for the former MXT zone, a less restrictive alternative would be required that development in the CGO zone provide a mixture of two uses that would mean be consistent with the general plan and the master plan. Thank you for your time and consideration. Thank you Mister Horn, Miss Bartolomeo, followed by Mister Patel and then Sue Ellen Ferguson. Hi, Kathy Bartolomeo from Greenville. The county has already has allowed developers nearly five and a half years to adapt and prepare for the new ordinance. An extension for more time is unwarranted. More time with two sets of rules creates confusion. Many development projects have already adapted and worked with the new ordinance. Plus, a new ordinance will help with development to be near our infrastructure, saving the county money. We're already paying for many hours of overtime. In 2022, county firefighters reported 40,000 hours of maintenance, mandatory overtime. We also have many hours of overtime for the police and the county is paying more for this. We do not need an additional two year extension for using the old ordinance. And as for discouraging housing development, no one's doing that. We just need smart development in 2024. April, just a week and a half ago, NOAA scientists are investigating the possibility that climate change is causing wetlands to give off increasing methane emissions in a feedback loop and the article is titled no sign of greenhouse gases increases slowing in 2023 and much of PG county, as you know, is wetlands. How are you going to offset the greenhouse gases from the 160 generators? Need to run weekly. Data centers should not be placed on agricultural land or green zones. We're going to need these spaces. We also need to protect residents from the centers noise, lights and impacts of air pollution caused by the diesel energy generators. How will we offset the greenhouse gas created must be planned into these centers. Communities must have input regarding data centers location. And as far as Mister Gibbs saying, seeing the buildings, that is not the problem. It's the noise and the pollution and the lights. Will data centers pay their full share of taxes? Or will this add to more burden to our challenging budget? And will the electric grid, how will that priority be set? Will it be fair? Labor conditions in place? What about the CPCN? Certificate of public convenience and necessity. So please oppose an extension to these timelines. Thank you. Thank you. Where was I? Mister Patel. Then Miss Ferguson. And then Mister Haller. Good afternoon. Thank you, council, for the opportunity to speak here, representing the BAPS hindu temple in Beltsville. We've been at this property for 25 years now, and I'd want to say that we're in support of amendment two. When it comes to data centers in rr zones and being at least or 500ft from the dwelling. There is two main reasons for this, and there's science behind it and reality. The first, which some of us have addressed here, the environmental impact. There's been studies done in the recent years to show, you know, stating even Portland State University did a study about eight years ago on the nitrogen dioxide emissions from these data centers. And the closest, you know, they measured was 300 meters, and as far as 3000 meters of nitrogen dioxide emissions, as well as, you know, 2.5 micrometer particulate matter. Right, as we have seen on masks, you know, PM 2.5 that is emitted by these data centers. And the second issue is noise. And no matter how much dampening the reality is, it creates more than 60 decibels of noise just to run the h vac units, the fans and the generators. And at the lowest it can be 48 decibels. And that low humming wave, actually, our brain's not able to ignore it the way it's set up. There's a science behind it. And so we're in support for amendment too. We've been here for 25 years. I have been here through my youth for the last 20 years, and I've also spent some of my life in northern Virginia, where I've seen enough data centers envelop and proliferate across the board right next to housing developments, and have experienced it personally. And so I thank you for the opportunity to speak today and would like to say that, you know, the 500ft is probably a minimum, if not much more, based on what science says. Thank you for your opportunity and consideration. Thank you.

Thank you for your opportunity and consideration. Thank you. Mister Patel. Under two minutes. Even better. Miss Ferguson, Mister haller and Mister Robinson. Good afternoon. Sue Ellen Ferguson here on behalf of the Town of University park and thank you for hearing us today. The town has submitted a letter concerning two amendments, one that has been made and one that is being requested. The first is to support councilmember Olson's amendment number one to 27 4205 E six, to allow the MUTC zone to continue in the town of Riverdale park as an adjacent neighbor to Riverdale park. It is the town's experience that the MUTC zone has been responsibly administered and is an asset for development in that community. The second issue has to do with the amendments to section 16 oh 327 1603 and 20 716 oh seven. These two amendments affect properties that are close to the Town of University park that are currently owned by the state through the University of Maryland. What the proposal is now is to adopt a new procedure entirely for determining what the zoning will be for those properties if transferred to a private entity. And because it's a new procedure and it has not discussed in any of the materials that are on your website or any of the reports that came from planning board, etcetera, the town was concerned that it was not really aware of what is really being proposed there and is desirous of having very specific requirements for public notice and for the criteria that will be applied. And so that is a request from the town that an amendment be adopted to make those, the criteria more specific, possibly to follow a procedure that is already in place and well known to all of us, such as a ZMA procedure. That would be something that would tell the public, tell the town governments more of what they can expect in terms of any request for any action on rezoning, which is an automatic referral to the district council. Thank you very much. Thank you, Miss Ferguson. We'll look to Mister Olson to bring something forward. Thank you, Miss Ferguson, for bringing that up, and we will be addressing that. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you, mister chairman, for accommodating me. I was in a planning board hearing and I will not extend your committee hearing very long. First of all, I want to testify briefly. By the way, my name is Thomas Haller. I'm a tournament officer Largo, and I'm going to speak on behalf regarding two of the proposed amendments. The first amendment that I wanted to speak on is the one related to restricting residential uses in the CGO zone. I testified with regard to this earlier on CB 15, and the proposal to require a special exception is clearly going to have a chilling effect on the ability of and willingness of development to pursue residential development in the CGO zone. But I also want to comment on the language in the amendment. The way the amendment is now written, if you own a parcel of land, say you own a five acre parcel of land and it's surrounded by or even across the road, from other land in the CGO zone that equals 25 acres, you would be prohibited from developing your property. It's written very broadly and will have a much greater impact than simply requiring a special exception on parcels of land less than 25 acres, because it would actually ban residential development if there is an assemblage of land of 25 acres or more that is contiguous or across the road from one another. So we think that's a very big problem with regard to the amendment. The second thing I want to speak about are the transitional provisions. As you know, we've been working since the zoning ordinance was first adopted to try to improve the transitional provisions to protect the investments that property owners have made in the county over the past many years. While the transitional provisions are a vast improvement over the current provisions in the zoning ordinance, and are also a vast improvement over what is in the original version of CB 15, there's still some work to do. But we can't thank Parkland planning in for working with us and understanding some of the concerns that we have. And while I support Mister Tedesco's proposed amendment to the transitional provisions, the rest of the provisions are an incredible improvement and we urge the council to adopt them. There are still some issues with regard to the ordinance that we've discussed, but we look forward to continuing to work with you and work with Parkum planning as we move forward to make this the best zoning ordinance we possibly can. Thank you very much. Thank you. Mister Haller. Well under three minutes, mister. Robinson. John Robinson. Followed by Jill Oliver. Followed by Tony Barrett. Yes, thank you, Mister chair. My name is John Robinson. I live in Adelphi, Maryland. I am curious as to what the long term goal is for the county.

My name is John Robinson. I live in Adelphi, Maryland. I am curious as to what the long term goal is for the county. Are we focused on the quality of life for the people that are living here now, or are we primarily concerned about the profits and economic well being of the development community? What is the end point that we're looking at? Do we want this to look like Rockville pike now, or Brooklyn or Manhattan? I mean, at some point you're limited by the geographical extent of the county and what sacrifices to quality of life will be necessary to accommodate all of this growth. There's a quote by Kenneth Boulding that I like to repeat. If you believe in the infinite growth of anything real on a finite planet, you're either a fool or an economist. And this is. He was an economist himself. And this is because classical economics assumes that you can have infinite growth growth. And the implications of that assumption for the sustainability of our communities, our state and our planet should be of concern to all of us. Getting into the details, I couldn't help but notice that in the most recent planning staff report that the changes on some of the changes of position have been come about where some of the amendments that were originally opposed are now supported. And it would be interesting to know what deliberations were carried out to cause this change in positions and what facts were considered to come to them. And I've been at this since the late 1970s. And so my question is, where will the public have meaningful input that can actually change the results of what's going on? I mean, the developers are always at the table. They actually get paid to meet with park and planning. The rest of us are volunteers just trying to protect the quality of life in our communities and hopefully the rest of the county. And what protections are there in the zoning bill against false and unfounded assertions by developers and their consultants? In seeking zoning changes, I've been involved in situations where areas that were clearly wetlands were delineated as highlands, and that went through this was the Erco property, where they now have millions of dollars worth of infrastructure and buildings built. That whole area could fill up like a bathtub if you had another hurricane Agnes coming up the Chesapeake Bay, and you'd have millions of dollars in losses. I've been in special exception hearings where the developer's consultant made assertions about whether or not the special exception would have a greater impact at this particular location than other ones in the county. And their consultant couldn't even identify other rr zones in the county in our particular case. So basically they were just making an assertion with no data, no analysis. And where are those kinds of malfeasance going to be held accountable? I mean, I see nothing that deals with that in the. In the current legislation. And then what protections are there for communities that are, and who has liability for communities that are impacted by flooding that's caused by new development? I mean, this is going to be getting only worse with climate change. And where is that taken into account? Who pays when somebody suffers damage? And how are we going to protect our agricultural land if we keep eating it? It's just like moths attacking a wool code. We're nibbling away at it here and there and everywhere. If you look at the satellite images of the county over the years, you can see the dramatic changes that have taken place, the loss of forest cover, the loss of agricultural land, the loss of green space. What impact is that having on our lives? I mean, what's the value of a master plan if it can be overridden by zoning text amendments. And just to look at some of the assertions about the effort to constrain development of housing in the CGO zone, to hear the developers talk about it, you're banning multifamily housing outside the beltway. But if you simply look at all the other zones that allow multifamily housing, you can see that those are scattered around the county. So it's not like we're banning high density housing outside the beltway, although that might be dissolved. Desirable if you wanted to protect green space. Mister Robinson, I will wrap up more time than anyone else. I'm sorry. All right. Thank you. Miss Oliver and Tony Barrett, Sean Sahar. Good afternoon, council members. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak. I have to say I agree with all of the points that the prior speaker made. They were right on point. This is an issue. All these amendments and all these changes do not support what residents have said they wanted time and time again.

All right. Thank you. Miss Oliver and Tony Barrett, Sean Sahar. Good afternoon, council members. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak. I have to say I agree with all of the points that the prior speaker made. They were right on point. This is an issue. All these amendments and all these changes do not support what residents have said they wanted time and time again.

We at Fairwood have been subject to these decisions that have cost our community not only resources, but lives. We have experience with development that is not well thought out, not well planned, and not well executed. And the results have been very, very terrible for our community because we have had residents that have been killed due to poor traffic planning, poor development. We are not against development. We want smart development. We want the development that is congruent and supportive of existing communities like Fairwood. We want to see that become the priority and the consideration for the council. We have been at Fairwood subject to these, what I would say, dishonest text amendments that have had serious consequences to our community. We are tired of constantly showing up here and explaining what the impact is and everyone nodding their head and they seem to understand. But then as we leave out the door, the developers priorities become the council's priorities. We are the ones that are paying tax taxes. We are the ones that are invested in this community and in this county. And our concerns need to be the priority of this council. So to that end, let's do better. Let's do better. Listen to your constituents, because we're watching you and we're tired of coming here every time. Thank you, Attorney Barrett. Sean Shahar. Greg Smith. And then our final speaker is Dan Smith. Like the Smith brothers, cough drops good afternoon. I'm Tony Barrett and I am a resident of Prince George's county for the last 71 years. I live in a little community called Lincoln and I don't come before you today with prepared texts to speak to you about it, but I come to you with the perspective of someone that's directly affected by the amendment that council Olson has proposed. I'm coming here today to support council Olson's second proposed amendment regarding non conforming lots. The little community Lincoln is a rural resident, is zoned rural residential and it's zoned that way. That's what the residents want. We built our house on two lots which we were required to buy 40 years ago, and now there's some that are saying that you can buy, you can build a lot on less amount. As someone is directly affected, I understand that the changes were made in the new zoning ordinance that went through in February and it went through without us paying the amount of attention to it that we should have. To be honest with you, I think we all wanted to just make sure that it was still zone rural residential and we didn't look any further. But as someone came and started the process of trying to build on a small lot next to us, we started making comments and calls to our county officials and departments and no one heard us. We kept saying that our community 25 years ago had put in a grandfather clause that was approved by the council so that the requirement for our community was a lot of at least 10,000 sqft. No one heard. Everyone gave us black and white answers. Well, it's not just a black and white problem. Let me give you my specific problem. The lot next to me is less than 5000 sqft. It is shaped in the shape of a pie like that. How can you build a decent house on a lot that size and that shape? And that's not the only lot that's affected. There are many lots in our community. We just want you to see that it's not a black and white issue. And we support what council Oselman did because he listened to us. We went from department to department to department and no one listened. But Councilman Olson. Thank you. Listened and he's put in this amendment. We support it and we ask that you support it also. It is affecting our community, it's affecting our quality of life. And we just ask that you support the amendment also. Thank you for the opportunity to talk. I really enjoyed it. Thank you. Thank you. Miss Barrett, Mister Sahar, Mister Smith and Mister Smith. Good morning, Mister chair, committee members. My name is Sean Suhar, and I'm an attorney with the firm of Nagel and Zaller. I thank you for allowing me to be heard. I'm here at the request of one of my clients, Wingate Homeowners association, which is located in Glendale. If you remember, many people were critical of the new zoning ordinance under CB 13 2018 because it took the community's already limited role and further reduced it. Almost all the county, all that the county council and planning board consider in the process, the development process are preliminary plans, a subdivision, detailed site plans and specific design plans. But the community, members of the community have no meaningful role during the review of these plans. For many years, council members assisted the development industry to circumvent the zoning map amendment process by supporting specific text amendments. The main reason that we now are that we are now supporting the new ordinance is that CB 220 23, in a sense, reined in site specific text amendments. CB 320 23 gave people a voice because for once, the master plan matters and CB 15 2023 proposed limiting unplanned high density residential development sprawl. Without a provision for master plan consistency for site plan detailed site plans, the public has effectively no opportunity for meaningful engagement.

Almost all the county, all that the county council and planning board consider in the process, the development process are preliminary plans, a subdivision, detailed site plans and specific design plans. But the community, members of the community have no meaningful role during the review of these plans. For many years, council members assisted the development industry to circumvent the zoning map amendment process by supporting specific text amendments. The main reason that we now are that we are now supporting the new ordinance is that CB 220 23, in a sense, reined in site specific text amendments. CB 320 23 gave people a voice because for once, the master plan matters and CB 15 2023 proposed limiting unplanned high density residential development sprawl. Without a provision for master plan consistency for site plan detailed site plans, the public has effectively no opportunity for meaningful engagement. From what I understand, applications have been at high levels and so we oppose the two year extension of use of the prior ordinance. The council is paving the way for lower quality development. It should say something that the development industry is here in numbers this morning and that they have chosen, they choose the prior ordinance. I've personally seen this on several applications by developers directly affecting Wingate Homeowners association and affecting one of my other clients, Gabriel's run homeowners association. Developers are attempting to develop by right higher density development, bringing higher traffic volumes to neighborhoods such as Wingate and Gabriel's Run HOA, for example, 300s, even 600 apartments or 200 townhouses, all on properties that are zoned. Re and RR in regards to the proposal to require residential developments in the CGO zone outside of the beltway to obtain a special exception, we support that amendment, but it wouldn't be considered a townhouse ban. First, the zones were folded into the CGO zone, did not allow for residential development, and second, the zoning ordinance has over a dozen other zones that allow townhouses, two over two townhouses and multifamily. So there's no short of shortage of locations for dense residential development throughout the county. So in conclusion, if I may, I know I'm past the time Mister chair high dense. It would be unfair to characterize as extreme the committee's desire to have a meaningful opportunity to speak to the potential impacts when CGO properties are scattered outside the Beltway seeking high density development. If CB 15 2024 is enacted with the amendments, which we oppose, the council is saying that it would not value meaningful community development, that it wouldn't care about the plan 2020 three's growth policies, sprawl development, and they wouldn't care about the continuing history of accepting lower quality development. Thank you very much. Thank you. Craig Smith. Dan Smith thank you Mister chair, Madam vice chair, and committee members and non committee members who are here as well. My name is Greg Smith. For the record, I live at 4204 Farragut street in Hyattsville. I serve on the board of Sustainable Hyattsville, but I testify as an individual here today. Also for the record, I received no compensation or pay of any kind to be here to participate in these proceedings, as been the case every time I've been before the council in the past, as opposed to a number of folks in the room with respect to the various amendments proposed. Again, I oppose the extension to two years of the developers access to the old zoning ordinance and the old subdivision regulations. They have had five and a half years to adapt. Hell, they wrote part of the new zoning ordinance. The new zoning ordinance further weakens. I mean, we already had the public right to know and public right to participate and have meaningful say. Provisions in the old zoning ordinance were weak enough, they're weaker in the new ordinance. But there are some good pieces to the new ordinance that are meant to do something, something to begin to do something to contain sprawl in the county. The general plan has a number of policies and goals that are meant to contain sprawl in the county, and they're there for a reason. There are also a number of provisions that are meant to deal with climate change there for a reason. But here we are ten years later. We've passed a pretty good climate action plan but taking no actions to implement it nearly two years after it was first proposed and adopted. With respect to and the planning board shift on that two year extension provision, the reasoning is kind of odd. They basically said, well, we're going to go ahead and support the two years now because that would be consistent with the position that we opposed before. That's not a policy driven or a principle driven position, it's a capitulation. With respect to the CGO amendments. Here we are. We're three weeks after we first. Since a number of folks in the public first raised concern about allowing intensive residential, townhouse and apartment development on CGO properties three weeks after that, we raise a concern. We also raised concern about the absolute lack of any analysis of the potential impacts of that policy change. And yet here we have no analysis. Still, this is not a trivial issue. And the question isn't whether or not you like townhouses or apartments. I've lived in a townhouse. They're fine. They're necessary in some places. But we also need really solid analysis of where we end up if we adapt, if we adopt, or if you adopt these amendments to CB 15 and to the zoning ordinance. Otherwise, we're flying blind. And if you proceed down this path, you're essentially saying you're fine with flying blind. And I think that most of you are not. I think most of you care very much about the fate of the county, not just for this generation, but for future generations.

The compromise would allow between five special exceptions to, to enable between 500 and 1200 units on a 25 acre property with no impact analysis. So I hope you at least ask for that before you approve this. I'll just finish up real quickly with respect to the data centers. In 2014, I was invited to travel to Ann Arbor to participate in an exercise. It was a joint exercise for the University of Maryland and the University of Michigan school, Schools of Public Health, where they were looking at what are the kind of environmental restrictions, what are the kind of environmental protections we want to give our school children. So with respect to the data center setbacks, I would say keep it at least 500ft, but also add schools and parks and other places where people spend substantial amounts of time, especially children, and look not only at the noise impacts, but also at the air pollution and public health impacts. These are pretty serious. I've worked on that issue. Air pollution impacts on public health, including especially children, for a long time, mostly in the context of high waste, but also with respect to point sources. It's a big deal. So please provide setbacks. The revised amendment looks like. I'll just finish real quickly. Mister chair looks like spy, which I understand the courts consider to be illegal. I understand the desire to locate data centers, but this looks like illegal spot zoning potentially. But then the other concern was with the broader bill was again, we had no map of the potential sites and no analysis of potential impacts. Thank you. Thank you. And last speaker is Mister Smith. Then we'll deal with these amendments. Thank you. Dan Smith from Cheverly. My question really is one that's been brought up here before, but my real question is where in the development process is there now and how and where in the future will there be meaningful public input, input from communities, and I mean meaningful, not just for specific properties and projects. That's what the whole zoning process is about, but also for the rulemaking process and the deliberation which has occurred. Once again, I would like to point out here, I think this is at least the third hearing that we've had in some form for these proposals and amendments. There has been not one public representative, an individual, not one organization or community association that has come here in support of these controversial proposals. Not one over the past. A main reason that the civic environmental leaders are now supporting the new ordinance were the bills passed last year on site to limit site specific text amendments, to give voice to the people through master plans that might matter. And that gave us some hope that there would be an opportunity to limit dense residential development sprawl. The data is clear that without a provision for master plan consistency, the public has effectively no opportunity for meaningful engagement. The data is also clear that the bill passed last year has not slowed development in the lease. The. The applications have been at historic levels and are on pace this year to be the most application since plan 2035 was approved. There are no shortages vocations for dense residential development through the county. And we want development, we need it. And we understand that density is critical to creating demand and for quality commercial development. But that's not what we're seeing with these proposals. We're seeing a continuation of the momentum that will continue sprawl development, which is bleeding the budget. It's not creating new financial opportunities, or at least it's. It's only momentarily plugging a hole. I would just like to conclude by saying that it's rather alarming to learn here today, just the intensity of the conversations and the work that's been going on in the last two weeks between park and planning and the development community. Park and planning has, by the admission of the development community and others here today, has met with and incorporated substantial proposals from the development community and their representatives on a wide range of topics. Of course they should have input, but not exclusive. Where was the community in these? Was there an invitation to meet with the community, either with, together or separately? There was not. And I just have to conclude that because of that, I just. And not only were those proposals about the process, but they were for specific properties. And then we hear, so they were presenting specific properties and now coming here making assertions that, for example, putting data centers, changing the regulations of data centers in the ag zones will benefit. Mister Smith, I think we're wrapped up. They will benefit the Glendale Hospital center where isn't they? Glendale community to affirm that? I don't think they're aware of that. So I think the planning staff, it's really. Are you looking out for the people?

I would urge you to get back to integrity and working with and for the people. Okay. That concludes the public comment. Yeah, we're out of time. I wanted to move to the amendments. Mister Olson, do you want to say something about. Yeah, thank you, Miss Ferguson. Brought up on behalf of the town of University park the very good observation about when land is conveyed by the University of Maryland. So I would direct this to Mister Williams. Lines three and four on page four of CB 15 requires a public hearing for the council's proposed mandatory zoning review of property conveyances by the US or the state to a private party. The public hearing would be advertised in accordance to section 27 3407. But when the bill proposes to notify the public pursuant to that, which specific part of 27 3407 does that refer to? I think we need to make sure that this follows the established program, the established way of with public processes and whatnot. Like a zoning map amendment kind of thing. Mister Williams, do you have comment or a solution to that? Yes sir. Perhaps both. So I'm looking at that provision now. Let me bring that back up because I went to the code. Well, I'm in both, but I'm looking at the lines that the council member referenced and it does indeed. There's a proposal for this review to be conducted by a public hearing coordinates with that table or that section. So that section consists of a table that contains all the public notification requirements for each application type in the ordinance. And because there are so many. Yes, there is some uncertainty here. So if the council member and the committee were so inclined for full clarity, you might want to consider an amendment to lines three and four on page four. That the review shall be conducted at a public hearing advertised in accordance with the district council's zoning map amendment procedures of section 27 3407, scheduling of hearings and public notice. And that'll make it very clear that you mimic the same process for any zoning map amendment for the zoning review in terms of your notification. Okay. Thank you. I would like us to have that prepared in accordance with what Mister Williams has said. I think that clarifies everything. I mean, we need to make sure that the public understands exactly what is going on and how it's done. It's not just some new process. So we do need to follow established procedure. So I don't think we're going to vote on that particular thing today. So we do have a little bit of time, but. Yeah. Thank you, mister chair. Yes. All right, I want to move to the amendments, the first amendment that I'd like us. Mister. They need Mister Franklin. We're going to put. I think he's here. Do we have Mister Franklin? There's Mister Franklin. Okay. Yes. I can barely hear you, mister chair. I'm asking them to turn your volume up a little bit. What was your question? Okay, Miss McNeil. Okay, very quickly, I could be in 3 seconds and I don't have the. You're on binder, so I apologize for that. But you have a bill involving qualified data centers that. It's a technical, but it's important. On the second page, it starts with the sentence, quote, qualified data centers shall not be permitted in. And then you add something along that portion of the innovation corridor. So I would. On this bill, could we just work on the grammar? I know it sounds funny to you, but this is important to me and all the nuns that raised me in elementary school. But that doesn't mean. That's the language. Just to be clear, Miss McNeil, when you question, and you made a point of highlighting with, do you mean along you would prefer word? No, I'm just saying that whatever shall not be permitted. If you got rid of. You know what that fits it. If you just got rid of the. I'm talking grammar and don't even know what you call this. What is it? Preposition. Yeah, and just start with a long. That probably takes care of my issue. I don't even know if I have that. So we'll work on that part. That. Really? Yeah, and then the bill. And this is more substantive, the bill involving this. What is it? This CGO zone with a special exception. And the. It is Mister Donovas. Let's not worry about that. Okay. All right. We'll worry about that one. And then the last one. That's not it.

This is the transition rule amendment, taking awareness of the comments from the zoning bar. But I think we need to talk to park and planning because it seems like that's going to have some implications. I think we need to figure that out. Not on the fly here. So I'd like to move the amendment as drafted, but when we bring it back, we can check into whether we agree with the impact of that revision. Just to move things along, I'm going to make a motion. I'd like a second, if any, discussion, the one we talked about. So for now, it would be incorporated for purposes of making an inline proposed draft two with whatever gets voted in today. Correct. The idea is to come back with the draft two at our next meeting for all the whatever we do today. But we will still leave space for amendments because we got to pick up Mister Harrison's RPD we got to deal with. Right. So we're gonna have a couple things between now and the next meeting that we need to pick up on. And I want to include on that list this request from the industry about. No. Yes. Okay. I thought you meant not conformulating, seeing no further discussion. I'm just trying to catch up on this one because I haven't heard a lot of discussion about. This is the one we met on Monday and agreed to. They've got to change. But I don't do the change now because we don't know what that change means. But I'm not saying no. Just tell me one more time. Day. Madam Clerk, please call the roll chair. Donega. Aye. Vice chair Ivey? Aye. Councilmember Franklin? I vote aye. Councilmember Hawkins? Madam Clerk? I vote aye. Councilmember Olson? Aye. Motion carries 50. The next amendment I want to move is my amendment on the buffer for the places of worship. And, and I would just say on this amendment that when we took when we two things when we, because I was one of the sponsors of the original data center bills that allowed by right, go straight to building permit data centers in RR zones. We didn't know some of the things we know now about, literally shortly after we adopted those, then we started hearing about fumes and noise and we did not include places of worship. And we had a request specifically from a place of worship I want to acknowledge, I want to support their 500 foot for the places of worship. So I want to start with that. I hope we can do that. And that's the motion, if I can. 2nd. 2nd. Any discussion? Seeing none. Madam Clerk, please call the roll chair. Done. Vice chair Ivey. Aye. Council member Franklin? Aye. Councilmember Hawkins. Madam Clerk, I'll vote aye. Councilmember Olson? Aye. Motion carries 50. Next, I want to do Mister Harrison's amendment on data centers in the AG zone, which has been revised a couple times. There's two revisions. I will call for the committee at your convenience, if desired. This is on. Well, the current virtual binder version is on for anyone following along. It is located on page 644 of the virtual binder. And based on some testimony that their committee heard today, I've been advised by makers of the proposed amendment that there are some tweaks. Both occur on page two of this proposed amendment. The proposed amendment, of course, deals with the regulations that would apply to qualified data centers in the AG zone, as styled. This amendment states that. And this begins in line 19. On page two of the proposed amendment it talks about on line 23, it says at least 300ft from any residential use. The testimony we heard today, which Vice chair Harrison exactly has instructed me that he endorses, is to strike 300 in line 23. And. Oh, I'm sorry. Can you hear me now? To strike the figure 300 in line 23 and substitute 200. And when it says residential use, strike, use and say dwelling unit, what page are we on? It's in the virtual binder. Page 645. This is page two of the amendment. Specifically, line 23. Okay. And then there was one. Was there one other thing? Hold on a second. Yes, okay. And then on the following page, which is just a little snippet of additional language, the original proposed one, a QDC language, has on lines four and five. On page three of the proposed amendment, page 646 of your virtual binder, there's a requirement that there be noise mitigation to meet residential standards. Instead of blanket citing, the pollution subtitle which covers noise pollution in subtitle 19 of your code. The suggestion I agree with it is to say section 19 122 in lieu of just subtitle 19. That way it's a little more accurate and anyone who's interested in what the requirements are can turn right to it, as opposed to flicking through the entire pollution ordinance. All right, so with those three tweaks, that is my understanding that that is the way the amendment should be considered. All right, thank you. Can I ask a question? Sure. Wait a second. Discussion. Go ahead. Mister Barkers, earlier I asked you about an amendment that I believe, Attorney Gibbs, you and the planning board have been working with. Did that ever get resolved? This is it. Okay. Need a motion. Mister chair, I would like to make a favorable motion on the amendment. Second, we have a motion and a second. Any discussion on the motion? Seeing none.

Madam clerk, call the roll chair Danoga. Well, I started off being opposed to this because of the impact on the rural tier, but it's been modified. I think I'll abstain, but I appreciate the sponsor narrowing the impact. Thank you Mister. Mister Harrison. Mayor Ivey. Hi. Councilmember Franklin? I vote aye. Councilmember Hawkins? Madam Clerk, I vote aye in explaining my vote. Thank you Mister Harrison, for bringing this forward, but I think as we move forward we have to be very considerate of the environmental and the public safety issues. Thanks, Councilmember Olson. Motion carries, 302. Thank you. Next, we're going to have Mister Olson's amendment regarding the MUTC zone for Riverdale park move favorable, 2nd second the motion and a second by Miss Ivey. Any discussion? Seeing none. Madam Clerk, please call. Call the roll chair. Doneoga. Aye. Vice chair Ivey? Aye. Councilmember Franklin. Aye. Councilmember Hawkins? Madam Clerk, I vote aye. Councilmember Olson? Aye. Motion carries. 50. Okay, next we have Mister Olson and chair Ivey's amendment regarding development on nonconforming lots. The Lincoln Vista bill move favorable?

In explaining my vote. I also have had properties that have been impacted by this and im glad were able to stop it in this way. Councilmember Franklin. Hello, die Councilmember Hawkins. Madam clerk, a vote aye. Council member Olson? Aye. Motion carries, 50. Okay, so we're going to hold Mister Harrison's RPD Ar amendment if you would like to speak for a second. Mister chair, I thank you for considering this piece of legislation today on the amendment, but you know, I do want to give time to miss hall and Maryland National Capitol park and planning to review it. I also like to see the map of what other districts might be impacted, whether it's your district mister chair or council member begay as well. And then being able to come back around. The intentionality of this was just to, you know, make sure that our legacy farmers that are in the AR zone, who are surrounded by dense development in an established communities growth policy area because of the CMA, were effectively downsized and properties potentially devalued. And so just trying to make the fairness and equity in that process as well. So basically that's what. But I'm trying the overall genesis of it, trying to make sure that our legacy farmers are represented in that way as well. Okay, thank you Mister Harrison. My other amendment on CGO will just hold for now. There's not the will to move forward. So we'll turn to Mister Franklin's master plan conformity amendment. And if Mister Franklin wants to speak to that. Thank you, mister chair. I guess. I guess the protocol is to move it and then go to discussion. Is that right? Yeah. I don't know if you want to speak to it first as the sponsor. I mean, it's not a bill, but sure, we can make a. Make a motion. So I'll just. Just to get. Just to get it on the. To keep things in order. I'll just move faith. I'll move favorable on the members, not, the members aren't numbered, so I'll move favorable on this particular amendment. Madam Chair, I'll do a second on that discussion. Okay. And I know there's disagreement about this, and that's okay. It's part of the process. I wanted to just explain so the purpose and why this amendment is being put in. It won't surprise anyone who saw the debate. CB 320 23. Last year I was opposed to CB three, and I'll get into the reasons why, but this amendment basically repeals CB 320 23. I think there's broad agreement that making the implementation of master plans and sector plans more important in development outcomes is very important. I don't think there's any disagreement about that. The disagreement is around what is the right way to go about it. As I said, this amendment repeals CB 320 23, which last year changed the new zoning ordinance that we just passed in 2022 to require specific uses to be determined whether they're permitted. It required a determination of whether specific uses are permitted or not at the time of detailed site plan and special exception based on conformity with the last master plan or sector plan for that area. The planning board approached CB 320 23 and the zone hearing examiner, Miss McNeil, raised some serious concerns about it. And I'll get into that as well. My comments are going to closely echo the comments of the planning board last year and this week, specifically in regard to detail site plan. Detailed site plan is the wrong stage of the process to determine whether specific uses should be permitted in accordance with the master plan or sector plan, because it's near the end of the development review process and that kind of uncertainty should not exist at that stage of the process about whether certain uses are permitted or not. That determination shoul", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Unknown Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Thank you Mister. Mister Harrison. Mayor Ivey. Hi. Councilmember Franklin? I vote aye.

The planning board approached CB 320 23 and the zone hearing examiner, Miss McNeil, raised some serious concerns about it. And I'll get into that as well. My comments are going to closely echo the comments of the planning board last year and this week, specifically in regard to detail site plan. Detailed site plan is the wrong stage of the process to determine whether specific uses should be permitted in accordance with the master plan or sector plan, because it's near the end of the development review process and that kind of uncertainty should not exist at that stage of the process about whether certain uses are permitted or not. That determination should occur at the time of comprehensive planning and zoning, which is the sector plan or master plan and sectional map amendment stage, which is both at the beginning of the development process and includes, because I know this has come up today, meaningful and robust community input and involvement into what uses are appropriate for properties in that area. That approach creates certainty for the development process for the community and applicants. Further, and again, I'm using the planning board's own thoughts here regarding both detailed site plans and special exceptions. The planning board notes that a key purpose of most master plans and sector plans is to recommend appropriate zoning for specific properties or groups of properties, which are then implemented in the sectional map amendment, which I mentioned earlier. But the planning board then notes, and I quote, many earlier plans, meaning master plans and sector plans contain recommendations that are not consistent with plan 2035 and are not consistent with the zoning imposed by the countywide map amendment that implemented plan 2035. Requiring conformance without daily plans at the DSP stage will generate many unresolvable conflicts between an outdated plan, plan 2035, and the property's current zoning. And Miss McNeil's comments also echoed that as related to special exceptions. And to put a finer point on it, and again, I'm not going to belabor this. I'm going to get back to Florida. 93% of the county's current master plans and sector plans predate the effective date of the zoning rewrite and the countywide map amendment. 93%. So none of those plans could have recommended zones that they didn't know were going to exist. 84%. If you want to even go further, 84% of the current master plans and sector plans even predate the adoption of the general plan known as plan 2035 in 2014. So obviously, they couldn't recommend conformance with plan 2035 because it didn't exist yet. Yet. CB 320 23 last year says, oh, but we're gonna have, we're gonna require conformance, which is very little wiggle room with recommendations that 93% of them didn't even recommend the zones that we have today because they predate the new zoning rewrite, and 84% of them predate plan 2035. That's the reason I'm putting this amendment in, to restore the language that the planning board recommended and we adopted in the new zoning rewrite. I believe that's the best way to have a more orderly development review process, to have a process that doesn't introduce, certainly near the end of the process, and which emphasizes public and community, and put more on the front end of the process in the comprehensive planning, which is master plans and sector plans and SMA enactment. So that is the purpose of my amendment. Thank you, mister chair. Thank you, Mister Franklin. I have one data question. How many detailed site plans have been rejected since CB three came into play? I'm not aware of any. I haven't looked. To be honest, the best answer is I haven't looked. Mister Bharlaj, do you know? Okay. Second, but I would tell you this, that I'm aware of a project that doesn't require a DSP, so we can talk about it, which is the data center project for land to land over mall site, that project only required a preliminary planner subdivision. However, had that project required a detailed site plan, arguably it could have been disapproved, because the recommendation for that site, which is from many, many, many, many years ago, certainly does not recommend anything related to data centers. Any further discussion? Madam Clerk, please call the roll chair Dunoga. I'm going to strongly vote no, and I'm going to address my reasons. Mister Franklin said a lot of things that are correct, but there's another spin to this, and it's not spin, it's just reality. The public gets to speak on the uses at comprehensive zoning and at zoning map amendments. That's the only time they really have a say. Well, we've only done eight zoning map amendments in the last six or seven years. As Mister Franklin pointed out, we don't do master plans at sectional map amendments, so the public has literally no place to have a meaningful say ever. And this council went on a tear for many years doing site specific text amendments to take away the opportunity to even have a zoning map amendment case. So the council as a whole, not. Not necessarily this council, but just over the last 20 years, we've allowed the circumvention the zoning process. So if the public doesn't get master plans, section map amendments in front of them to comment on, if they don't get zoning map amendments, when do they get to speak? They can get a detailed site plan, but a detailed site plan. It's about landscaping, architecture, and things that they aren't concerned with. And if, for example, a data center came to Landever Mall and the council person for that area didn't want it, they wouldn't have any choice. So when you look at the types of cases that com", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Data Center Project at Landever Mall Site", "insights": [{"observation": "Had that project required a detailed site plan, arguably it could have been disapproved, because the recommendation for that site, which is from many, many, many, many years ago, certainly does not recommend anything related to data centers.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Data Center Project at Landever Mall Site", "insights": [{"observation": "Had that project required a detailed site plan, arguably it could have been disapproved, because the recommendation for that site, which is from many, many, many, many years ago, certainly does not recommend anything related to data centers.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 10573600, "chunk_end_time": 10999040, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3489?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3489?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=10573"}, {"start": 144000, "end": 150000, "text": " map amendments in the last six or seven years.

And if, for example, a data center came to Landever Mall and the council person for that area didn't want it, they wouldn't have any choice. So when you look at the types of cases that come in front of the planning board and the district council, there are preliminary plans of subdivision. They're detailed site plans. They used to be specific design plans, but those are being phased out, maybe with the changing to the new ordinance. That's about 95% of all cases. So the public is invited to have an opinion that matters on 2% or less of all zoning matters. So what we're telling the public is thanks for coming. We really don't need your opinion. So I cannot support that. This was, I thought, a critical change to let the public feel like they had a role in the zoning process and to, after letting less than one year and nobody can identify, a case has been turned down based on the master plan. I think it's crying wolf on the development industry side. So I'm finished. I cannot support this amendment. Thank you, vice chair Ivey. Hi, councilmember Franklin. I vote aye. I'm just explaining my vote. I appreciate and understand where Mister coming from. Part of why we've had so few smas and sector plans over the last several years had a pause during the time of dependency of the new zoning rewrite and county wide map amendment. So that's one of the reasons why we've had so few. I agree that we need to do a complete countywide refresh of those for the plans that have not been refreshed in the last few years, but that's part of why. And quite honestly, with the zones that were placed in the new zoning rewrite, there was a lot of public input into what those zones should look like, into what uses should be in those zones. I am quite honest, I'm a little surprised with all of the objection to the CGO zone that we're hearing now that I didn't hear back in 2018. I didn't hear from a lot of the groups that are organized today to talk about CGO. I didn't hear their objections back in 2018. The CGO zone comes from the planning board and their consultants. They came up with it. We agreed to it. We didn't hear a big backlash on the CGO zone back in 2018. But I would just say that to respond that that is in part why we've had so few master plans and smas, and that's because we had that pause for a number of years during the pendency of the zoning rewrite and CMA. But I vote out. Thank you, councilmember Hawkins. Madam Clerk, after hearing such a robust discussion between two of the brilliant members of this council. Your favorite. Two of my favorites. I vote aye. Council member Olson, after hearing the same robust discussion, I vote no. Motion carries. Okay. Thank you. We are going to. It's, it's, it's time for HHSp's. We're going to move on to CB 2724. We're good. We have another bill with a subdivision bill, CB 27. Miss Hightower, you want to give us an orientation and then we're going to have public testimony of two minutes or less. And if you've already spoken about extensions, you don't necessarily need to say it again. Miss Hightower. Yes, sir. CB 2724 is an ordinance to amend the time for applications to be approved and considered under the prior subdivision regulations for two years, from two years to four years, which is also from April 1, 2024 to April 1, 2026. We received comments from citizens and they can be found in your virtual binder. Also, the planning board supports the bill. Staff are here to address their comments. The zoning hearing examiner may have some comments. We also have Miss Angie Rogers here, DCAO for economic development, who may have some comments as well. Thank you. Thank you. I'll turn to the sponsor. Move favorable. Second, it's out of order. Respectfully, I'm sorry. We're going to the public and then you can sponsor. Well, really, if. I know I've said these comments before, so I guess I just didn't want to repeat myself. But. But we have, we have a bill before us that, the amended bill is, what? 283 pages? That's before all the amendments we're doing today. We're going to be over 300 pages of amendments. Of amendments to a bill. So anytime you have that many amendments, I think that it's pretty clear that it's not ready to be the only document that developers can rely on. I know there are citizens who believe that developers are all evil and are just trying to take advantage of the public. I don't find them to be any more or less good or evil than teachers, doctors, politicians or anyone else. People are professionals. They're trying to do a job for the most part. And although I have heard people even today say they do support good development, from what I can see in a previous class I took on commercial development, we won't have any development if we don't give some certainty to the process.

I know there are citizens who believe that developers are all evil and are just trying to take advantage of the public. I don't find them to be any more or less good or evil than teachers, doctors, politicians or anyone else. People are professionals. They're trying to do a job for the most part. And although I have heard people even today say they do support good development, from what I can see in a previous class I took on commercial development, we won't have any development if we don't give some certainty to the process. Certainty is important to me when I'm making financial and business decisions. And it's important just as much to developers. So, or maybe more so because they have more money than I do. So when it comes to wanting to have development and knowing that our county is just, we need to do better on development, we need to have more, some places for sure, then. That is why I think it's important that we have certainty, which is what I'm talking about here, that people have the ability to continue to do projects in our county for the next period of time while we work out all the bugs that we're continuing to find in this bill. I believe that Mister Smith made a comment about the public not being included in the last few days of discussion on these amendments. And I'm sure that is because when you're trying to fix a document and the people who use the document are developers, that's who you talk to. So that makes sense to me. They're the ones trying to figure out how do you put the pieces together. And so, in any event, that is why I proposed this. And I don't really think it was necessary for me to say anything else, but, you know, you gave me the mic, so there you go. Sorry about that. I did want to clarify one thing, if I may, mister chair. This is the subdivision bill. You don't need the zoning bill because you've already done the amendment by way of the amendment. I'm having trouble keeping up and Tom said. He sent me his list and I still haven't received it, but yeah, this is. This is CB 727 is a subdivision bill. Got you. Thank you. That's weird. Okay, so brief comments, two minutes or less. Mister Tedesco, Miss Gingold, Mister Antonetti, Mister Horn seems to have left. Sorry. Thank you, mister chairman. Good afternoon and I'll try to expedite this. I'll speak for Mister Antonetti, Mister Horn, with their authorization. First and foremost, Matthew Tedesco, with offices in Greenbelt. Thank you to the sponsor for advancing this bill. We hope that the committee supports it. We align ourselves with the planning board support for the bill. We would just say that Madam chair mentioned teachers, doctors, other professionals, and we would also like to include lawyers in that if we could. But in all seriousness, this bill is very important. It is the subdivision bill that allows the opportunity to have the choice provision. We have not even touched an omnibus bill for the subdivision regulations. We have spent the better part of almost two years on the omnibus bill for the zoning ordinance. These two documents need to talk to each other. It just needs more time. And so we thank the sponsor and we thank the support for this bill. Thank you. Miss Gingold. Jill Oliver. Is Jill Oliver still here? No. Hi, I'm Janet Gingold and I'm speaking on behalf of the Sierra Club. It totally makes sense that this, the subdivision regulations have to be consistent with what's in the zoning ordinance. But I just want to again reiterate our position that we don't think that we should have two more years of delay. That further puts off any the benefits that will happen with the new zoning ordinance. Continuing to allow the use of the old regulations delays the necessary change toward transit oriented development and creates unnecessary complexity and confusion. If we really need an extension because of unavoidable systemic delays, please make it shorter. We should not have new applications continue to be processed with the old system we need. If we want certainty, we should stick with the rules that we set up. Two years was enough. And okay, maybe there are things that make it unfair for people who have done all their due diligence and they thought they were in the system, but unavoidable delays have happened. Maybe you need a six month extension to allow for some of those other, those things to work their way through the system, but we should not continue to move the deadline farther and farther down the road. Thanks. Thank you. Miss Gingold. Sean Shahar. Looks like he left. So the last person we happened with, John Robinson, I think he left. Dan Smith, you're the final speaker. Yeah. Thank you. Dan Smith. Cheverly and Greg Smith had to leave and go to work. And I just. I think some of the comments really are telling. I reject that zoning ordinance and the subdivision regulations are for developers. They're for development. They're for all of us. They can't be for all of us. If the intense changes and look at problems is only one sided. And I'm sure there is a range of opinion in the development community, but unfortunately the way this has been structured is that any of the progressive developers that have bought into the new way and have done it, we're not hearing their voice.

We're going through that intensely in Cheverly, at the hospital hill, and how to do that. And it's a whole community process. So development is not at all at risk of being shut down in this county. What is at risk, I hope, is at risk is that sprawl development, the momentum from the fifties and the sixties, that needs to be altered, reined in.

Councilmember Oriada? Here. Councilmember Durnoga? Present, present or present. Thank you. And I know Councilmember Franklin will be absent today, so greetings and welcome. On today's agenda, we have six budget work sessions to review on the proposed fiscal year 2025 budget. So we'll begin with the licensed commissioners, followed by the Office of Central Services, Office of Finance, OHRM and the Revenue authority. And finally, OMB colleagues, keep in mind that today is not the last time we will have to address any questions to the agencies. So we will be working with the administration to schedule a time in September when at least two of the agencies can return for briefings. We have an ambitious agenda today, so everyone will need to be as efficient as possible with time. So we will get started with licensed commissioners. Mister Terrence shepherd, director. And our analyst today is Andrew Stover. I've turned to Mister Stover. Thank you, madam chair. Mister Vice chair, members of the committee, my name is Andrew Stover and I'm a policy analyst for the legislative Budget and policy office. As you said, I know we've got a lot on the agenda today, so my goal with these is to try and present to you what we feel is the most important information highlight and I will be happy to answer any questions or anything that anybody has if you want to know more information about the report. So, getting into the budget for Board of Licensed commissioners, this budget is proposed at $2 million, which is just slightly below the FY 2024 level of $16.7 thousand, $0.7 thousand below, or 0.8%. And what we see is that this budget increases in operating costs, technology costs and salary adjustments, but is offset by a decrease in fringe benefit funding. You can look at the expenditures and show that for compensation is proposed at about 1.3 million, which is a decrease of 3.6 thousand. And they do have two additional part time staff positions that they are still looking for. So two vacancies in that. But besides that, staffing has not experienced a lot of change. On page three you can see the revenues, a breakdown of what kind of money they're getting. It's mainly from fees and the license fees. And so for the breakdown of revenue collected from the issuing of fines, you can look at question ten of the first round responses. And for a breakdown of costs that they're charging for licenses, you can take a look at question eleven of the first round responses. Operating expenses are proposed at $288,000. The biggest line items are office automation, general and administrative contracts, and mileage reimbursements. The biggest increase that we saw was for an interpreter for $20,000 and also an increase for $11,300 for mileage reimbursement. When it comes to information technology, they do have some projects going on. There is a $500,000 project that they've got in the OIT budget that is a software that works on increasing the productivity of their issuing licenses. Finally, when it comes to workload and key points, you can find a map of the locations that have alcohol permits on attachment two of the first round responses, and you can see a breakdown on page four of the report of how many there are by county. And finally, I just wanted to say that the board continues to run its underage compliance checks to make sure that licensees are following the law and not serving to minors. That continues to be something that they're doing. And as of March 2024, sale to a minor made up 21 out of 58 violations adjudicated. That concludes my report on the board of licensed commissioners. Thank you. Thank you. Mister Stover, Mister early, did you have anything to add? I have nothing to add at this time. Thank you. Thank you. All right, I'll now turn to Mister shepherd. Thank you for being here. Thank you Madam chair and vice chair and council members.

Evening hearings consist of violations, endorsements such as delivery permits, special entertainment permits, and other matters. The administrative staff is responsible for processing all new application renewals and other administrative matters. They also schedule our hearings and collect all fees that are owed to the board. And the administrative staff is actively involved in outreach and just about the inspection staff. They are responsible for examining every licensee on a scheduled basis. The inspection staff conducts over 5700 routine inspections in the calendar year. Additional inspection consists of underage enforcement, entertainment inspection, as well as focused inspections. Here are some inspection highlights. The BLC has conducted underage compliance checks at locations that hold entertainment permits. 298 underage checks were completed. This operation resulted in 100% refusal of a licensees allowing underage individuals into their premises during restricted hours. The BOLC conducted 60 underage compliance checks so far this year at license establishments. This resulted in 30 underage violations, and this constitutes 50% of all licensees refusing to sell to underage individuals. During our biannual entertainment blitz, our inspectors conducted 45 entertainment enforcement operations. These operations resulted in zero entertainment violations. The inspection staff also conducts outreach through CMAS meetings, community meetings, and numerous workgroups with elected officials and community members. That's pretty much it. As an overview of what we do, I'm here to answer any questions that you may have about our operations or about our budget or anything that you may want to know more about. Thank you. Before we move on to questions, could you introduce your team that you brought with you today? Absolutely. Thank you. Next to me is Patti Bell. She's my budget analyst. And also seated over there on the right, Miss Alicia Hughes. She is my assistant. Thank you very much. All right, mister vice chair, did you have a question? Just wanted to thank you all for the work that you do each and every year. 5700 inspections is quite a lot per year. So the work that your inspectors do is paramount. You talked about the underage drinking and part of the complaints that you have gotten out of, what was it, 50 complaints? You've had 21 of them that were serving underage. So those are actually not complaints. That's part of our inspection process, where we have a thousand hour employees, and we also have police cadets and police explorers. We go out and we just do a routine inspection. And so far this fiscal year, we've done 60. So what we did with that, we actually got back 30 violations from that. Yeah. So what we did with that is we immediately stopped the inspections, and we did an outreach to all of our licensees, where we sent out documentation, how to properly check to let people know that we're coming, and just also, just a reminder to make sure that they're doing the right thing. So that took about three to four weeks, where we sent the mailers out. We sent inspectors out with all different types of information. Plackets to put on their windows and plackets to put on their cash registers. And typically, once we do that, the inspections, they decrease. So let me ask you this, then, Director Shep. When you talk about a violation, something of that magnitude where someone serving or underage, what is the repercussions of that, the penalties that happen behind that. So typically what happens is for a first violation, a licensee can receive up to a $1,500 fine, and the second violation is a $6,000 fine, and the third subsequent violation is 7500, and it can result in a suspension or revocation. There was new legislation that was passed this past legislative session where it took that possible suspension and revocation on the second violation. So that will be going into effect on July 1 of this year. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much, Councilmember Oriada. Thank you. Just a few questions. One, I just want to understand the difference between, I see the routine inspections, but focus inspections, because it notated that you had focused ones in 2021, but none after that. So I'm just trying to understand what the difference between the two are. So a routine inspection is, we do those on a quarterly basis. We're required to reach every single licensee at least once per quarter. Right. So focus inspections are things that we use in order to promote training on our inspectors. So anything that we see that we think that they need more, you know, they need more training, we'll detail that as a focus inspection. In addition to that, just if we notice anything in the field, for instance, trash at our liquor stores, we'll detail our inspectors to do focus inspections during that time frame. But I believe what you see is, was during the pandemic. It's probably during 2021. And we use that as another training tool, maybe was the. I'm sorry, can you show me where you are? Yes. So page 183.

So I'm just trying to understand what the difference between the two are. So a routine inspection is, we do those on a quarterly basis. We're required to reach every single licensee at least once per quarter. Right. So focus inspections are things that we use in order to promote training on our inspectors. So anything that we see that we think that they need more, you know, they need more training, we'll detail that as a focus inspection. In addition to that, just if we notice anything in the field, for instance, trash at our liquor stores, we'll detail our inspectors to do focus inspections during that time frame. But I believe what you see is, was during the pandemic. It's probably during 2021. And we use that as another training tool, maybe was the. I'm sorry, can you show me where you are? Yes. So page 183. It has focus inspections in 2021, but no focus inspections after that. Yeah. So that was. Yeah. So that was 56 focus inspections during 2021. That was during. During the pandemic? Just after the pandemic. So we were focusing on something very specific during that timeframe. It was most likely trash complaints at our liquor stores. It was called Operation Clean, where we put together a group of not only Prince George county board of licensed inspectors, but we also used DPI, fire department and police department. And we went out and we just detailed that as a focus inspection. That's what that was. And I know for myself, I'm sure some of my other colleagues, I'd be interested in seeing how we could maybe get back to doing some more focused inspections, especially in areas where we're seeing a lot of businesses where we get a lot of complaints on how they're operating. So that's just something I think I'd like to talk about offline. And then one other question around the penalties that my colleague mentioned, because when I look at the license suspension or revoked, I see zero across the board from 2021 till now. But you did talk about violations, so I guess none are leading to suspensions. Is that fair to say? Based on what we're reading here, it's fair to say that when a licensee comes before the board, they are usually clean up their act after the first or second violation. We have not got to the point where we've had to suspend or revoke a license. The major problem that we see is with people having entertainment violations. And entertainment is obviously people that have things like DJ's, Karaoke's and bands and things of that nature. After 09:00 those are usually the major violations that we see. But typically what the board decides to do is they'll just revoke or suspend not the liquor license, but the entertainment permit. And usually if a location has entertainment and that entertainment permit is restricted or revoked, you know, like I said, they clean up their act very, very shortly thereafter. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Mister Dunoga, did you have any questions? No, thank you. All right. Thank you very much. I just had a question regarding community outreach. You mentioned that your office does that, so I just wanted to find out in what how do you do that and where do you go and what does that entail. So we host at least two to three. I'm sorry. We participate in the Seamast meetings, which is at the University of Maryland. Their police department holds a county multi agency services team where they bring community members in from College park and they talk about alcohol related issues as well as other issues. So that's one of the things that we do. We do that at least four to five times a year, if not more. And also we attend numerous community meetings where we're requested to attend things of that nature, where we request that we generally show up. That's pretty much it. All right, I think you have another question. I'm sorry. Okay, Kathy, your question made me have a follow up question because I did see that point in the budget book where it talked about community meetings attended. So is it fair to say because you talked about the one in college park that's maybe like four times, but it only has eight listed in total. In total. Is that just because a lot of communities aren't requesting you guys to attend to meetings? It just depends on what's going on in the community. If someone's having a lot of problems with noise complaints in a particular community as it relates to establishments, then if we're requested to come. We will, but we also do community work groups. One of the community work groups that we recently did within the last two years or so was alcohol density work group, where people were trying to figure out how to disperse the amount of liquor stores that are in the inner beltway. And that was a community work group that we were a part of as well. And who led that work group? I'd have to. My gray matter, I'm a little bit older than I thought. Offline the final report. I'd be interested in that. Absolutely. Yeah, I would like to see that as well. And one more question, because we're kind of sparking those questions. So do you all also provide entertainment permits as well as the liquor license? Yes. So there's only a couple of different types of establishments that are allowed to have entertainment. So I'll just real quickly kind of go through it. A license are generally liquor stores. That's what you think of when you see a liquor store. That's an a license. A b license is our restaurants. That is the majority of our licensees. There's about 340 of them. There's about 145 liquor stores. And then we have something called a b, which is a restaurant that might have a packaged goods store or a liquor store attached to it. Okay, so that's a b. So then we have our cs, which are fraternal orders, our VHW v veterans halls, and things of that nature. And then we have our ds. So our ds are everything else.

So the only one of our licensees that are allowed to have entertainment are our bees, our restaurants, and we have about, at last count, there's probably about 130 of those that have entertainment permits. So those permits could be revoked without having the liquor license revoked, correct? That's correct. Okay, just checking. All right. Are there any other questions? Thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate you. Absolutely. Thank you so much. All right, we will now bring forward the office of Central Services director, Jonathan Butler. Welcome, everyone. All right. Sorry I don't have my spotlight today to shine on you, but it's okay. That's right. Thank you so much. All right, Andrew, are you ready? Yes, I am. All right. All right. We will begin with our analyst today, mister Stover. Thank you, madam chair. Once again, my name is Andrew Stover, analyst for the Office of Budget and Policy Analysis. Here to present to you the FY 2025 budget for the Office of Central Services, as well as the Office of Procurement. So, just to start out, I want to talk about the fact that with executive order number 220 24, the agencies of Central Services and procurement will be separated beginning in FY 2025. And so when the budgets were submitted, they were submitted separately as a budget for the Office of Central Services and then a budget for the Office of Procurement. So if you look at the budgets, it's going to be split. I think it's good to have a context around this change. And so on the second page of the report, you can see the combined budget for the Office of Procurement and Office of Central Services to show what the change would have been if they had stayed as one entity. And there you can see that the Office of Procurement and the Office of Central Services have a combined budget of 47.5 million, which is a decrease of around 1 million, or 2% from the Office of Central Services FY 2024 approved budget. Moving on to specifically the Office of Central Services, you can see that the budget proposal they have is 25 million, which is a 21.5% decrease from the FY 2024 approved budget. This increase, sorry, this decrease being mainly due to the separation of the Office of Procurement. They have 36 employees that they're sending to the Office of Procurement, as well as operating costs as well. Compensation is proposed at $9.7 million, which is about a decrease of $3.5 million. Once again, as a result of the 36 employees being moved as of March 2024, the office has reported 34 vacancies. 16 of those vacancies are for funded positions. If you want to see a closer look at what those positions are and what the status of those positions were as of March 2024, you can take a look at attachment a of the first round budget responses. And I'll just add that one challenge that OCS has pointed out to us is just continued challenge of attrition and vacancies that have strained staff capacity. And the budget for over time has also notably increased to reflect historical costs, which you can see on page four that the overtime budget increases from 300,000 to 400,000. Historical costs have showed that it has been around 400,000. It's projected to be maybe 330,000 for FY 2024. And that's why that proposed budget is increasing 100,000 more dollars to reflect those historical costs. And the need for overtime is driven by the need for emergency requests and various repairs that must be made before and after regular hours. So it is a necessary cost in the budget when it comes to operating expenses. They are proposed for ocs at $13.3 million, which is a decrease of 15.4% or $2.4 million. The major line items that you can see are operating contracts and building repair maintenance. Both of those are over $1 million. In the case of operating contracts, it's $9 million. For a look at what operating contracts that they have, you can take a look at attachment b to the first round responses. On page six you can see a look at the information technology projects that they have going on. There are a number of projects that they continue to work on to make their systems more efficient and make staffing a bit easier or make things a bit easier for the staff in terms of workload. Finally, when it comes to workload and program key points, I just want to point out that the county space and facilities continue to grow. The office has looked towards prioritizing the most critical projects with its ten year facilities master plan and you can find that in attachment g to the first round responses to see what their high or critical needs are and that kind of guides how they're budgeting for the next ten years. Also, just that wanted to add that the county, as I said, spacey grown. They have real property value of they estimate around $705 million.

A listing of all the facilities owned by the county can be found in attachment e to the first round response. Moving on to the office of Procurement. Their budget is approximately 6.8 million. We don't have the exact historical cost because before they were in the office of Central Services, but most of the costs associated with this budget are costs previously incurred by the Office of Central Services for Procurement related activities that are being transferred to the Office of Procurement. The expenses that are new include three new positions. So 36 positions transferred and there will be three new positions. These positions being a chief procurement officer or director, an associate director of administration and a human resources analyst. Some other increases you can see in the operating expenses are increases that are temporary for the cost of setting up operating procedures for the office and temporary staffing. That is going to cost, I believe around $344,000 is what they estimated for us in terms of information technology projects. They are still working on improving speed, which is their acquisition platform, their procurement software platform, specifically with the life supplier lifecycle platform that will help them stream supplier performance evaluation and supplier registration. And office is looking to implement this module in 2024, FY 2024 and FY 2025. As far as workload and key performance indicators here you can see a lot of the data on page eleven and page twelve of the report has some really important data as far as contracts that have been awarded the status of the businesses that are being awarded these contracts. In terms of minority business enterprises, county based businesses and small businesses generally, the office has continued to meet the requirements and in many cases exceed the requirements for distribution of projects for these groups. I want to move on next to the internal service fund, for which is the fleet management fund, and there is no change in the proposed budget, but it does include funding for a new position and some increased overtime, while also cost per vehicle repair and maintenance continue to rise. So you can see, if you turn to page 14, a breakdown of their operating expenses, which is around $5.7 million, a 1.1% increase from 2024. The two biggest line item expenses that they have are vehicle equipment repair and maintenance for $4.1 million and other operating equipment repair maintenance for $496,000. And a part of this reason is these costs keep going up is because maintenance has become a really important part of what fleet management is doing as it has been particularly difficult for them to secure new vehicles even after they have passed. What is the current recommendations for replacement standards? And if you look in the program points here, you can actually see that 40%. It's estimated that 40% of the fleet currently exceeds the vehicle standards, the replacement standards, and this is due to costs. With inflation, costs are going up. But there are other significant challenges that the office continues to face that has made it extremely hard to secure new vehicles in a timely manner. So one example is that as of April 2024, the office has experienced wait times of more than six months for approximately 117 vehicles, some of these vehicles being ordered way back in September. So we see that there is a big delay that is happening and that is affecting the department and is also contributing to increased maintenance costs as a result. One other impact that it is having is on the Green Fleet initiative. You can see some highlights of the Green Fleet initiative on page 17 of the report. But in terms of the impacts that these challenges are having when it comes to police interceptor utility hybrids and rolling those out, there have been a shortage of battery materials which has led to no clear timelines for the delivery from auto manufacturers on when the police are going to be able to secure these videos. And then also so with just the miscellaneous ev's and hybrids that the office has. Again, the three battery shortages have made it hard to secure vehicles with some orders being canceled or delayed indefinitely. And in the meantime, the office has had to turn to going back to vehicles that primarily rely on gas and oil. Finally, the last part of the budget is the special Revenue fund for the Collington center that is budgeted at $5,000 for FY 2025, and a list of the Collington center parcels that are remaining to be sold can be found in attachment m of the first round responses. The last part of the budget is the capital improvement program portion. I won't go through every single project, but I do want to highlight some of the projects that have seen changes. But to give you an overview, the entire total of all the projects existing right now, which are 22 different projects. That's a decrease of two projects from last year and the total is $751 million. When it comes to FY 2025, the funding is approximately $45 million.

When it comes to FY 2025, the funding is approximately $45 million. On page 19 we start, you can see a table of all of the projects and some of the changes that they have had from last year's budget going through some of the projects. The central control administrative wing expansion has increased by 3 million from the last year. The community corrections complex in the latest CIP, the date was pushed back from 2026 to 2030 and the total cost of this project has also risen by 1.2 million. When it comes to the county administration building refresh. This project completion date has been moved to FY 2030 and the total cost for the project has increased by 16.5 million for a new total of 46.4 million with the district five police station. While the project completion date was identified previously as 2026, this new proposed budget now specifies that the completion date is TBD with the district six completion police station. The project had previously been estimated to be determined, but is now looking to be completed in FY 2028 and the cost for that has increased by $4 million. On page 2022, the National Harbor Public Safety Building has a project completion date of the of FY 2024 last year, but that completion date has also now been listed as to be determined and the total cost of that project has increased by around 500. When it comes to Prince George's homeless shelter, that project has been pushed back from FY 2026 to FY 2028. The project has increased by $7.5 million with Shepherd's Cove family shelter. That project completion date has previously been FY 2026 and now is a completion date of FY 2028. With the Special Operations division facility, the cost of the project has increased by 900,000 for a total of 27 million, and finally, with the warm homeless night shelter, the project completion date was previously slated to be FY 2024, but has now been listed as to be determined. And the total cost of this project has increased by 8.7 million. So that covers my review of the Office of Central Services and the Office of Procurement. Thank you. Thank you. Mister Stover, Mister early, did you have anything to add? Yes, thank you, Madam chair. I just want to point out one item related to the capital budget, and I'm not sure we quite talked about that. We are in a process, this is like a second year of a process of consolidating the management of public safety capital projects and into ocs. Previously OCs had some of them, some of them were in the various public safety agencies. There still will be some sort of ongoing things, but major new facilities will be entirely managed through ocs with of course, input by those agencies, basically allowing for people who are, whose focus is facilities to be in charge of development of those facilities. Thank you. All right, we'll now turn to Director Butler, and if you would please introduce your team and everyone here with you today. Absolutely. Good morning, madam chair, Mister vice chair, members of the committee. I'm Jonathan R. Butler, director for the Office of Central Services. So I start to my far right there I have Nicola Martin, who's our budget manager, Pamela Dickerson, who's our deputy director over procurement, supplier development and compliance. JP Bombardier, deputy director of business services, and then our associate director, Barath Cordegarri, over CIP. So just a few thoughts about the organization. I think we have a presentation, just a quick overview. If someone could put it up. I know it was up earlier. My other deputy director, I was just reminded he's out on bereavement leave. Michael Brown, deputy director over technical services. All right, let's see, can we maybe to the next slide or here's the pointer. Oh, down. Okay, gotcha. Great. All right, so a little bit about just the office of Central Services. Here's our chart. Rather busy structure, but it's a busy agency. So I think from this, the takeaway from this, if you look up in the far right hand corner, is that we have total staff on board of 215 total vacancies funded, 13 vacancies funded. And then our current vacancy rate is at 6%. So I think that's a pretty divine number, given the size of the agency, the fact that we're now at a 6% vacancy rate. But this is the layout, sort of the top level of our organization with our deputies as well as our division managers and some of our other particular managers. So a little bit about what we do. We do a lot. And I think you kind of heard that a bit in our budget, just a lot that's going on. So, you know, when you look at fleet management, we acquire, maintain and repair about. We have about 3000 vehicles, over 3000 vehicles in our fleet management operations, supplier development, diversity. We got nearly 1000 certified businesses now in our database. And that has been growing at least 10% year over year. Real estate lease management. We're the custodians, landlords for hundreds of acres here in Prince George's County.

So I think that's a pretty divine number, given the size of the agency, the fact that we're now at a 6% vacancy rate. But this is the layout, sort of the top level of our organization with our deputies as well as our division managers and some of our other particular managers. So a little bit about what we do. We do a lot. And I think you kind of heard that a bit in our budget, just a lot that's going on. So, you know, when you look at fleet management, we acquire, maintain and repair about. We have about 3000 vehicles, over 3000 vehicles in our fleet management operations, supplier development, diversity. We got nearly 1000 certified businesses now in our database. And that has been growing at least 10% year over year. Real estate lease management. We're the custodians, landlords for hundreds of acres here in Prince George's County. I think it kind of pans out to well over 2000 plus parcels. And we run sort of a portfolio of well over 500,000 leased space design and capital construction. I think we heard some of the numbers that within our portfolio for design and capital construction, we have about a quarter billion dollars of CIP projects under management, contracting and procurement. On average, we buy, procure nearly a half a billion dollars in goods and services. And then we have warehousing and archival management, which is a great facility. We have in land, over 100,000 square foot warehouse where when you walk in there, so much materials that are there, supplies valued at well over $13 million in terms of the value of that particular inventory. We're responsible for facility operations and management for county buildings, which is well over 5 million space. And then mail and delivery services, reproduction services. So we process up nearly about a million pieces of mail annually through the office of Central Services, through our general services division. And then on top of that, we have compliance where we are responsible for wage monitoring, wage determination, and making sure that supplier utilization plans are in compliance. So a lot in what we do that's under one roof. A few accomplishments, just a quick overview in the top left, I'm just going to go from left to right. So we delivered the new Bladensburg library here recently. We also delivered a new police k nine and Evoc facility. And these are actual pictures. That was a ribbon cutting day. We have the new police special operations division hq now under construction. If you go down Dilly drive, you kind of see that that has come out of the ground. Also, the police forensics lab is also under construction. Just recently we acquired a new building for the replacement of the Chevrolet Clinic, which is now under design. When we talk about fleet, two major awards here recently, our hundred best fleet. We were ranked number three in the country in our fleet operations, as well as number 16 for the top best for the top public green fleet. So, doing some good things there within our fleet operation. Recently, our outreach efforts, we put on a great event where we talked about and highlighted a profile, well over $200 million in construction opportunities for our small and minority businesses. Another really successful outreach event was here recently with our procurement summit. With a good number of businesses attending there, we're in the midst of also upgrading and modernizing our building spaces. So if you were to walk into a number of the buildings here in Largo, you'll see a good refresh that has been completed in some and ongoing in others. We've delivered the newly renovated Surratt's Clinton library. One of the pieces that you heard about was the facility master plan. We've developed and activated the county government's first ten year facility master plan, which is really the road map for the next ten years of how we intend to make capital investments in our facilities. And then finally, but certainly not last, there are a number of other things we have construction and build out for the new HHS building. This is where we plan to actually relocate several agencies there, and that's going to be a vibrant location here in the coming months. So just a few recent accomplishments for the office of Central Services. Thank you. And sort of end it with some, I think, some really good numbers here. Start off with the chart to the far left. So if you kind of take a look at it, you see just a trend over the last probably seven years, so to speak. Well, 20 17, 20 18, 20 19 pretty much was before this administration. So if you take a look at the sort of the demarcation there with the red line, that kind of shows where the beginning of the first full year of the Omasel Brooks administration and looking at the four year trend there where we've actually met or exceeded our goals. So the blue bars represent county small businesses. The goal for county small businesses was 30%. The Orange bars represent County MBE. The goal by law is 20%. So you can see starting in FY 20, we started to see the numbers grow with our intention and how deliberately have been in developing, growing and investing in our smaller minority businesses. By 2021, we exceeded both goals. By 2022, we continue to exceed those goals and certainly in our latest numbers, FY 2023, we've exceeded those goals by somewhere near 40% to 50%. So continuing in a positive trend in supporting and growing our small and minority businesses. And then some quick numbers to the far right, our new supply schedule, which has been in operation in that first full year, we had a handful of vendors. We did about $6 million in spin. We've doubled that number of vendors. And FY 24. I think you're going to see some really good numbers at the end of FY 24. As we continue to grow that program, our mentor protege program. Very excited about that. 21 approved mentor firms that are participating in that program as well as 28 approved protege firms.

So just a little bit about the office of Central Services and happy to answer any questions. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right, mister vice chair, you have questions? Yes, thank you, madam chair. Thank you, Director Butler, for joining us this morning. And to your leadership team, for all that you do, being ranked, leading the nation and vehicle maintenance and fleet maintenance, what you all are doing is really great. Thank you. Just wanted to say that. My question is, it's about staffing. And I'm looking at your staffing levels when it comes to maintenance of facilities. You talked about 5 million square foot of county owned building square footage. And so when I look at this, I'm looking at five plumbers, one master plumber, one master electrician, one drywall mechanic, one three electrician. My question is, that's a lot of square footage for just this minimal amount of operational staffing to do this work. And so my concern it really is, and maybe you can help me understand how much we're paying in outsourcing towards contracts for individuals to come in and do this work, which, there's got to be a balance. We can't outsource everything and then still not have the appropriate operational staffing. If that happens, then what? We're outsourcing, they control the marketplace of how much we're going to pay. Right. And so we're giving all our gold away and we're paying probably triple and double. When, if we had the operational staffing that individuals that could actually do this work in house, we would cut costs. And so that would, that's just basically my question. 5 million square foot of square footage of county owned buildings is a lot for one drywall mechanic. So help me understand that. No, I think that's a very good question. And I think as with other jurisdictions who struggle to try to find the right balance of in house staff versus contractual services, I think this is why you see we have a sizable contractual services budget to provide supplemental labor for that. But that's, you know, that's standard. When you look at some of those traits, those are difficult traits to probably hire for. Often you have a lot of folks who don't go into those traits anymore. And so you have to rely on some degree of outsourcing to find the right balance. There so I think you'll see that across many governments that have a core staff or facility folks, but supplemental staff coming from the outside. I could appreciate that comment, but we have to be forward thinking as well. That's a challenge that we know we have. Right. You, you can compare it to other jurisdictions, but we don't have other jurisdictions money like other jurisdictions have. Right. And it's, we're not going to solve it here today. That's not my point. My point is part of your ten year plan, when you talk about infrastructure is how we address that staffing level as well. And I don't know if that's involved with it because I haven't necessarily taking a deeper dive into that, but I think it's something that we need to look at when we're dealing with that. Furthermore, my last question. Oh, it is about this. We see through p three. You know, we've done p three in the school systems for school backlog of school infrastructure where we probably had about $10 billion worth of backlog of school infrastructure. When you just gave us that seven, that whopping $751 million worth of CIP projects that are getting pushed back. How do we address that? The one concern, and I'll just speak in general to my district and I understand the money's not there. Right. Like I'm realistic about that. But when you have a district five police station, and maybe it's how we, we address police station, police stations, infrastructure. What's concerning is I have 38% of the landmass of the county. District five doesn't have two sectors. It has one sector which covers about 90% in my district. So you can go all the way from Eagle harbor to Upper Marlboro, which is about 40 minutes drive. We have police response times. We have a district that might be out of boundary when it comes to where it's centrally located. So my first year on the council, about six years ago, I put this in to make sure that we can get some planning and design done, and then now it's getting pushed back. And I understand why I'm not here to harp on that, but there has to be a plan to address this, because if our community is growing, we can't control population. And we need to make sure that the communication between the Prince George's county police department and the office of Central services, how we address, maybe Stan can, Mister early can address this is how we address this infrastructure need when it comes to $751 million, when we have a very tight budget, we're in budget constraints cost containment measures now. But TBD doesn't say anything. It could be 25 years from now.

So you can go all the way from Eagle harbor to Upper Marlboro, which is about 40 minutes drive. We have police response times. We have a district that might be out of boundary when it comes to where it's centrally located. So my first year on the council, about six years ago, I put this in to make sure that we can get some planning and design done, and then now it's getting pushed back.

But TBD doesn't say anything. It could be 25 years from now. So how do we deal with that? Yeah, let me, let me just take a stab at that. So one of the ways that we're addressing the infrastructure needs is through the facility master plan, because that actually prioritizes the first 2 million space, about 20 facilities when you look at it, and what the capital investment needs are going to be over the next ten years. And so we've already started with investment in a number of facilities at the moment with mechanical, electrical, plumbing upgrades. And so that is our roadmap and that is how we are prioritizing the $750 million in terms of what facilities are in the greatest need of repair and modernization. So that's, that started structural piece there that answers to the structure. It doesn't, it doesn't answer to my boundary issue. You're talking about plumbing and electrical. I'm talking about boundary issues. That problem started many years ago. I told you I've been on the council for six years, and then you're talking about a ten year master plan. You put another four years on top of that. Where we are, from a budget perspective, it does not answer the question. The question is, are we looking at other ways to address that? Because we're almost at ten years now. Well, you're talking funding needs, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. So I'll yield to colleagues in OMB and I wouldn't talk about plumbing intellectuals and building. Yeah. And I was giving you sort of a perspective of how we intend to attack it from a priority prioritization view. Councilmember, I guess two things. One, I would to follow on Mister Butler's comments, I do think what they're doing in regard to the master plan and this whole section here of all of the looking at, relooking at everything will make some shifts and I think will give us a better allocation of resources. Now having said that, we have about, as you mentioned, it's about $750 million worth of projects. I would probably say that ideally that number would be bigger. We have to make choices as to how to address that. And yes, there are things like boundary issues and legal requirements and so forth, and all those things have to be adjusted and have to be addressed. That's one of the reasons for consolidating that whole planning process in OCs as opposed to having it in the different departments, because the different departments have a lot of expertise, but not necessarily in where we should focus the buildings. Now, the total amount of how you fund it, whether you do p three s. Whether you buy buildings, whether you lease buildings, whether you is really just an optimization exercise. And I don't think any of those things are going to radically change the dollar numbers that will be needed to address that. I agree with you that we need to have further looks at how we, at how many resources we commit. But I do believe that what OCs and public safety have been doing to look at the resources have been, are really a critical step in identifying how much more additional money we put we need and where we would put it. So, Mister Oleg, I appreciate the comment in explaining that. I just think that as, you know, you all doing the best you can with what you got, right? We're in a tight budget. If anyone understands the budget, I understand the budget. But there's other things than dollar and cents that go with it, from legal requirements to boundary issues, things of that nature. And while you're centralizing how that is implemented, the communication between those various agencies, as you know, plays a very critical role in that process. So I just wanted to be determined. You know, we could easily put that for a while. And maybe we need to look at, from my perspective, from the legality of how we deal with police response times and the timing of that as well. When that was instituted was back in 2002. And is that an accurate time that is assessed per our population? So, you know, there's just something that we have to look at. I know, but you're the office of Central Services and I just think that there's some more things that we can do, but we're not going to solve 751 million right now at this table. But you answered my question. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much, council member. Thank you. And thank you for your presentation. Just a few questions. One thing I've just been thinking about, especially how we invest. Well, we have to make tough decisions, right? So we talked about how some of our shelter programs, for example, are being pushed a little bit further back into completion. And we're also juggling like the investment we have in county buildings and facilities. And so just trying to understand, like how do we prioritize what we're going to prioritize first, right?

But you answered my question. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much, council member. Thank you. And thank you for your presentation. Just a few questions. One thing I've just been thinking about, especially how we invest. Well, we have to make tough decisions, right? So we talked about how some of our shelter programs, for example, are being pushed a little bit further back into completion. And we're also juggling like the investment we have in county buildings and facilities. And so just trying to understand, like how do we prioritize what we're going to prioritize first, right? Are these county buildings going to end up saving us money? And I asked that question because how are we doing like audits on? Does it make more sense to even be working remotely for some of these agencies? We can shift to smaller footprint and buildings because that's just something I think from a community perspective, right. If we're constantly seeing like new shiny buildings, for us to work in. But then our unhoused population, we're not increasing beds. We're seeing, you know, I don't know if you guys have been to the men's shelter, it's in horrible conditions. So it's hard to justify that. So just trying to understand that justification. Yeah, sure. So when it comes to our county facilities and again brings us back to the facility master plan and that whole ten year planning piece and what we're doing there is really working to extend the useful life of our facilities. You know, we still, I believe, and a number of our facilities have another good 2025 years once we make such capital renewal over the next several years. So, and it makes sense because there is very little inventory out there to purchase and to rebuild. And you also have to look at the acquisition of land as well. So there's a lot of additional cost that goes into looking at new facilities and things of that nature. So to make the investments in our existing facility in order to get additional years out of it, makes sense. You talked a little bit about soda Covid, and so we kind of have been working through with a number of agencies on developing sort of a post Covid workplace. So we, a number of agencies. We've completed some early designs and configuration planning. Certainly it will take some dollars to build out, but we're on that path in looking at our facilities post Covid and looking at our workspaces and making sure that we rethink and reimagine those spaces for optimal engagement and optimal delivery of services. Just glad that you guys are thinking about that, because I know in a lot of spaces, they move to, like, the hot desk model, and it makes us more competitive. We have so many people also leaving. We hear some agencies because they don't have the remote work schedule. Right. And so just, I know that that also can help us when it comes to, like, building facilities as we move forward. Yeah. As we redesign some of our spaces. Yeah, we will certainly have hoteling spaces, smaller office spaces, reducing the square footage. And, you know, that will help facilitate a better sort of hybrid approach to working. So appreciate the question. Thank you. No, thank you. Another question. When we look at the breakdown for the MBEs, is there any way we could get that drilled down a little bit more, like with women, black Latinx community? Because I see the full percentage. But do you guys have that data that we can get? We can see, I think, you know, when we look at sort of how they certify, we do ask for some of that information, you know, especially I think we do ask for race. I think that's where you're kind of getting at. Right? And actually, I think we can. Yeah, we can. We can kind of do that further, drill down. Perfect some of that follow up. And when we count them in the category, because we have the, the amount we're spending with MBE's, but then also with the county based small businesses, is it a possibility for someone to be counted twice? It is, but we try to, we try. We try to separate that so we aren't double counting. So what you may see are truly MBE's and truly county based smalls. So, yeah. Okay, perfect. That's always have been a challenge because we have dual and triple certifications, but we make sure that we aren't, you know, double counting the same firm twice. Perfect, so to speak. And is there a level because we see the county based small businesses and then we have just the county based MBE's. Is there another threshold that specifically looks at the county based small MBE's, or is that not a threshold that we can see? Because I've heard issues, like, even with our MBE, some of them are the larger ones. And then what we're seeing is there's this, like, weird space where they're both a small business and an MB, but they're not getting, like, penetrating the government, like, procurement market as. Yeah, I think when you start, also start looking at some of our procurement data, a lot of our county based small are also MBEs, which means they're also county based MBEs as well. So. And that's why we kind of, when we track the MBE piece, you're going to have some MBE's that may be outside of the county, but some that may be in. But still, it's a minority business enterprise, which is in compliance with our goal. Our county based small, even though we look at it strictly as a county based small. But then when you look at many of them, they have a dual certification MBE, which makes them also an MBE located within the county. So again, I think there's some good numbers there, and we continue to see that trend grow in our investment in those businesses. May I add? Yeah, absolutely. Pamela. Hi. We actually corrected the application, and we have added county based MBE's as a category so there's no duplication.

We actually corrected the application, and we have added county based MBE's as a category so there's no duplication. And you can immediately see who are the county based smalls and county based small MBE's. Okay, so fix that. Oh, awesome. Yeah, I think before manually, we'd have to go back and look and see if they were actually located in the county. So that's great. Fantastic. Okay. Awesome. I just have two more questions. Yes. Okay. Going back to. I know we pushed out the date you mentioned for the shelter in your report. I'm assuming that the men shelter one. And then you talked about Shepherd's Cove, but then we also talked about the warm nights and so. Right. All of them, Sally. But with the warm nights, I know originally we had dedicated ARPA funds for that, and I know that has, like, a end date of spending. So did we just reallocate all the funds that were dedicated to warm nights last year, Stanley? Well, yes. So the warm nights is no longer using ARPA funds. And so now the Arpa funds have. I think it's still being decided where those ARPA funds will be spent. The ARBA funds are shifted to another one of the shelter facilities it may have gone to for 2025, though, because the two dates were pushed out. Are the end days just pushed out, but funds are still allocated for them, this in 2025. So, to be clear about some of the shelter projects, the funding is there. So the allocation may have just been pushed out a year, so to speak. So when you look at the men's shelter, that project is underway. So, as you know, going through sort of the early community engagement, pre design services, conceptual design, as we go through the full design, then we look to have a shovel in the ground soon for that particular project. The same with Shepherd's Cove. We actually have procured AE to start the pre design work, feasibility, site analysis. So that project is underway from a design perspective. Then we have the youth center, which I think in the book is sort of promised place. This is where we're actually acquiring a facility to then engage in a design bill to deliver a youth center, a youth shelter, so to speak. So that is underway as well. I'm really excited about those projects. I'm looking forward to their completion. And I'll just note again, I think that if we could get the updated ARPA list for 2025, it's not in the budget book, and I'm sure that's just a technical oversight. So. Yes, Miss Skinner. Thank you, madam chair. You are going to get an updated ARPA list in about five minutes. We wanted to make sure you're getting the most accurate information. Thank you. I appreciate that. Madam chair, you have a question? Thank you, councilor. I recognize that I'm only a low level person here in Prince George's county, but I was curious about. You have 116 vehicles waiting for maintenance, and that seems like a lot. What kinds of maintenance are they waiting for how long might it take? Not necessarily for maintenance. I think that's 116. That's on back order. We're waiting for backward, we're waiting for delivery. Yeah. And what is the holdup there? Just. Yeah, so it's an array of holdups, mostly on the manufacturer side, with manufacturer delays, delays in equipment, just slow deliveries. There have been some cancellations, so we're dealing with it like many other public fleet operations, and some of them are starting to trickle in. Are any of them electric? Yes, some of those are battery electric because there has been sort of a lithium battery shortage in the industry. So we're seeing that as well. But we're seeing sort of that grip loosening on some of those electric vehicles. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Mister Dunoga, did you have any questions? Yes, just real quick. Thank you. How old is the ten year facilities master plan? 2022, December of 2022. So 2023 was sort of the first full year starting in 2023 for that facility master plan. Okay, so I had one on your website. Couldn't find a facilities master plan, but our staff had sent us one last December. But this is just for 20 buildings, it's not for all the county properties. We were talking police stations and other facilities. I thought that this, the ten year facility plan, from listening to the discussion, covered a lot of stuff based on the conversation, but it looks like it's limited more to the office space, or not just office space, but things along the lines of that. So it's the first phase of the facility master planning process. So the first phase, which. And you know, it's not a cheap process, it's a million dollars to actually do the first phase, which was about half of the square footage, we're actually. The next phase will cover the public safety facilities where we're going to look at the police stations. Fire bms have already started on the fire facilities, and then the following phase will be the remaining footprint or portfolio of the county building inventory. So it's a phase approach. Okay. That's why I was asking. The conversation led me to believe there was a giant document that had everything.

I know that in the past, many years ago, we did a public safety facilities master plan, I think in conjunction with park and planning. That's very old. That's probably 2009 or ten. So that's why we're embarking on a new public safety facility master plan. Yeah. And when do you has that literally started? Or is it just funded to be started, gotten pricing for it? And actually it will certainly kick off probably in the next 30 to 60 days, projected completion. Typically, that takes about six months. Okay. So, given Tory surrounding our public safety facility, especially when we're looking at police stations, it could. It's going to be about six months to go through that. That's fair. I just want to echo, I think, Miss Oriata comments regarding some of the homeless facilities. Seems like we have a lot to do there, and those need to be better prioritized. But I know there's a lot of priorities, but the inability to house people is becoming a big national issue, and I don't think we're where we need to be. All right. Thank you, madam chair. Thank you. Thank you. And it's. I just. I mean, I'll continue to echo that. I had a lot of questions regarding that, but I think. I think councilmember Oreava, you know, covered all the questions, especially to the unhoused homeless population. Very, very concerned about that, and would like to, you know, to understand how we could, you know, make some adjustments or something to at least do some upgrades to some of the facilities, because I get calls in my office all the time about it and the state of the facilities, as well as, you know, people on the brink of homelessness and looking for a place to go and people needing a place to go. So it's tough, and, you know, the beds are always occupied. So I feel like there's something. I don't know if we have to think outside the box. I don't know what that looks like, but, you know, that definitely needs to be a priority for us in some capacity. Mister early, did you have. Yes, I just wanted to correct something I said a minute ago. So the ARPA money was shifted to other places, and $8 million of bond money was moved into the homeless shelter projects. All right, thank you. Also wanted to find out, I know here it mentioned that you were expecting ambulances to come in in April. Have those been received yet? I will check as soon, as soon as I leave here, because I saw that as well, just to make sure those deliveries have come in, and we'll follow up on that. Okay. Because it would have been on backorder for quite some time, along with a couple of other emergency vehicles. Okay, great. Last question. In regards to the 13 funded vacancies, what barriers are you finding in regards to those vacancies? I know you mentioned about the trades, the people not getting into the trades anymore, but I wanted to find out if there were other barriers to funding those. No, I think some of the other barriers are common to some of the other jurisdictions, just the competition, the job market, where folks, we are seeing that when we look at our compensation structure sometimes may not be the highest, but it's certainly competitive. But I think it's still a competitive job market and we still have just some hard to fill positions just based on the scope of those positions. When you look at building engineers or building electricians, they have to be licensed and certified. And so there's a good deal of investment that a person has to make in him or herself in order to get to that level. But I think we're down considerably. Again, as I mentioned, with the 6% vacancy and getting down to 13, and not all 13 are building folks. Some of those, we're continuously hiring procurement folks and some other additional staff, administrative staff. Right. And I appreciate, you know, definitely down considerably. But I guess my concern is overtime also. So, you know, it would be great, you know, to have people in those positions. But I understand, and I didn't know if. Were you all part of a classification study that ohrm? I believe we were, yes. Okay. All right. All right. Are there any other questions?

Another thing I just wanted to point out with staffing is that they currently have five vacancies, and in the past year, there has been five employee separations, which is an attrition rate of about 7%. Reasons for separation have include retirement, transfer to other agencies, and also other job opportunities. One thing to know is that right now, a full 57 of current staff has ten or more years of service at the agency, which is great, but it has become a challenge for them to, you know, try and get young people that can continue that important work and make sure they're trained appropriately to be able to do that. Moving on, when it comes to operating expenses, the budget is proposed at $1.5 million, which is an increase of 3%, or about $44,000. By far, the biggest portion of their budget comes from office automation and then also operating contracts as well. All but three line items in this operating budget show increases over the previous year, but the biggest increase that we see here is only $43,000 increase in office automation to align with projected costs that are provided by OIT. When it comes to recoveries. You can see that information on page five. Recoveries total around $4.7 million, representing an increase of 288,000. And on page six, you can see a rundown of what projects they have working on in information technology. They have a project that they're in the process of implementing to migrate a new version of Kronos and a new treasury system. A more important project that has been in the works for a number of years now is the new treasury system that they want to implement. This is a project that is seen as extremely important to the office and how it functions. Right now, the county is operated on an outdated system, what they call a legacy system, which does pose a number of risks for the county. And when it comes to collecting sources like property tax, all of that information is contained in there. And so we want to make sure that this system is going to uphold. And so there is a project to bring in a new system, but the implementation of that has already seen multiple delays, and the go live date is once again being pushed back to spring 2024 from previously, it was spring. Sorry, spring 2025. Previously, it was spring 2024. The office sites that the main reason for this is having, you know, other mandates that they have had to comply with, such as the elderly property tax credit, any other tax credits. They do need what they call a quiet system in the run up and make sure that they have adequate staff resources to roll this program out. But despite the urgent need for the system, the office does maintain that further requirements put upon the office could delay that project even further back. And some additional risks that they have as well are that the main people that they have working on this project and implementation right now is currently two retired employees that are working on a part time basis to get this done. So if any of them was to separate from the agency, that could also cause some setbacks as well. When it comes to the fair election fund, the funding proposed there is $800,000.01. Thing I just want to point out is that funding is not expected to be provided at the level that the Fair Elections Fund commission believes that it will need. The commission has expressed that they think they need level of $3.6 million. And in the talks with the Office of Management Budget, there was the sense that we weren't told exactly how much it would be for the program, but there was a sense that this program will not get close to that number that is needed before the 2026 election starts that the commission thinks is needed for this program. The final thing I wanted to touch on, on page seven and eight is risk management. And you can see at the bottom of page seven the fund balance that exists for risk management. It is currently a funding debt of 225 million for FY 24, which represents a decrease of six, 0.3 million. And accident injury claims for FY 2024 are expected to slightly decrease. But the Office of Finance and OMB continue to work together to try and stop this deficit from getting any worse. But right now, there's no current plans to pay off any sort of lump sums to get that number down. Even more, you can see a breakdown of accident and injury claims from 2023 and 2024 on page eight.

Director early, did you have anything to add? Just clarification on the election fund. The. There is 400,000 additional dollars this year. There's $400,000 from last year. So the two have to be appropriate together and that's how you get the $800,000. But the issues that were raised in the presentation otherwise, I agree with you. All right, please. Yes. All right, Director McGibbons. McGibbon, would you please introduce your team and begin your presentation? All right, thank you. And thank you, Andrew, for that presentation. Good morning. Chair Watson, vice chair Harrison and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity of coming for you this morning. This morning I have with me my deputy, Linda Allen, my treasurer, chief of treasury, Cindy Busey and Rick Schnabel, who is our risk manager as well. And on the other side of the table I have my debt manager, Ron Halper, who is also here with us. And in the back of the room we have Tracy, who is our claims manager. Again, thank you for the opportunity. I'll give a brief overview. I think Andrew covered it well, about matters of our budget. We'll just run through our presentation and talk a little bit about who we are and some of the things we have accomplished over the past fiscal year and what we think we will accomplish by the conclusion of our fiscal year and then just look forward to some of the strategic initiatives for the upcoming year. So the I don't know if I control this or not. I don't think I do. Next slide, please. We have the three divisions here within the Office of Finance, the administration division, the treasury division and the accounting division. It's the down arrow. Okay. All right. And the administration division. Just some of the functions we do there. We do the debt management, the risk management, general administration and financial systems. Under the general administration, we have that new program added there, the fair elections fund commission support. In our accounting division, they're responsible for accounting and reporting. The accounts receivable function is there, as well as the accounts payable function, which gets a lot of traction with vendor payments and vendor related questions. Been pretty involved with the pandemic relief efforts and as far as payments to all the participants in that program. And of course in accounting, we also have payroll, the payroll function as well. In our treasury division we have our tax billing and collections group, our cash management group, which handles a $2 billion investment portfolio. We have our tax administration, who handles the billing and collection compliance efforts, our customer service group and our revenue collections group. Now just a brief discussion about some of the things that we have accomplished in 24 or will accomplish in 24. We had the successful launch of the Elderly property tax credit implement program in fiscal 24. That was quite an undertaking, very popular program with 25,000 applicants. And of the those applicants we had about 23,000 who were eligible and about 25% of them, some 6000 receiving credits in the amount of $2.2 million there. We are also underway with the implementation of the Public Safety Officer Real Property Tax Credit, which is effective this coming July, and it will provide up to $2,500 of county property tax credit. We're partnering with agencies for various communications around that and setting up an online portal where we can efficiently implement that particular program. Our Fair Elections Fund Commission launch was successfully accomplished by our office. We are meeting every second Wednesday of every month and the efforts there are on the way a very engaged commission, somewhat out of our bailiwick as far as what the Office of Finance does, but we have successfully launch that effort and as Stanley mentioned, there's some 800,000 that will be appropriated in fiscal 25, available in fiscal 25 for that effort. The next thing I wanted to discuss is our cyber captive self insurance strategy program. We have effectively and successfully set up a captive self insurance program for cyber security or cyber type claims. What was happening in the regular program was that we were paying quite a bit of premiums and retention money would have to go out the door if there was, if there were a claim and before we got the first dollar reimbursement from the insurers, we could have paid up to some $4 million before we were even able to get first dollar insurance. So what we did was set up a self insurance captive where that the county can contribute to that cell, captive cell and then retain the money and build equity in that to fund any potential claims. So that is a win for a risk management program. Additionally, we in the risk management area, we have our safety off", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Office of Finance", "insights": [{"observation": "Currently a funding debt of 225 million for FY 24, which represents a decrease of 6.3 million.

So that is a win for a risk management program. Additionally, we in the risk management area, we have our safety officer who is now certified as a occupational safety and health Administration standards instructor and so we can do some in house teaching our instruction on various safety efforts there. And we have an additional slide in the back of our presentation that just describes that in some more detail. On our debt management front, we've also successfully did the water quality subsidized loan for stormwater mitigation. A $65 million loan was done there over the 30 year term and the interest rates can't be beat. It's a 1.8% interest rate there and over a 20 year term. That saves accounting in just raw debt service payments, some $32.3 million with the NPV savings over the 30 year period with a ten year tail on the water quality loan NPV there of $10.6 million. Additionally, some other things that are being launched in 24 is the launch of a streamline unclaimed property communication outreach where we'll be communicating with those who we have paid, but yet they have not cashed their checks on claimed property. And then as a result of that, the money would have to then be over to the state. So what we're going to do is increase the communication to this group through postcards and also additionally we'll be attempting to do increased communication with our vendor community about direct deposit availability within the county to avoid any kind of delays in payment. And in our treasury group, we have language access compliance. We have effectively launched that. We've translated documents. We are getting good feedback from sister agencies on the effectiveness of our program there and just making sure that we have language access to our community for those who speak other languages other than English. I'm going to hand over to Linda to just talk about our strategic focus for fiscal 25. Thank you. Thanks, Steve. As Andrew and Steve both mentioned, we are really a very lean agency. We have ongoing responsibilities for, you know, providing key government activities. And then periodically, we're required to perform additional state and county mandated programs and initiatives. And it's why our FY 25 strategy really does focus on people and technology and innovation. And so we'll continue to enhance our team, implement the public safety officer tax credit, and we'll move into our second year of the senior tax credit, as well as ramp up for the 2026 election by staffing our fair election or the Fair Election Fund Commission. We'll continue to work with OIT to develop and deploy a new tax billing and collection system, and we'll work with our actuary, our claims administrator, and OMB to identify ways to decrease expenses and add more resources where we can to improve the health of our risk management fund. Our first strategy really does focus on our staffing and filling vacancies. We know we have to fill them with the right people, mainly because most of our staff, as Andrew even mentioned earlier, most of our staff has been with the agency over ten years. Most of our staff is over 55, so they can retire. And as you know, when long term employees retire, it's very difficult to replace them with someone who is experienced and who really can do the job effectively off the bat. So it really does make it somewhat difficult and challenging for us. And while we all know the value and benefit of working for county government, I don't know that we've really done a great job of letting millennials and Gen Z'ers realize the importance and the benefits of working for county government. So that's something that we want to definitely put more emphasis on, is really putting out there kind of the benefits of working for county government. But in the meantime, the employees that we do have, we know that we need to continue to develop them, that we need to encourage them to continue to participate in professional organizations and even get certifications. And we have done much more of that in the last few years, and we'll continue to do that in the coming years. So the next two slides I'm going to pass on to Cindy because she can talk about the elderly property tax credit and the tax system. Thank you and good morning again. Thank you and good morning again. So, for the elderly property tax credit, which went into effect in July, you've heard a little bit of this already. Going into the next year, that value for the assessed property cap is going up by the lesser of the 3% or CPI. So it goes to 515,000 for new applicants coming into the next fiscal year. In our implementation, we had, I think, 73% of those who applied were eligible, but were already receiving 20% from their homeowners or home homestead. So that put us at about the 25% or so that actually received a credit. And this is for those who have been in their home for at least ten years, for those who are over 65 and then also has the limit on their assessed value.

We worked with partners in creating flyers and distributing them. We had enrollment days where we also had a staff member who was a spanish speaker. So we had citizens able to come on site for three different blocks of time. And we were really. We were really just completely inundated by the response to this. Most of those applicants were paper. So also in handling and having to put things in, in a manual fashion, we are working right now on putting out a postcard that we will send out to anyone who was determined to be eligible, whether they received a credit or not, because they don't need to apply again, will have the ability to rerun those people in our system for each year going forward until they've actually received a credit, five years total. So, you know, as long as they are already eligible, they don't need to reapply. And we really are hoping that we can get that message out. So there's, you know, we have many, many calls that come through our customer service line of citizens feeling like they need to apply again because they didn't get the credit, but they were eligible. So we're also working on getting that onto our online system where they can go on and look up there where you can normally go on and look up your bill, and you'll be able to see there that you are eligible if you have already met the criteria. So that would be a huge benefit for us and not having to go through that. So we also will be participating again this year with the Department of Family services. They have an annual senior information fair. We'll be there with staff on site on May 14 14th, and we'll have staff there with computers that will be able to assist those who have not yet applied, that would be able to also apply at that time. And, yeah, so we're closely monitoring for any changes going forward as well on that credit and then on our tax billing system. Just a couple clarifications to make. The two staff members that we have that are working, that are retired and working part time, they are the key people managing our mainframe system, which is what we're currently using in order to create the bills and manage tax sale and all of those functions. They're critical in also the knowledge transfer. There are three to four developers at a given time working on the new system, and other several other IT staff members that are working on the development of this system. We have made significant progress on it. The elderly property tax credit is the most recent delay to our moving forward and being able to make the progress that we had anticipated originally. And so, just to be clear, the original delays were the fact that we're working on this during COVID So many of those it resources were redirected to developing systems for vaccinations and for the health department, and they've had turnover. So all of these things contribute to delays on our being able to move forward. The system that we're working on right now is a mainframe built in the eighties, as you heard. And we have many things that we're excited about on the new system that will streamline a lot of our manual processes, will be able to get away from spreadsheets that we're using for some of these processes, we'll be able to get away from a lot of the paper and being able to leverage a technology to have a more efficient system for the operations and also for the benefit of our citizens. So I'll go back to you. Our 25 proposed budget includes recoveries. Including recoveries is $5.8 million. And without recoveries, the total budget is 10.5 million, which is divided between our treasury division at 51%, followed by our accounting division at 34%, and then the smallest division, which is administration. As you can see, our agency is heavily relying upon its people. 85% of our budget is allocated to comp and fringe. And you can see just a small portion of our budget is actual operating. This graph actually highlights our operating expenditures, and as you can see here, most of that is spent on it related charges because we heavily rely upon oit to support our financial systems, our treasury system, and so that comprises about 900,000 of our operating expenses. The other 42% is comprised of contracts like banking services, printing and other softwares we use to do the financial. Our annual financial report, providing indirect cost rates. And we have forensic software and a few other softwares that help us do what we do. So I'll turn it back over to Steve. All right, thank you. Thank you, team members, for the presentation. And with that, I will just wrap up our presentation here just with a reminder of who we are and our ability to continue to deliver services for the county government and for our citizens with integrity, excellence, and our services. Those are our core values, and that's who we are. So with that, madam Chair, I'll open up for questions. Thank you, Director McGibbon. Are there any questions? Yes, vice chair Harrison. Thank you, madam Chair. I want to thank you, Mister McGibbons, and your leadership team for joining us and giving us this presentation.

Thank you, madam Chair. I want to thank you, Mister McGibbons, and your leadership team for joining us and giving us this presentation. Just to a couple quick questions you talk about. Part of your core mission is looking at the general obligation bonds and stuff of that nature. What are we. When you talk about general obligation bonds, how much do we owe in that? In totality? I have my debt manager here. We have a large debt portfolio. As far as our outstanding obligations, general obligation, as well as self supporting obligation. Ron, I don't know if you have those numbers before you, but I know it's in the billions. All right, thank you. Could you turn on your mic? Yes. Thank you. Microphone. Your microphone? Yes. Thank you. There are a number of different ways of looking at our general obligation debt. In the purest form, it is the general fund component of our larger general obligation debt portfolio. And at the beginning of fiscal year 24, we had $1.8 billion outstanding. Okay, and. And when is that's in totality, but each payment is due so differently. Yes. We have an amortization, a self liquidating amortization schedule for every bond issue that we do. Okay, so you gave me a totality number. If you're looking at the next. Roughly next two years, will we look at. Okay, so however, there is other components that have a general obligation pledge on them as a backup to certain revenues. So we have stormwater and solid waste components as well as well as school surcharge. So each of those has a dedicated revenue stream. But if that stream is fall short, there's an automatic backup general obligation pledge for them. Like stormwater and solid waste. And solid waste. School surcharge. School surcharge. Yeah. Yes, so. So those amounts. School surcharge, 356 million. Stormwater, 359 million. And solid waste, 76 million. And change. All right, so. And this is. That's totality though, right? That's what's outstanding. Outstanding of the fiscal year. Yes. Now, so the actual debt service for fiscal 24, for the general funds components only, after certain revenues were applied to it, was almost 170 million. That's on the general fund component only. Wow. What is the average interest rate on those bonds? Oh, that's a good news story. Until recently. Until recently. That's good news, bad news. Our lowest cost of funds on a geo bond issue was four years ago in 2020, and we had a 20 year cost of funds of about 1%. Well, you know, my mortgage rate was 2.5%, but that's changed. Now we're at 7%. So where are we at today? So our last bond issue had a. At a cost of funds of almost three and a half percent. It's going up. It's going up. And it's. And we're in preparation for the fiscal 24 bond issue, and it's. We're expecting a little bit higher cost offense there. Man, I got heartburn. Sorry. Yeah. All right, let's go to the next question. Oh, you mean you don't want to hear about cops and leases? Yeah, we could do that, too, if you want to feel like you want to share that with me. Well, this is chunk change compared to the others, but it. But it's real money. Yeah, it is. If I may just point out that we still have a 8% cap as far as what our debt service is, and we're still under that. So our debt program is being managed in a way to stay under that 8% cap. And I don't know if Stanley wants to speak to that. I got that. I got that. I'm just trying to get the severity of where we are fiscally. You know what I mean? You know, not talk around the issue, but talk right to it. That's significant. All right, so the question I have is the next when it comes to property tax. All right. You know, just the revenue coming in from transfer and recordation and property tax. We know we lost 90 million less in transfer and recordation in one year from 2023. 2022 to 2023. Correct. Significant. Well, there we go. And then I guess my question then would be about right of redemptions. I know that's through the court system, but those are individuals that haven't paid their property taxes in a significant amount of time. And then, I guess, what's the default rate when it comes to that? Do you all have that information of people that are not paying their property tax? Yeah, most of the people who go to tax sale end up redeeming their property. Okay. It's a few hundred that actually end up getting foreclosed on. Oh, that's all right. And then I just have a last statement, madam chair. If we're talking about 800, is four from what I gather from the report that you talked about, the fair election fund, it was 400 last year, 400,000 last year, 400,000 this year. And then that has to be appropriated at that point. Correct. 800 is appropriated in 25. So it is appropriated. And if you, in the budget presentation, you'll see that the 400, the full amount, is declared and appropriated for fiscal 25. 800,000. And I understand with budget that everything is balanced and it has to be inclusive. So I get that. To spend $800,000 of taxpayers money right now, with these type of looming budget realities that we have, I don't know if that's the best way to spend taxpayers money right now.

To spend $800,000 of taxpayers money right now, with these type of looming budget realities that we have, I don't know if that's the best way to spend taxpayers money right now. I think that we have other pressing needs. We have 800 people that have hiring frees in the county. Then we have cost of inflation when it comes to fringe benefits for our employees. So it's just more of a statement. I don't know if that's something that we want to do this year. I think that spends the wrong message to spend 800,000 for individuals that are seeking public office, taxpayers money when we have these type of debts that we have to pay. But I understand the balance of everything too. That's just a personal opinion. Thank you, Mister vice chair, councilmember Oriada. Thank you. Quick question, going back to the senior tax credit, and I apologize if you covered it. I'm not feeling so good today. So I'm not at 100%. But you talked about that there was over 25,000 individuals that applied that. About 23, I think you mentioned, that were eligible, around 5000 that got the credit. So just understanding what's the drop off between eligibility and receiving the credit that maybe I didn't speak to that. It's probably just the 20% allowance. Yeah, it's primarily the 20%. If they were eligible, they met the criteria, but they didn't get an actual dollar amount because they were already getting 20% from the others got it. So that's what you mean. Okay, so because I was taking that as not eligible, the 20%, but you weren't using that. So they would have gotten it if we had not had the cap at the 20%. Right. Okay. And so that was at the 2.2 million. So the projection of think was 10 million would be if everyone that has already applied, as you mentioned stay in the program, did not have to reapply. They'd be eligible without applying again. And that's where we get the $10 million estimate that we've heard before. Am I correct? Let me clarify. The $10 million, our initial estimate for this program was $10 million over the five year period. So roughly $2 million a year. And that's where we ended up $2.2 million for the first year. No, no. So $10 million for the five years. So, you know, we factored in as best we could, statistical data to come up with that number and knowing how many people are getting other credits. So that landed where we expect it to. Got it. So you anticipated on your end that the percentage of people that were not actually going to be able to get the credit from the homestead property tax because of the homestead or the homeowners. Some of them have their taxes fully covered by the homeowners, so they wouldn't have been there wouldn't have been anything for them to receive. Right. So what's the, are you asking breakdown between, like, what's then the percentage of people that are eligible that don't have the other tax you're talking about. But that was just capped on the homestead 20, the homestead and the homeowners. That's about 74% of the people. So the difference of people who applied that weren't eligible, those people, maybe it's not really their primary residence. Maybe they were already exempt for other reasons. Right. But you also just mentioned that there was a group of people that are already getting fully covered that applied. I'm just trying to understand what you just said. When people hear there's a credit, they apply. Right. So they might not even have a liability and they still applied. Right. So can you take off that number? So I can, y'all know it. Okay. So what I, what I can tell you is how many were eligible to receive the credit and then how many people actually got the credit because they weren't capped? Those people who are eligible don't need to apply again because every year they will be in our queue and we'll rerun them. So if they drop below or something changes, they would then get a credit. They don't need to apply. That's something I like. You don't have the numbers now, but offline to see. So that, because to your point, I guess if they're just applying, but it wouldn't, it's already covered. There wouldn't actually be a cost. So we could see the true numbers. But if you don't have it now. It's fine. Yeah. Thank you. We can get that. Thank you. Thank you very much, councilmember Dunoga. Thank you. I want to follow on that just for using the $500,000 limit. I think the simple math is you can get 20% and it's a. It's basically a dollar. So for the maximum amount for a year is $1,000, is that correct? That should be correct. Okay. So if I have a homestead property tax credit, that wipes that out and I only get a dollar, so I get a credit for $1, am I. And I get that same credit for the next four years, am I. Am I done? You've gotten a credit for five years? Yes. So you're actually penalized for getting a partial year. Just doing the math. I don't know what you mean by partial year. So the calculation and the way that it's written is that you'd receive a credit for five years. So that person would have received a credit and there wasn't a minimum amount put on the credit. Right. That's what. I'm just trying to play through the math.

People would qualify for the full thousand dollar credit under the scenario and they'd get $5,000 over five years. But in reality they might get $5 over five years. I can't speak to what was discussed outside of what we presented. What we presented was inclusive of the homeowners and homestead. So if that's already covered, it would never necessarily be that full amount. Thank you. Is Mister McGibbons saying something? No, I'm just saying that we implemented a program as it was passed so as to the policy piece of it that's outside of our purview. But we're just implementing the program has passed. I'm just pointing out maybe the council didn't know the mathematical implications. I think a lot of council members didn't understand. Understand the impact of the homestead property tax credit offset and the further offset. You know, you'd be worse off if you got a dollar a year than if you got zero and then later qualified. Anyway, I just want to touch on the fair election fund. I think Mister Harrison makes a very strong point about is this the best way to spend taxpayer dollars? But I'd consider supporting his position on that if we. But I think there's a way we could do. We could double that savings. I think we're spending. When you add everything altogether, probably a million and a half, 1.6 million on two at large seats. And since we have incumbents who are term limited and why wouldn't we consider putting on the ballot the elimination of the at large seats to save money? Just a thought. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Dunoga, thank you so much for your responses. Quick question from me regarding staffing, and I realize you all are spread thin and just wanted to find out if your agency was included in the classification study through OHRM. You want to speak to that? Linda? We were included in the classification study. We haven't received the results yet, but we were included. Yes. All right. Did you, was there a determination in when you would receive those results? No, not that I'm aware of. All right. Also wanted to find out, you know, other, I know it mentions here that, I know you all mentioned that it's a struggle trying to find people to fill the positions. So what's the plan for working to find those people? And has there been any success in what you've been trying to do to that end? I mean, we are somewhat limited in what we can do in that, you know, we'd love to be able to spend money advertising where we can advertise outside of the county website many times. That's where most of our positions are being, you know, advertised as there. So we do use other resources. We have Maryland government Finance officers association that we've, you know, put our advertisements there, you know, word of mouth. You know, we're just, there's just, we're limited in that way. We have put some new wording in some of our advertisements because we understood we had somebody help us kind of look at the wording to say, hey, this doesn't sound like a fun place to work, or it doesn't sound like, you know, somewhere I would want to work if I read this, it seems like it isn't very exciting. If the millennials reading this or if a Genex ears reading this, they're not going to come want to work for the county. So we have done some things to try to work with OHRm to change our wording on some of our applications so that, or on our advertisements so that, you know, it is a more attractive place. We certainly offer hybrid work. We really do emphasize that that's an important part of being able to work for the county, is that you can, you know, work in a hybrid environment, that you can work on a team, you know, responsible for, you know, really important things in the county. So those are just some of the things that we've been doing to try to get more people, attract more people to the agency. And if I may add, depending on the level of the position as well, there might be different strategies employed if we're hiring at a senior level type position. Sometimes there's concern about the how long they take to get vested, and we've lost candidates as a result of that. Just because nobody at a senior level coming in, they don't want to necessarily be committed to a ten year term before they can earn a pension. So it's the entirety of the package that we have to look at and then targeted to the type of employee that we're trying to hire. Do you find that some of the employees go to another jurisdiction for higher pay? That's always out there, the compensation package, whether it's the pay, the benefits and or the pension period piece of it, the more experienced people are looking at the total entirety of the package. You know, a junior person might only look at the pay and perhaps there's a bonus associated with it. But yeah, we can lose. We're in a competitive marketplace in the DC region, and so we deal with all that comes with that.

All right, now we will have the office of Human Resource Management acting director and DCAO McCarthy and his team. Thank you very much, Mr. McGiving. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good to see. I'm sorry, it's still morning. Whew. I'm doing great with time. Okay. Good morning. Good to see you all. Thank you and welcome. And we will first turn to our legislative budget and policy analyst, Mister Bonegas. Good morning. Chair Watson, vice chair Harrison and members of the committee. For the record, my name is Roger Benegas and I am with the budget and policy Analysis Division. I will be providing you with an overview of the fiscal year 2025 proposed budget for the Office of Human Resources Management. I believe the report is on page 76 of your virtual binder. And first off, I'd like to thank OHRM and OMB for their assistance throughout this process. I'll start off with the overview on page one. The fiscal year 25 proposed budget for the Office of Human Resources Management is approximately 12.4 million. This is an increase of 163,163 800,000, or 1.3%, over the fiscal year 24 approved budget. The increase is primarily due to the annualization of fiscal year 24, salary adjustments and additional seasoning, staffing to support public safety background investigations and the increase in OIT charges based on anticipated countywide costs for technology as well as operating increase adjustments for telephone printing and training. The offices expenditures are funded primarily by the general fund recoveries and 1 million in grant funding from the Department of Labor. Moving on to page two. Pages two to three for staffing changes in compensation fiscal year 25 general fund compensation is proposed at 8.2 million, which is an increase of 641,900 or 8.5% above the fiscal year 24 approved amount. The increase in compensation is primarily due to the annualization of prior salary adjustments and additional seasoning seasonal positions to support public safety background investigations. As stated above, the fiscal year 25 proposed budget includes authorization for 73 full time general fund positions, which remains the same compared to fiscal year 24 approved level and as of March 9, 2024, the office reported 13 vacant full time positions which to date the attrition rate in fiscal year 24 is 21% with eleven people resigning from the office, but it is actively recruiting for these positions. A summary of these employees is on page three of the report, and the tables on pages three to four provide a breakdown of the public safety Investigation division, their caseload, and the number of investigations conducted in calendar year 2023, as well as the average number of days it takes to process a public safety agency application. Moving on to fringe benefits on page page four of the report, fiscal year 25 fringe benefits are proposed at 2.5 million, which is a decrease of 65,700 or 2.5% under the fiscal year 24 approved level which is to reflect a reduction in the fringe benefit rate to align with projective cost and a five year trend analysis is on page four of the report. Oh sorry. A five year trend analysis of fringe benefit expenditures is on page four of the report. Moving on to operating expenses, fiscal year 25 operating expenses are proposed at 6.9 million. Overall operating expenses are decreasing by 650,300 or 8.6% under the fiscal year 24 approved budget level. The accompanying table on page five compares the fiscal year 25 proposed budget operating expenditures with fiscal year 24 approved budget operating expenditures. The most significant decrease is in the general and administrative contracts category, which is a decrease of 685,300 or 10.56% under fiscal year 24 due to an anticipated decrease and the most significant increase is in office automation which is a 19,900 increase dollar increase due to the OIT charges based on anticipated countywide costs, recoveries, which are on pages five to six are projected for fiscal year 2025 to total 6.3 million, which is an increase of 7755,100, or 13.4% above the fiscal year 24 budget level, primarily due to a change in the recoverable positions that include salary and fringe benefit adjustments and a breakdown is provided on page six of the report. Moving on to workload performance trends on pages six to eleven, the office strives to provide county agencies with qualified applicants to fill vacancies in a timely manner. A primary goal is to reduce the number of days required to fill a vacant position. You can see the table on page six for a breakdown and table. The table on page seven compares the number of separations by agency in fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024.

During the summer of 2024, the office's youth at Work slash Summer Youth Enrichment program plans to provide job placement opportunities for a total of 4500 youths, of which 1970 are expected to be county funded positions and the total proposed cost for the 2024 summer program is 2.8 million. The office also reports that it is currently conducting classification and compensation studies, and any insights and the positions that were audited will be released at a future date. For fiscal year 2024. The office reports that the engineer series classification and compensation audit was completed and updates to the classification plan are being prepared for modification. Additionally, the office reports that it has completed occupation studies for the Office of Law, county Attorney and state Attorney series and the results are under reviewed by the respective agencies. Also, the office reports that the county is currently in collective bargaining negotiations with all ten bargaining units for fiscal year 2025 through fiscal year 2027. As proceedings are confidential, specific discussions and offerings cannot be shared until the agreements are finalized, but it is anticipated that any final agreements will be obtained by March 1, 2024. And lastly, I just would like to say a couple of the key accomplishments for fiscal year 2024 that the office provided. It launched the countywide classification and compensation audit, including focus groups, job analysis, questionnaires and market analysis, and also it implemented new system generated benefit confirmation statements to document open enrollment changes. Additionally, it negotiated lower co pays for primary care, urgent care, and specialist visits for calendar year 2024, as well as conducting I nine reverifications for all employees onboarded virtually during the pandemic as required by the Department of Homeland Security. Also, it provided 2115 Prince George's county youth with employment opportunities and enriching educational experiences through county funded and business funded partnerships that is the end of my report. Thank you. Thank you so much. All right, mister early, did you have anything to add? Nothing at this time. Nothing at this time. Thank you very much. All right, welcome acting Director Jared McCarthy. Please introduce your team and then launch into your presentation. Absolutely. Good morning. Committee chair Watson, deputy or vice chair Harrison, and committee member Oriada. I want to just thank you for having us. Also want to thank Josh Hamlin's team working through this budget with us. As you're aware, I've been the acting director since January 1, when Director Sean Stokes matriculated out of the county. So with me today, working from my right down, I have Deputy Director Jatana Stewart Ponder. Many of you may know she is our lead on all employee labor relations. She's currently in and leading negotiations. So that's where she's spending most of her time, God bless her. I wouldn't want to do it every day. Next to her is deputy director Valerie Farrar. Val, as all of you know, has been in the county a very long time. We're very proud to have her as our newest deputy director. She really is leading what we consider to be the core functions of HR. You know, recruitment, ensuring that all of those transactional paperwork that just follows every employee through their career, that all of those things are done, done timely. So Val leads that unit. Sitting next to her is Tiffany Childs. She is the HR manager of background and compliance for public safety. Just wanted to make sure, in case we had any questions in that arena, that we had the individual here, excuse me, who could answer those? And then to my left is Jennifer Black. Many of you know Jen as well. She's been in the county a very long time, and she's the individual that actually puts together my budget. So if we have any number number questions, those are going directly to jedi. And I don't know if we were able to bring up the PowerPoint or not. If not, I can just go through it on paper, and then we can go from there. Looks like we may be having some technical difficulties. So the first page was really just our mission and vision statement. We wanted to make sure that you had that really nothing there that we need to go through, but it's important that you understand the mission and vision of HR. The next slide is our organizational structure. We have the director's office, labor and employee relations unit, talent management and acquisition, what you might have called recruitment back in the day, people, operations, benefits, administration, pension and retirement services. And on that, I did just want to point out one of our associate directors is missing here today. It was Candace Awa Gonzalez. She wanted to be here today, but unfortunat", "esg_v1": [{"name": "County Office of Human Resources", "insights": [{"observation": "The office strives to provide county agencies with qualified applicants to fill vacancies in a timely manner.

And on that, I did just want to point out one of our associate directors is missing here today. It was Candace Awa Gonzalez. She wanted to be here today, but unfortunately she is out on medical leave. So I just did want to make her apologies. If we have any questions around benefits and pension, we'll do the best we can to answer them, or we may need to follow up. All right, so there we wanted to talk about how we touch the county executives proud priorities. You know, we are working to retain a high level workforce here. We know recruitment is an issue. It's a. Recruit recruitment is an issue statewide. It's actually an issue nationally. So it's one of the things we know. We've heard you've had a lot of questions for the other agencies. One of the things I think we are proud of is, if you look, going into the hiring freeze, many agencies have been able to reduce their vacancy rates to rates that they haven't seen in a long time. I mean, you heard from ocs today that they're at 5%, 3%. Those are the kind of rates that, quite frankly, many agencies haven't seen in the past three or four fiscal years. And a lot of that comes from their partnership with HR. So one of the initiatives that really we worked on was time to fill for the non public safety agencies. We set a target date of 87 days, and that's consistent with best practices in the government world. And most of our agencies are beating that. The next one we're working on for this fiscal year is public safety time to fill a little more challenging because you have backgrounds, you have state requirements that don't exist for your normal employee, not your normal, your non public safety employee. So we're certainly, we are cognizant of our need to really help our county partners with recruitment. Our other area of proud priorities, summer youth employment program, everyone knows it. It's one of the also Brooks priorities. I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking on that. The thing I will say is, I think we're most proud of, and we really want to thank the chief of staff's office, is we have worked diligently to obtain federal funds for that program, and we're able to obtain, you know, several million dollars over the next couple of fiscal years for that fund. With that money, we're able to help as many young people as we can learn the strong attributes of a good work ethic, how to work in a professional environment. So we're certainly very proud of that program. And Miss Farrar can answer any questions you have on that. And then obviously, we've already talked about the public safety recruitment process. That is our next focus. There we go. It's now up and then going into a couple of other areas of focus, digitization and automation. Almost every county agency that comes in front of you talks about how we are constantly trying to keep up with technology, we're constantly trying to implement best practices, and we're constantly trying to get away from paper. I want to thank oit. They've done a great job helping us with that. Obviously, we know we have business improvements again. Time to fill. We're working on that with every agency. You know, we think health department's been a great example. They've struggled for years, but in the past six months, they have really been able to fill positions and fill them quickly. So that's, you know, a partnership between OMB, the agency and OhRm. Obviously, we're working on a number of policy and guidance issues. You will see the collective bargaining agreements when they're done. They always cross the council for legislation. We are still in that process. We imagine that process will take a while this year, just given a number of factors. It's an election year, it's a tough budget year. The budget is not passed yet. Many of our union partners want to see, you know, what action the council takes before they're willing to commit. So all of those factors come into play. And we anticipate that hopefully in the summertime and again, hopefully before you go out on break, we'll at least be able to submit the legislation. Some of it may be to taken up, some of it may need to be taken up in the fall. And then the last piece we are working on our performance metrics for our employees. We've been in a bit of a pilot program for the g scale, and it's one of those things that we're looking to set realistic goals for employees, not just have the high level are you good at customer service, are you good and diligent at your job? Are you timely on what it is? That's expectations for you. It's really drilling down and saying, this is the plan for you for the next year. These are the specific goals that we're asking you to complete. And every manager walks through that process. And as you can imagine, my goals flow down to my deputies. Those goals flow down to their managers, and that's really how it's supposed to look. So, moving on to the next slide, just wanted to give you some numbers. I won't go through every one of these, but as you can see, we're at the moment we have 6671 authorized positions. 60% of those sit in the public safety agencies. And we just provide some other graphics there.

I won't go through every one of these, but as you can see, we're at the moment we have 6671 authorized positions. 60% of those sit in the public safety agencies. And we just provide some other graphics there. I think one of the most important ones is the 1750 who have telework agreements on file with OHRM. That is a recruitment tool. We all understand that telework is very important to our professional class of work. But we also understand with that 60% of employees in public safety agencies that our public safety agencies, they simply don't have the ability to telework, especially, obviously, the uniformed officers. And then there's a determination about within the agency how they treat their civilian employees. And a lot of that is just, can they effectively telework and still support the uniformed officers? That's a question each public safety agency has to answer for itself. So we give you some just background on employee race and ethnicity. This is the current makeup of what the county employee population looks like. These are our Fy 24 accomplishments. You know, we started a new orientation program that has been very effective. We've gone back to in person orientation. A lot of that is the requirements of the federal government. As you know, we were doing online I nine verifications. And then, lo and behold, after Covid, the feds came back to us and said, no, we now need you to go back. And every person that you hired during COVID and you did an online verification, we need to have you physically reverify those people in person again. So some of these things are driven by changes in regulation. Some of these are things that we are working on because we know there's issues. We're streamlining the background process for crossing guards and correctional officers. We've been working very closely with both the police department and the Department of Corrections to try to fill those gaps. We certainly understand that while it's something that everyone wants to see done quickly, these are things that, again, crossing guards, they're actually state regulations that apply to them. We have to meet certain state mandates as to background checks for them. As you can imagine, nobody wants somebody that say on the child sex offender registry to work as a crossing guard because there was too quick of a background process. So things like that, we are mandated by the state to do so. It does create a bit of bureaucracy, but we are moving forward. We are also working on a new EEO process. As you can imagine, in a county government of this size, we get EEO complaints. Any business of this size would. And we're working on a really a process to streamline investigations and make sure that not only the employees but the managers know where to go because quite frankly, your average manager is really not prepared to undertake an EEO investigation. It needs to be handled by professionals. We're working on various administrative procedures for the CAO. We've also launched mandatory supervisory training. We're doing a lot of training around bias in the workplace. I know I just took, I believe it was six separate charrettes of training about bias in the workplace in all forms. And that's really, you know, to make sure that we have a high functioning, high class employee population, it's important to make sure that we do these types of trainings. And then lastly, again, we talk about the telework agreements because it really is a recruitment tool. And then trying to speed this up for you, if I can. I just wanted to talk about the open enrollment process. As you know, benefits is one of the primary things that we provide to all employees in the county. So we just give you some statistics there. One of the things we really were proud of was lowering the co pays. You know, it's one of the great complaints that we hear about from employees that is a barrier to medical care is the high dollar value of a copay. So where we're able to reduce those, it certainly is a benefit to our employees and hopefully the healthier employees they work, they're not out on leave as much. So it certainly benefits the county to do this cost benefit analysis. As you see the suburb youth, I keep calling it employment program and I know Val keeps shooting me the side eye. It's the enrichment program, but wanted to give you some numbers there of eligible candidates. And these are our FY 25 planned initiatives. We're working on a robust veterans hiring initiative to include veterans preference and recognition consistent with state law. Probably one of the biggest contracts short of trash in the county is the benefits contracts. They run into the millions of dollars. We are going to go back out on the street, as we call it, with an RFP for medical, vision, dental, all of the above. We're also going to include supplemental benefits.

It's the enrichment program, but wanted to give you some numbers there of eligible candidates. And these are our FY 25 planned initiatives. We're working on a robust veterans hiring initiative to include veterans preference and recognition consistent with state law. Probably one of the biggest contracts short of trash in the county is the benefits contracts. They run into the millions of dollars. We are going to go back out on the street, as we call it, with an RFP for medical, vision, dental, all of the above. We're also going to include supplemental benefits. And those are things like a lot of people have legal plans, a lot of people have affleck, things like that we're going to go out for. And then obviously investment consulting for the pension plan and HR as well. We're working on implementation of the Maryland time to Care act. That's the medical family leave insurance program that the state passed last year. They extended it this year, the implementation date. We are working with Mako as well as the Maryland boards of Education to join basically a group insurance program for that. And then as we've discussed, we're working on time to fill in digitization. The last thing I'm really going to touch in depth is the Maryland Police Accountability act of 2021. As you know, that implemented a lot of mandates that required trial boards and a whole bunch of other things that the police department had to initiate. But HR also was required to initiate. We're doing mental health checks down on our officers. That was one of the primary things that this legislation required. It was, you know, not only are we moving beyond just physical health, so the physical agility and ability tests, but now we have to do the mental health assessment. And as you can imagine, with over 1600 law enforcement officers in the county, because this includes sheriffs, it includes police officers, even includes fire marshals, because many of our fire marshals are actually covered under the Law Enforcement act because they have arrest powers and the ability to carry handgun as a part of their job duties. So this was one of the big lifts that we've undertaken. We're working with some health partners to really help us through this and to make sure that we've been able to timely implement all of these state obligations. And that's really the end of my presentation and just want to turn it over to the committee. But again, thank you for having us this morning. Thank you so much. And before I turn to my colleagues, I want to ask some questions first instead of going last this time. So just a few questions. And thank you so much. I appreciate you all, and thank you for all the great work that you do. So don't take my questions personally. Just want to ask in regard to, I didn't hear you talk about classification studies at all. So I should have. Councilmember? Yes, because I just want to get some information on that. And I just want to make a request for a list of the studies that are currently in progress or plan for the remainder of this year and plan for next year and any completed studies that you've done. So we touched upon that as one of the FY 24 initiatives. But I knew you were going to ask, so I figured I'd answer your specific questions because I've heard them and all the other. So here is the in broad strokes, and then I'll give deputy director Farrar the chance to give you any specifics. So we have hired a company by the name of Evergreen to do a county wide that exempted a couple of classification studies that were already underway. So we already had underway the engineers and the plan reviewers in D PI because that was an issue. So that study has completed that legislation was submitted to the council about two or three weeks ago. I know Miss Skinner will correct me. I know it was introduced. I was going to say, I think it's been set for a committee hearing. So that's moving forward. And what you'll see is there's recommendations on grade and compensation. So we also have completed compensation studies for the state's attorney's office as well as the county attorney's office, because again, those were priorities. We were losing, you know, qualified staff. We were having a hard time recruiting. Evergreen is essentially covering everything else. They are looking at community developers. They are looking at our administrative assistant class. They're looking at our administrative specialist class. I mean, they are looking at over 100 classifications in the county. They've taken over 1000 employee surveys and other data points. They are benchmarking our salaries against the entire metro area. You know, we made recommendations as who they should check, the usuals, DC, Montgomery county. But we also asked them to look at, say, Baltimore county. Because if you look at population wise and even some demographics, Baltimore county is a good match for us. So we are, and Miss Farrar is meeting with them weekly. We anticipate that we will have an internal report for the county executive staff, mister early and others to be able to go through in the summer that will obviously have a price tag associated with it. We'll make some decisions from there. And then certainly some classes will need legislation because we're going to shrink or compress them or we're going to abolish some classes of work altogether. One example I would give, and this is just an example, but we have a class of work called general clerks. Almost nobody hires general clerks anymore. We hire into more specific roles. One of the places we're working is oit, because OIT is having difficulty hiring people in. You know, and you heard it from Mister McGibbon, the way our current class spec reads, it's not very exciting for people that want to be on the cutting edge of it. And as we know, Miss Gibson keeps winning awards for her it. So she is on the cutting edge.

And as we know, Miss Gibson keeps winning awards for her it. So she is on the cutting edge. But we need to update what are what we're asking our employees and what our classification standards talk to. So to answer the short question, we hope to not hope. We anticipate that the study will be done by summer. So we're projecting just before the end of the fiscal year, we hope is where it will land, that we will then have those conversations, then be able to come back with what the plan actually is. And does that cover all departments? Yes, I know. Department of Health also mentioned that they're struggling a lot. So they are covered in that it covers. So when I say over 100 classifications, it's everything from attorneys to managers to everything. And it's all departments. And that's why I said we've had over 1000 employees participate in the questionnaire that they sent out. Okay, thank you. And to kind of piggyback on something you mentioned about. I know, I've heard it. I thought in another presentation earlier about marketing to millennials and our younger generation, you know, how are we marketing positions and what's the benefit of working for the county? And I'm going to turn that over to Miss Farrar. Good morning. Okay, so we have hired some young adults. We're working with our youth at work to help us with our marketing for county positions. We have. We're benchmarking various jurisdictions and working with agencies to ensure that we're using relevant verbiage in our recruitment announcements. Because although we're the recruiters, the SME's are within the agencies that are hiring for those positions. We are working very closely with the agencies and looking at the current market data. We're updating our class specifications to ensure that the nature, variety of work as well as the skills that are needed for that work are relevant in today's market. We're updating our standards so that it is more amenable to what it needed rather than what has been. So a lot of our recruitment and we're looking at. We're actually going out into the streets. So our teams are out there. We've hired two hispanic and bilingual recruiters to help us work in those areas. But we're at hiring events, we're at community events. We are working with the. Was that the diversity equity inclusion officer to ensure that our marketing is also inclusive of all individuals, veterans, older workers, youth workers. We're working with each population to ensure that we're attempting to attract those individuals. Val, give an example just of how many times in a month, a week, quarter that you're actually physically out there. We are out at least maybe four times a month. I'm gonna say once a week. Our team is out in the streets. We have an event coming up, I think it's May 16. Working with employee Prince George's. They're having a multicultural, multi bilingual event coming up at Hyattsville. We're at the latino professional mixer. We're at Prince George county public school systems at their CTE program events. Wherever we can fit in. Can we get those flyers or information? Because absolutely all the time. You know, how can I get hired by the county? It's a struggle, you know, and I don't have anything right now that I can market to my constituents to say, here you go. Except go to the website. We will get you the updated list because we have these scheduled out, and we'll make sure you get the update. That would be great. Absolutely. Even updating our website. So our website is boring. It is, it is. It is not attractive. It does not engage. It's not interactive. And so we have a comprehensive strategic planning unit is working to help us make it more exciting, colorful, showing individuals working. What are the benefits of working for Prince George's county? And it's not going to be so siloed. So you have to go here for recruitment and here for better. Oh, that would be great. It's a career hiring event page, so you can look forward to that at the beginning of the next fiscal years. Okay. Thank you. Another question. You mentioned your time to fill goal, or you've reached that goal, 87 days, right? Yes. And, you know, although I do hear some concerns from constituents about, you know, the fact that they've applied for the position and they've been shared that they're going to get an interview and they don't hear back for months. So how are we working to kind of take care of that communication? So that's one of the struggles that we really have, and that's really on the agency side, because the agency is, who holds the interview, who schedules the interview, and we've been working with our agency partners to try to create that framework of, you should let candidates know if they're not getting an interview or if they've gone through the interview and they're not successful after you've made that offer. There's a lot of administrative tasks that I think sometimes it's just when you're overloaded with work, it's easy to forget sometimes to do these close the loop type of tasks.

There's a lot of administrative tasks that I think sometimes it's just when you're overloaded with work, it's easy to forget sometimes to do these close the loop type of tasks. So once we hand off the candidate pool, it really then shifts to the agency to do the interviews, the communication, and then HR only gets back involved once an offer letter is drafted. So that whole centerpiece of the interview process sits with our agency partners. Very interesting. So what's the process? So once you're, once a job comes available. So then what's the process? Do you hold, do you wait until you receive all candidates until it closes before you push the candidate information over to the agency? We do, yes. So there's really five or six phases that we have broken down and this is how we track it. So the first phase is creating the posting that's on HR. The agency reaches out to us and says, hey, we want to hire an engineer. Then we do the job. Advertisement working with the agency again to make sure that we have the lingo right, whatever it is, consistent with the class spec. Then once the candidates come in, we wait until the job is closed, meaning the posting is closed. Then there's the evaluation of the candidates, and that's on HR as well, meaning do they meet the minimum quality? Sometimes we work with our agencies. If it's a rather large number of applicants, like, do you want us, how do you want us to look at this and screen this? Or do you just want all 73 applicants? Sometimes the agency wants to go through all of them. Sometimes they want us to look for certain key attributes, like this amount of experience, or they have this in their background. Once we're done with that phase, it shifts over to the agency. So then you're in phases, you know, four and five, which is you go into the screening, what we call screening. But that's the interview process. The agency handles that. They do the scheduling. They pull together the interview panel, they pull together the interview questions. We're there as a resource if they need us. And then it ultimately boils down to they. However, it works, because many agencies do a two step process. So you'll have your hiring managers maybe recommend two or three candidates to the director, and then the director will want to interview the top two or three candidates. So if you're doing a two step process, that adds in a layer. Not all agencies do it that way. Some do, some do it only for upper level positions. And then it's at that point where they communicate back to HR that this is the preferred candidate, this is the salary we want to offer, and then we do that analysis to make sure it's consistent with the county regulations. So all of that breaks down to our target is 87 days. And many agencies, I can tell you in this last quarter, are beating that. You know, like, I can look at the Department of Social Services. They were at 32 days on average. That means they had a tight interview panel. They were ready to go. They scheduled their candidates quickly, and that's really where a lot of time can be lost. Yeah, because, I mean, not being able to fill these funded positions in a timely manner is not good. But. So does every agency have a dedicated HR person? They do. It's often for a small agency, that person may wear multiple hats, whereas a big agency may have three four. I mean, the police department. Val, how many? Eight or nine. About eight or nine, yeah. So our biggest agency is public safety. They have multiple people helping them. And also because they have the background check issue and all of that, smaller agencies like the Office of law that has 50 or 60 people, they may have one individual that does not only their budget, their it, but also their HR. Right. And speaking of public safety, you know, that's always something the fire department brings to my attention, that they have a really tough time filling their positions or it's the timeframe, really. That's a problem for them. So you mentioned that there's a time to fill goal for that. But I don't know. How does that look from your perspective in regards to working with them to kind of lessen that time to get people hired? So we have just launched that initiative. We had opening meetings about a month and a half ago. We are looking at a goal. Val, do you have the specific number? The goal for public safety will be 150 days. That's to include the background and medical process. And that's where a lot of, where we're the slowest is, as you know, the state mandated background check, especially for police officers, it takes a while. Scheduling them for their medical takes a while because you're funneling, as you know, and I think the chief testified about this, Chief Aziz, he may have 1000 candidates, and by the time he shakes through all of those steps, he may only end up with 70 or 80 that clear every component of the background or medical or the mental health check. So it really, it's a large, you start off with a large volume to get down to a small volume, unfortunately. Right.

We are looking at a goal. Val, do you have the specific number? The goal for public safety will be 150 days. That's to include the background and medical process. And that's where a lot of, where we're the slowest is, as you know, the state mandated background check, especially for police officers, it takes a while. Scheduling them for their medical takes a while because you're funneling, as you know, and I think the chief testified about this, Chief Aziz, he may have 1000 candidates, and by the time he shakes through all of those steps, he may only end up with 70 or 80 that clear every component of the background or medical or the mental health check. So it really, it's a large, you start off with a large volume to get down to a small volume, unfortunately. Right. And, you know, I heard, I guess, like I said from the fire department that a lot of the time that it takes to fill the position, you know, they have the qualified candidates come in, but then because it takes so long, they go somewhere else. So that's a, you know, a concern. It is. So one of the things we have proposed, and we are, I think as HR, we have not necessarily landed on the solution to this, but we want to give candidates a window. And this is something that we haven't done in the past. As you know, we've had sort of floating classes. And what I mean is they put together enough candidates to get a class. So that way 50 candidates go through fire school or 50 candidates go through the police training. And that's just been, they usually wait till they get enough candidates to schedule that class, and we hear the same thing, that we're losing candidates so what we're proposing, and again, this is all in the proposal stage, is that we provide candidates with a specific window. If you apply between, we're just going to say January 1 and March 31, you're going to go into the class that's scheduled April 1. If you apply between April 1 and June 1, you're going to go into the class that's scheduled July 1. We're going to pick class dates in advance, and no matter how many people we get, we're going to move forward so that way we don't lose those recruits. The recruits have a sense of, okay, I've applied in this time frame. If I make it through the background, I will be in this class. That would be great. When do you plan to kind of implement? So we are in discussions with all of our partners now. Our test is really, we are working with corrections, the sheriffs first crossing guards. Those are our first group of priorities. We are working with police and fire, but because they are the much larger agencies, we're working with them, and it's going to take a little more time. Right. And I understand, but it really, really impacts over time. It does. And that's a huge issue for me, especially with our public safety, and they're just getting burned out. So, yeah. Last question, and I will move on to my colleagues. In regard to the crossing guards, I know that there's been some kind of, you know, loosening of some of the restrictions so we can kind of fill those positions. You mentioned that, you know, the state mandates have been, of course, very strict, but I know we kind of have a new process for that. So can you talk to that? Yeah. Miss Ferrari will address that with Miss Childs. That'd be great. Yes. So we didn't really loosen the requirements. What we did is we started to use the state mandate requirements. We had the police department as well as the Office of Human Resources management probably over provided over requirements. We tested more than what we needed to test in the medical. We did more backgrounds than we needed to do. And so we took a look at our process first. We looked at our class specification to determine the eligibility requirements, and we did modify that based on benchmarking and community standards. There was no need to really have a crossing guard at a certain age or have a driver's license or have other requirements own a vehicle or anything of that nature. Those were just some artificial barriers that had already, has always been in the process, which we were able to remove out of the process. Then we looked at our medical standards and we looked at what was required by state, and that is the requirements that we're using. As far as testing, we had to, we did reduce or the level of the hearing test. We used a. I'm not going to know, Tiffany knows an audiogram test, and I get audiogram, which is more than what was needed. We now can reduce a different type of hearing test for our crossing guards. So we started that. And with that, we were able to make some changes to recruit and initiate more hires. And I think the important piece, and Miss Childs can touch on this briefly, but we've created a weekly meeting between the police department and miss Childs to move these along. Miss Childs, who do you meet with just on a regular basis? Give the council chair a bit of background. Sure. We meet with the police personnel division. They're responsible for the recruitment in the agency for the school crossing guards, as well as the crossing guard supervisor or whoever they designate as the designee for that meeting. And some of the command staff from the police department. We meet with them every week to review the candidates who are in our pipeline, what we need to do next, and make sure whoever's coming into the pipeline, we can process officially. And have you moved forward with hiring some of those positions? Filled some of those positions. So I think, sorry, last week, we have referred, I think, eight additional candidates. So there are candidates who are with the police chief for final authorization for hire and who will eventually be hired by the police department. So I think there are eight in the pipeline to be hired at this point. And how many total do we need crossing guards? How many positions are there available?

I believe it started off with about 80 vacancies. And we have, with the new process, we have slowly but surely been able to start to fill some of those positions. So I think that with the new process that we have, I think in a few weeks we're going to have what we're going to call a hiring surge. All of those that have applied, we're going to have on site interviews. We're going to move them so they don't have to leave after the interviews. They're going to go ahead and have their fingerprinting and be able to schedule their medicals all at once one day. That would be great, because we need to get our police officers back into their normal jobs fighting crime. So thank you so much for answering and indulging me, my colleagues. Mister vice chair, did you have some questions, quick questions, especially in the interest of time. You talked about the outreach to younger generations and the work that you're doing in the community each and every year. It's just more of a statement. You probably already are doing this. So, you know, but partnering up with our universities as well. There's a lot of young scholars that are attending schools across the state of Maryland, Towson University, Bowie State, University of Maryland, and, you know, Prince George's community college. And I think that would be a great segue, especially with the major that they might be majoring and speaking with the dean of those certain areas that could help with recruitment. And so that's just more of a statement. I got a question about what constitutes a medical health check. Mental health check you spoke about just randomly, you know, making sure that. But what constitutes that in regards to the police Accountability act? Yeah. Okay. So the legislation wasn't clear. So that was our challenge. We had to figure out what that needed to look like. From partnering with the police department and looking at what neighboring jurisdictions were doing, we identified two assessments that were proven in the psychological space to evaluate PTSD and depression anxiety. So we administered those two assessments to all law enforcement officers to meet the requirement. Okay. All right, thank you. And then you talked about the 6700 something employees that we have here in Prince George's county government. And as you know, at one point, I was an employee of the state, and I noticed that the state gives you a multitude of choices when it comes to health insurance. Here we only have two. So is there a rhyme or reason why we only have two, first of all? And is there an opportunity to where our employees could possibly have another option? Because I think that creates. Could be wrong, but I think that creates a monopoly of where you only get two choices. And certain insurance companies offer different type of services than others. And so that might be more important to the person when they make that decision about the different choices that each company offers. I understand we have Kaiser, but, you know, that's a one stop shop, you know, and I get the reason why, but you only have one other choice. So I just talk about the diversity and making sure that we have some choices here in the county. So it's something we'll certainly look at as, you know, when. When you go out to bid on these, you're always worried about price point because insurance is. It literally is the most expensive contract. When you start to add it up year over year and you get some savings. If you have large buckets serviced by, you know, one group, another group, when you start to have multiple providers that are providing service to smaller and smaller buckets, your cost per individual actually goes up so that's one of the things we look at. Certainly I understand your point of the ability for selection. Obviously, the state has far more employees, more bargaining units as well. Some of the insurance selection is driven by collective bargaining agreements, not for us and the state as well. So certainly something we understand, certainly something that we've heard, and certainly something that when we go out to the RFP, that we will be asking for various proposals from all of the major carriers. You know, even I think the state has four, but maybe three. My memory doesn't serve me well here. That comes with age. But I just think that even if we had three choices, it gives the employees the opportunity to make a decision. And, you know, I'm not here to give my own personal opinion. I just. This is just about choice at this point. Yep, we hear you. Go ahead. Go ahead, mister. No, I was just going to reinforce what UCL McCarthy was saying. The difference on an organization, our size, the difference between offering, getting a single bidder and saying, okay, you're going to have the pool, aside from Kaiser or something like, like that. And having multiple bidders could mean millions of dollars of additional costs for the county and additional costs for the employee. So yes, there is more flexibility.

On the other hand, it's a big cost item. And then lastly, just one, I know this is probably a hot button question, but when you see the evolution of medical cannabis, that happens in our community, you know, and we're doing zoning on medical cannabis, we're looking at businesses that have cannabis companies in Prince George's county. One of the, I think it's a discriminatory question that is asked on the public safety side of have you done cannabis? And if one someone says, you know, they're nervous, no, I've never done cannabis. And then they go apply somewhere else in another jurisdiction and say that they have done, they automatically get red flagged and they're kicked out of the process. They don't even go forward. Right. So I don't know where that question comes in at or if a medical card is needed for an applicant that is applying to be in some sort of public safety career path. I think that it's something that we have to look at, honestly, because I think that's an antiquated question, number one. Number two, the DEA just dropped the classification this week on that, so we have to move with time when it comes to that. So let me, let me just say this. That is an evolving area. You are 100% correct. We have been, you know, communicating with not only the agency partners but the office of law, to make sure we understand, you know, what is permissible, what's not. Yeah. At least for public safety, correctional officers and police officers that include sheriffs as well. The drug question and issue is controlled by MPTC. Maryland Police Training Commission for the fire department. A lot of their issues come from, are you able to prescribe medication or not? And so if you are an EMT who has the ability in the ambulance to give medication, there are certain national standards under NFPA that they follow. So it is definitely evolving field. We hear you. We are currently, Val, correct me if I'm wrong, but we are following MPTC standards. We have not gone above. Okay. Yeah, because for a while the police department had more rigorous standards than MPTC. And we said why are we, why are we doing more? Let's do what the state requires. And then the same, it's the same discussion with the fire department. So it is an evolving area, obviously, as they take it off of a schedule one drug that will have legal ramifications for sure. And we'll continue to look at that. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you all for all that. You all doing too. You all doing great work. Thank you. Thank you very much. Councilmember Oriada. Yes. Thank you for your presentation. You talked about the contracts going to be open again for healthcare benefits. What's the timeline on that? So open enrollment happens in October? No, I'm sorry. Oh, so I'm working, I'm working backwards. Okay. So if to have a contract in place, you figure we are looking at open enrollment of 26 because you will do, the contract would be awarded in say, early 26. So that way the data transfer can happen because you've got to transfer the data of all 6000 plus employees plus retirees. And then you've got to make sure there's no glitches in that data. So working backwards from that, if we're looking to award in early 26, that means we're looking to go through the contract process in 25. So our goal is to issue the RFP, if we can, this fall, give people an opportunity, meaning October, November, we would have responses due into the new year. So then the evaluation committee. Because healthcare contracts are difficult, it takes a long time to evaluate them. We usually have an outside expert partner with us as well to do the costing for us. It usually takes anywhere from three to six months to do the evaluation. So that's really the timeline if you look at it that way. Okay, good to know. I've been working with the committee director because, you know, the council, we pass resolution to work on the audit and so our goal is to start with just questions. Right. Giving you time to like dive into like key questions and before we meet, because we know we have a tight turnaround, but we wanted to make sure that aligned with the contract. So that's good to know. And another question, you know, just to go back to like another thing that we did as a council, one of the issues we had was with our providers and our ability to get service inside of the county. As we know, Kaiser does not have the ability to give birth in the county. Obviously as a county, that's one of the things that we're trying to fix, having better off providers and options and to see those numbers change. And so we worked on a policy change that would stop that from happening for us to have providers that don't have the services inside the county. Do you see any issues with the legislation that we passed? Things that maybe is a loophole that wouldn't yield us to the result that we're looking for, which is that when we renegotiate contracts that that won't be able to happen again, that we'll have a provider that doesn't allow us to have serv", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Various Carriers", "insights": [{"observation": "The difference between offering, getting a single bidder and saying, okay, you're going to have the pool, aside from Kaiser or something like, like that.

Things that maybe is a loophole that wouldn't yield us to the result that we're looking for, which is that when we renegotiate contracts that that won't be able to happen again, that we'll have a provider that doesn't allow us to have services like that in the county. So let me, let me say this, councilmember, I have not drilled that deep yet. I wouldn't want to just give you an off the cuff answer. It is certainly something that we'll look at. But I will tell you this, we are cognizant of that fact. And one of the things when we go out for RFP that we always evaluate and judge providers on, it's not only cost, but it's their ability to service the county population. Because we hear it from employees, the last thing they want to do is when we say we award to a new provider, they don't want to hear that their doctor's not in network. They don't want to hear that the physical therapy facility that they go to is no longer in network. They don't want to have to find a new healthcare team. So we are, we are definitely aware of that and is definitely an evaluative factor. Okay, good to hear. And then wanting to understand the hiring process a little bit because I know you talked about us kind of getting to the goal of reducing the timeline, but I had this issue. I'm not sure if some of my colleagues, when I'm trying to bring in employees and they said that the timeline for like part time and a thousand hours has changed. And so now, for example, we could get them hired faster. But now they're saying it takes a long time. I think it's like three weeks automatically. Onboarding. Is that something that's internal to us? Is that because what it was explained to me is that because of timelines that align for you all with, like, training and onboarding, it's making it harder for us to bring on staff? That may be the alignment with orientation, is what you're talking about, that we have standing orientation that we try to push all employees into. So that may be the issue that you're running into. That is if you're hiring somebody in between the scheduled orientations that you're being asked to wait. Okay. And I think, I don't know if other people have experienced this. I know for me, I hired someone that had quit their job, and then they weren't even able to start on time, and so they went, we already paid people with a lag. And so I felt really horrible that because of that process, they went even longer without getting their first paycheck. And so just making sure that we, like every agency, is very clear about that, because once we give an offer, we were on the assumption that they would have a different start date, and so they went even longer without getting paid. And so I think that could have a negative impact, too. And we'll certainly make sure we communicate with, with Miss Jenkins. A lot of that is probably a communication issue that I think that as long as we're clear on when the orientation dates are, Miss Farrar will definitely follow up with Miss Jenkins. Thank you. And then I know there was an issue with access to, like, pay stubs in the portal for some, at least for. Again, I'm not sure if the port is the same for everyone, but I know that my staff said they didn't have access to their pay stubs. They had to request access. I know some of them recently, just now got it. I know there was some state legislation, too, around access to pay stubs. Was that just our internal process, or is there an issue with people being able to go on the portal and access to their pay stubs? I would think that was a tech issue. Okay. Because I'm not aware. I mean, we don't control that in any way. That's through its. Ess is the portal that we call it the employee. And it. There are certain blackout periods, meaning as it updates, you can't. But those are usually in the evening. So I would think that was a tech issue, and I would address that with Miss Gibson. Okay. Thank you. Now, if they're new employees, I will say they do have to create that account. No, these weren't new. They were trying to move, and then we had to request it because they couldn't have, like, they didn't have proof and pay stubs. And so it became this whole process with multiple employees, at least from the council. Okay. So I just wanted to see what that issue was. I would definitely follow up with Miss Gibson or her team on that. Awesome. And then also, do we constantly, like, evaluate our offerings when we come to, like, benefits to other jurisdictions or even, I think, the corporate sector? Because one of the things when we're talking about hiring and retention benefits is a huge thing. So have we thought about that just when it comes to making ourselves more competitive? So we do. We look at what our neighboring jurisdictions offer. We look at, you know, sort of the, not only the health offerings, but what are they providing in terms of leave right now? Because the county is part of the state pension system, we have less flexibility there because obviously anything that would impact the state pension that is controlled by the state, state legislation, we don't have the ability to change that.

But on the other pieces, yes, we are absolutely looking at what our competitor jurisdictions are doing. And we're always thinking about, are there better ways to do this? And I think to your point earlier about hiring younger people, I think that's an area that if we can figure out some of the benefits that we offer, and it might not be across the board, but maybe in certain agencies where, like, especially like tech, for example, you know, my fiance is in tech and working remote is a huge thing for them. Right. And so that's, they don't want to work anywhere. They have to come into the office. And so just thinking about those types of things. Sure. And then the last thing, just so I could understand the delay in the hiring process, because you did talk about how sometimes you hand it off to the agency and sometimes it's on their part. So is there a mechanism where you guys kind of pull them back and do training, tell them, hey, these are where you can cut corners on why it's taking them so long, even though it's not in your purview just to say, hey, like, absolutely. That's. So we are tracking on a monthly basis everyone's hiring statistics. Okay. So when we see an agency that is going above the target, we have conversations with the agency. There are standing training with what we call the HRL community. That's the human resource liaison. So we do standing trainings where they can ask questions all of that is really behind the initiative because we understand that if you're not tracking it, if you're not looking at the data, you really don't know what's going on. So we certainly track it on a monthly basis, and we meet with the chief administrative officer pretty much on a quarterly basis to discuss, to see where the pain points are. And one of the focuses we're looking at, and we've heard it as a pain point, is, I just want to backfill a position where somebody's left. I don't want to do anything special. I don't want to change it. I don't want to try to change the salary. I just want to backfill it. So we're working on trying to. To find an expedited solution for that, and that's one of the initiatives that we will be working on into the next fiscal year as well. Okay, my last question is, just one of the things we've talked about, especially in public safety, is hiring more people that are local to Prince George's county and the diversity of people of color, specifically in our fire and police. If we wanted to drill down into that data, we need to talk to you or just the agencies directly and how we're doing better, if we're doing better at that. So race and ethnicity data is one of those things that's tough to not track. But we need to look at what we're obligated by the federal government to track because we do. We fill out an EEO for every two years. I would think you would probably want to talk to both us and the agency, and we would see what data is actually available, because there is data available in SAP as well. But we have to remember it's all voluntary data. You can't mandate that people report. So there are going to be a population of employees that just have no data. Right. Thank you. Thank you so much. Councilmember Dunoga has told me he has no questions. So I see Councilmember Olson has joined us and he has indicated he has a couple of questions. Thank you. And, you know, sorry to just jump in here, but you probably have already covered all this, so I apologize for that. But just in terms of the. And I know you have accelerated the timelines for hiring. I know we need to continue to do better the capacity to get that done with the human resources that we currently have. I mean, I think that many agencies that we've talked to through the budget process have indicated that it just is taking too long to get people on board whether that's fire, whether that's police, whether that's public safety or other agencies, d PI or you name it. So, you know, I think it's really critical that we have the amount of, you know, human resources in the Department of Human Resources to process things and get things through so we don't lose out to other counties. I mean, we're already at a disadvantage in some other, you know, ways in terms of salary and bonuses and whatnot. We want to make sure that we get people through. So, so I'm sure you probably already talked about this extensively. I just have to put it out there. If you already addressed it, I'm happy to talk to my colleagues, but I certainly would want to look at this budget in terms of do we need to put more investment into this department so that we will get out of it more? Sorry about that. Councilmember Olson. From my perspective, I always look at, but if I can fill all of my positions, do I need more? I think at this point, if I can fill all my positions, I would be rocking and rolling.

In this agency, we have a number of vacancies that at this point we're working through the hiring freeze process. We had some pre approved. We're filling those vacancies. And I think with that complement, we have already demonstrated that we were, you know, we are able to get the numbers down because, you know, just for example, we hired 137 people, and these are non public safety. So these are the non public safety agencies in the first quarter of this calendar year. If you look at fiscal year, it's the third quarter, and the average timeline to do that was 70 days, which is well above or well below what the average is. And best practice. Now, certain agencies, yeah, they take longer than others, and some of that is internal capacity to them because as we discussed, HR does. Once we hand off the candidate list, the largest block of time we see is the interview process. So interview, candidate, selection to candidate offer, that's where we see the most time in the whole process. So, yeah, 70 days plus, plus a potential other process. I mean, that's more than two months. It's still a lot. I mean, it seems to be, I understand you're saying industry standard or whatnot, but industry standards, about 90 days. I'd like to also, I guess, understand, is there anything that we can, you don't have positions filled and so how do we fill those positions? What are we up against in filling those positions? You know, we've already addressed this a little bit, but we suffer the same recruitment challenges that every other county government is when you look towards the more specialized positions. And HR is a specialty. It's. It's one where, you know, it's a mix of. Of, you have to understand the rules, the laws, the regulations, and then best practices. We struggle because it's a small pool that you're competing with. And then in this area, which has a lot of HR departments, the federal government absorbs a lot of that capacity. It's no different than, you know, mister early struggles to find good analysts to. Mister McGibbon struggles to find good accountants, and the same with engineers. So I think it's just, you know, we're doing the best we can and we're working within the confines that we can, which is, you know, if. Yeah, if we could raise everyone's salary, $20,000, we'd be recruiting like you couldn't imagine, but we'd have to lay off, you know, half of the county workforce to afford that. So it's that balance. Well, madam chair, I think this bears more discussion among the council. Thank you. Certainly. Thank you. Thank you so much, all of you, for what you do. I do appreciate. I know my questions were, I just want to get us to the point where we need to be, but thank you for all the work you do. Same here. And we appreciate you all. Just a reminder, if you wouldn't mind sending the list over of the classification studies. Absolutely. Great. So I can share with my colleagues and also making sure that we do that social media push for our younger generation. I know you all are probably doing that already, and sending over whatever information that we as council members can send out to our constituents would be great. We'll get you the list of events. Not a problem. Thank you so much, you all. I appreciate you. Thank you. Thank you. All right, we will now move to the revenue authority and bring up Denise Robinson, executive director. All right, welcome. Welcome, Executive Director Robinson. We will start with our policy analysis. Josh Hamlin. Good afternoon. Chair Watson. Vice chair Harrison. Councilmember Doneoga. Councilmember Oriata. Anyone else watching? My name is Josh Hamline. I'm from the budget and policy Analysis Division, and I will be giving the summary budget overview of the revenue authority. Just some sort of prefatory information. Revenue authority is a quasi governmental entity. Its budget is separate from the county's operating budget and is approved by a separate resolution of the council. Along with that, you'll notice in the table on page two of the report that their revenue consists of operating income, managed program income and interest income. Occasionally use of fund balance, not general funding. Their budget for FY 25 proposed is approximately 50.4 million, which is an increase of just over 4 million, or 8.8% over the FY 24 approved budget, and this increase is due primarily to increased operating costs in support of the school bus stop arm camera safety program, increased costs for debt service and bad debt, and an increase in operating costs for the automated speed camera program, and property maintenance and insurance costs. For FY 25, compensation is proposed at approximately 5.2 million, which represents an increase of about $387,000, or 8% over the FY 24 approved level, and that budget includes funding for 77 full time and 32 part time positions, which represents an increase of eight full time positions above FY 24. The authority has reported that as of April 2024, they have seven vacancies, which are, I think, all expected to be filled in fiscal 24. Most notable among these is the chief real estate officer, which has been vacant for some time.

The authority has reported that as of April 2024, they have seven vacancies, which are, I think, all expected to be filled in fiscal 24. Most notable among these is the chief real estate officer, which has been vacant for some time. Also included an information processing specialist, a maintenance technician, parking enforcement supervisor and three parking enforcement officers. Going back to their revenue, as it's noted, a lot of their revenue comes from, or almost all their revenue comes from parking enforcement and then their managed programs, which they operate for several county agencies. These include the false alarm reduction unit, the automated speed enforcement or speed camera program, the Red Light camera program, the school bus stop arm program, and the abandoned vehicle unit. I believe the authority receives a management fee for running each of these programs, which is reflected in their proposed budget. Just a couple highlights. There's detail on each of these programs on pages five through eight of the report, but I did want to just go through the kind of revenues for FY 24 and proposed for 25 for each of them. For the fossil arm reduction unit, FY 24 revenues are exceeding projections. With an anticipated FY 24 revenue at 1.1 million, which is above the 700,000 that was anticipated in the approved budget, expenses would be almost 560,000. For fiscal 25, revenues are projected at 1.5 million, with expenditures projected at roughly 646,000 for the speed camera program. You all heard about this a little bit in the briefing earlier this year, so you know some of the issues surrounding that. That is why revenues for fiscal 24 for the program are not on target due to the vendor issues as well as potential changes in driver behavior, which means that from a public safety perspective, at least in that regard, the program's working program revenues were expected to be about 5.1 million in the 24 budget with with $3.3 million in expenditures. However, as of this month they're projecting fiscal 24 revenues to come in at only 3.1 million with about 2.8 million in expenditures. Fiscal 25 revenues are projected for this program at 4.5 million and expenditures at around 4 million. As you know already, there's a new contract with a new vendor to manage the program and the authority has indicated that once that vendor is kind of fully onboarded and up to speed that these revenues will increase. The red light camera program also revenues are not on target and this the authority has attributed to driver behavior, which again, I guess, is evidence that the program is working. For fiscal 24, 5.4 million in revenues were anticipated with 2.9 million in expenditures. But as of now the projected revenues and expenditures are estimated at 4.2 million and 2.3 million respectively. For fiscal 25, revenues are projected for this program at 4.3 million and expenditures at about up 2.4 million. In contrast to the speed camera and Red Light camera program, the school bus stop arm program is exceeding projections in revenues as of March of 2024. There are almost 1300 pgcps school buses that are equipped with these cameras and the way they work is that when school bus stop arm is extended and a car passes it, the camera takes a picture. The driver of the car gets a $250 ticket. So as of April 2024, fiscal 24 revenues and expenditures are projected to come in a little over 13 million and expenditures at 11.7 million, which exceeds the 9.9 million that was projected in the proposed or the an approved fiscal 24 budget and 8.8 million in expenditures. So this has led to projected revenues for that program at 13 million for fiscal 25 with expenditures at 11.8 million. Some other programs that the authority manages are the Fringelot program for DPWNT. For fiscal 25, the authority is estimating $387,000 payment from DPW and T for the management, monitoring and operation of the fringe lots. This is a $58,000 reduction from fiscal 24 entirely in the maintenance category. The abandoned vehicles unit is going to and net the authority a payment of about 500,000 for managing that program, which is $16,600 increase over fiscal 24 and as mentioned above and is reflected on the table, parking enforcement represents the majority of the budget resources of the authority. The authority has 30 parking enforcement officers who handle parking enforcement throughout the county garages and residential parking areas. There's more information on pages 13 to 15 of the report on parking enforcement and you can find a lot of detail on the authorities, facilities and operating revenues and expenditures on pages nine and ten of the report, as well as on the tables that the authorities supplied, should be at pages 106 to 110 of your revised binder.

Mister early, did you have anything to add? Make sure nothing at this time. All right, thank you. All right, thank you so much. We now turn it over. Denise. Thank you. Robinson. Good afternoon. Chair Watson, vice chair Harrison, and members of the committee, thank you for having us. Today I'm joined by our new CFO, Andrew Pierce, as well as our chief safety and enforcement officer, Tanya James. We also have a representative from the police department, Captain Smith. As you know, we work closely with the police department on several programs that Josh highlighted. So we asked him to join us in case you guys have any questions. All right, so the revenue authority, as Josh said, is a self funded quasi agency. We operate and manage safety and enforcement programs on behalf of the county. We then leverage those funds to invest into economic development projects throughout the county as its development finance agency. Here's a high level. Oh, hold on. Sorry, it's not. Is it one? I think if I push it one more time, it'll blow up. Yeah, it won't move. Yeah, I've been pushing for now. I thought I had it. Okay, there you go. Here's a high level chart of our organization to detail how we're structured. So in addition to working closely with the county executive's office and the county council, we're governed by a board of nine directors. We have six senior staff members, including myself. In addition to the staff you see illustrated here, we have a total of approximately 109 staff members. Most of those individuals, as you can imagine, fall under our safety and enforcement division. Our economic development activities fall under chief real estate officer. And then, of course, we have our back office folks that keep us running, our chief financial officer and our chief human resources officer. Those two divisions. Thank you. We spoke earlier about our mission, and we execute that mission, really by primarily focusing on three core functions. One is obviously our parking enforcement and parking operations. Secondly is the managed programs that we do on behalf of several county agencies, the police department, the school system, DPWNT and the Department of Environment. Those programs include. A few of them are red lights, false alarm, speed, school bus, abandoned vehicle, as well as the fringe lots. Our third kind of pillar is that we are a financial solutions provider for economic development projects throughout the county. Our budget is just reflective of those major core pillars of our organization. I will point out here that the economic development part seems small, but that's not reflective of our total footprint because most of our largely how we participate in economic development activities and projects is by leveraging our bonding capacity, which wouldn't be shown here. So, as we look forward to fiscal year 25, in addition to our current pipeline and goals of generating revenues and addressing constituent concerns, we do have a few additional initiatives we're going to be exploring. One, I know that you guys often hear a lot of complaints about the commercial vehicles being part parked illegally. We have too. And in response to those constituent concerns, we want to develop a commercial vehicle parking lot so that those folks can actually have a parking solution for our residents that own and operate those vehicles. We'll provide under this initiative both monthly and daily parking options. In addition to establishing this lot, we also want to expand our enforcement efforts by establishing a towing program. By enhancing our internal infrastructure, we'll be able to actually tow vehicles that are in violation of county codes, not just the commercial vehicles, but the passenger vehicles that meet impound eligibility as well. And then lastly, we talk a lot about our economic development efforts. We do want to expand our financial toolkit, not just having, not just leveraging our bonds, but exploring other options that we can provide to developers to push economic development activity throughout the county. And lastly, I do just want to highlight the past year kind of some achievements we we've completed or achieved. This is I just completed my first year and so I want to say thank you to my dynamic team. One of those achievements that we're proud of is we issued conduit bonds for the Hamilton Manor project. It's a 245 unit apartment community in Hyattsville, 9% LIHTC project. It was actually the county's first right of first refusal project we did in conjunction with DHCD. Secondly, we worked closely with the RDA and our DCAO Angie Rogers to develop creative solutions to address the parking concerns of the suitla residents during the town square community development. And lastly, I have to give kudos to our deputy director and chief human resources officer, as we did a major or", "esg_v1": [{"name": "County Revenue Authority", "insights": [{"observation": "The CIP program for the authority includes projects like the Hamilton Manor and the UMS Capital Region Medical center parking facility.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}, {"observation": "The authority plans to develop a commercial vehicle parking lot to provide parking solutions for residents who own and operate commercial vehicles and to expand enforcement efforts by establishing a towing program.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The authority works closely with the police department on several programs including red lights, false alarm, speed, school bus, abandoned vehicle, as well as fringe lots.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The authority acts as a financial solutions provider for economic development projects throughout the county.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Received complaints about commercial vehicles parked illegally and plans to develop solutions such as a commercial vehicle parking lot and towing program.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Issued conduit bonds for the Hamilton Manor project, a 245 unit apartment community in Hyattsville which is a 9% LIHTC project.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Collaborated with the RDA and DCAO to address parking concerns of Suitland residents during town square community development.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "County Revenue Authority", "insights": [{"observation": "The CIP program for the authority includes projects like the Hamilton Manor and the UMS Capital Region Medical center parking facility.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}, {"observation": "The authority plans to develop a commercial vehicle parking lot to provide parking solutions for residents who own and operate commercial vehicles and to expand enforcement efforts by establishing a towing program.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The authority works closely with the police department on several programs including red lights, false alarm, speed, school bus, abandoned vehicle, as well as fringe lots.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The authority acts as a financial solutions provider for economic development projects throughout the county.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Received complaints about commercial vehicles parked illegally and plans to develop solutions such as a commercial vehicle parking lot and towing program.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Issued conduit bonds for the Hamilton Manor project, a 245 unit apartment community in Hyattsville which is a 9% LIHTC project.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Collaborated with the RDA and DCAO to address parking concerns of Suitland residents during town square community development.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 12089948, "chunk_end_time": 12494714, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3532?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3532?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=12089"}, {"start": 169000, "end": 175000, "text": "e do want to expand our financial toolkit, not just having, not just leveraging our bonds, but exploring other options that we can provide to developers to push economic development activity throughout the county.

So that's all. Thank you. Open it up for questions. Awesome. Thank you. Congratulations on your first year. Thank you. You've done a great job. You all have done a wonderful job. So vice chair Harrison and his statement, first of all, thank you for your leadership. I know it sounds like a very busy agency, you know, with enforcement and then abandoned vehicles and towing and how you all generate revenue. But my question is, and maybe this is. I don't even know the answer to this, but I'll ask it anyways, this question. Do you. Does the county own any tow trucks? We do not own tow trucks now. No. You don't own any? So we have contracts. Yeah. Yeah. I was wondering if we just had any tow trucks, if we own. I know some other jurisdictions have them, but I was trying to remember if I've ever seen a Prince George's county tow truck. So, no. Have we? Part of the vision moving forward is that something that is just too cost burden, and it's better for us to outsource it, rather than maybe that would have employees that work, especially part of the after hours, if that was possible to. If the county had their own tow trucks. I'll ask Miss James if she wants to add anything, but what I'll say is that we are exploring, as I mentioned, the towing program now and looking at all options and potential strategies to build it out. I don't know if we, you know, other jurisdictions do own their tow trucks. I think they have a little bit of a different demand than we do. And so based on the contracts and relationships that we have, we'd have to figure out what's more cost effective and what makes the most sense for our jurisdiction. And the reason why I brought that up. I saw the slide that talked about the opportunity for trucks, commercial vehicles to park in certain lots. I know we're not in the tow truck business, but, I mean, if we're having parcels of land where we actually had a tow truck or two that would go out in just special circumstances, I don't know from a cost basis, I just didn't know how that would been approached. But I just saw that you all added the component for the parcel of land for people to be able to park, which is very important. That's it. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Council member Riata? Yes. Thank you. Just a few questions about some pending projects in my district, and I apologize. I stepped out if you did cover it. I know that we had. I think last time you presented that there was movement that was going to happen at the Suitland town square, like the next phase of development. I know it's split between your agency, another agency, so if you could just kind of let me know where we are and then remind me on which portion of that is in your budget or in your, excuse me, agency. So we're working closely with RDA. They really, the way it really is, is that RDA will lead a lot of the development efforts, and we will be a party on the finance side. So we're working closely, kind of lock and step on all the parcels now. That's the goal moving forward, to make it more streamlined. A lot of the infrastructure work that has to be completed before the parcels can go vertical is starting to happen now. We're continuing to progress the planning and designing for the vertical stuff or activities, I should say. And so we are still moving forward. It's just, you know, development takes a long time and are we still looking at the next phase being. I think it was condos or more residential, and then we still have the RFP out for the hotel. Is there any more that commercial that's pending in, like, the next fiscal year? There is commercial that's included on parcels a and b. There's a smaller commercial portion that I think RDA is getting ready to fill within the next fiscal year. It is all coming online. Okay. And then also the second project, correct me if it is your age. So you're not the one on old Central set. You all with the school with mission of love. No. No. Okay. And that's it. Thank you. Thank you so much. I know Mister Durnoga had to leave, but Councillor Olsen, did you have any questions? Thank you. Yes. Good afternoon. How are you? Good. How are you? Good, good. I wanted to ask about, you know, the vehicles on, you know, like commercial vehicles and whatnot on our residential streets and, you know, the towing of those. So I know that a lot of times we've seen, in my district, where we'll have people come out, they'll ticket them or give a warning or give a ticket, but then they don't get removed. And, you know, we've got. Right now we've got a big boat that's at an intersection. Like, it's right next to the intersection. And I guess it does have valid tags, but it's at the intersection.

And my understanding is the homeowners moved away and just left it there. That's my understanding. I don't know, but what are we doing to get. And that's not the only case of these vehicles and boats and trailers and all kinds of things. What are we doing to get these off the streets and to better enforce that and get compliance? I think. Well, I don't know the specifics of. Sure. And I understand. I'm not. Yeah. But I think, you know, part of the reason for wanting to do the lot is to say, okay, not only are we having an enforcement solution from the towing perspective, but let's also provide a place for those vehicles to go, because a lot of times we hear they don't have anywhere to park their vehicles. Right. And if our residents are driving them or operating them, we want to give them a place to do that. So that's kind of the genesis behind developing a commercial vehicle parking lot. And on the opposite side of that. Right. Because it has to be an integrative solution or strategy, is the enforcement piece. And so that is why we want to expand our towing capacity, have additional contracts with towing companies to let them know, you know, a lot of times, the tow trucks aren't incentivized when they're abandoned vehicles. So a lot of the conversation right now is about educating them that they're not abandoned, that we're starting to tow on, you know, vehicles that are. That are, you know, folks are driving every day. But that's really kind of the solution right now is to provide a place for folks to park, but in addition to tow those that are impound eligible. Okay, so two follow ups to that. So one is how can we get those towed, like, quicker? I mean, how can we get. I mean, can we just want me to communicate, and my staff has been communicated communicating, but how can we get those? Is there a timeframe that, like, on day, you know, seven, we need to get that out of there, or, like, what? So I'll let miss James kind of walk through the steps. What I will. Two things I want to point out. One is that it's fine if you guys reach out, but I will say for everyone that it's helpful when it goes through 311. Yes. And the reason for that is because it allows us to track it. I can also tell you that our response time is generally less than what. What's quoted to folks, that we are pretty responsive. But if you know something's happening and it's not being resolved, then we definitely want to know about it. Secondly, what I would say is, sorry, we were talking about 311, and then you also asked about the time frame. The time frame, yeah. So I'll let Miss James kind of speak through that, but they do have to receive a certain amount of tickets before we can actually go out and tell. How are you, Councilmember Olaf? Well, thank you. How are you? I'm very well. There are some variables that happen depending upon what type of vehicle it is. So if it is indeed abandoned, generally it's a 48 hours hold or wait, you know, after a warning, at which time we contact the tow company to do a pickup. Miss Robinson mentioned that we are trying our best to also incentivize tow companies to pick up vehicles, particularly those that are not what the police department calls shinies or, you know, someone's going to reclaim the vehicle. So at this point, it's typically trash pickup, and we're at the mercy of the tow companies to give us their space on their lots, things of that nature. So we are working diligently with those tow companies to make sure that we integrate again. We're impounding. All vehicles that are impound have impound eligibility, which increases the reclamation, you know, claims for the token. So this is one of the strategies that we're using with the creation of this new tow unit that we have in house, in our office, generally with abandoned vehicles. Yes. It's about five days for a tow. If it's a heavy commercial vehicle and it's abandoned, that timeframe may extend out to two weeks before the tow companies actually come out and do those tows. Also, it's a limit on the number of tow companies that are able to do large, heavy, what are called vehicle or equipment tows. I think right now, we have contracted two in the county. So if we have large volumes of those, there's a wait period to ensure that there's space freed up for it, and that they have other types of, I believe, laws and policy that they have to follow with trying to tow something, such as, like a freight liner that has trailer attached, things of that nature that they have to follow before they can actually do the tows. But generally, we, you know, if it's a basic passenger vehicle, we're trying to get those off the street within 72 hours. Like I said, the larger the vehicle becomes. You may have more of a wait time because we're looking at space and, you know, premiums on space. Yeah. Okay. And do we need a. Do we need to find a place where some of these non chinese, you know, vehicles can go. That is a part of what we are looking at.

Trying to procure space and looking at increasing, exploring what that looks like for us to actually try to operate on that piece of it. So we are in the exploration phase of looking at how we could best mitigate some of these issues for the future. Okay, that would be great. I'd love to hear more about that as it progresses. Hopefully we can get an update on that, madam chair. And then in terms of yet finding spaces is my other question. Finding spaces, county space that we can have commercial vehicles park at overnight is a key piece to all this. I mean, we understand. I mean, I certainly understand. Sounds like you certainly understand that people's livelihoods depend on that vehicle, but they also can't park on our neighborhood streets with these vehicles. And so I think it does mean that we have to find the spaces. So I know my office. Office been in communication with you about this as well. So how are we progressing on. Maybe I missed, I'm sorry if I missed any discussion about that. I'm so sorry. I was listening, but I. It is one of the things that I said. It's one of our major initiatives for the next fiscal year. We're already starting to work on it. And so once those details are fleshed out, we can come back and make sure that you guys are all aware of the details of it, where it's going to be located so that you can also share it with your constituents, because we want folks to know. And any budgetary. I know you probably say no, but is there any budgetary implications of that, anything that we can do as we go through our budget process? Because I certainly. That's a high priority for me. I mean, if we need to acquire land to create a parking lot for commercial vehicles, you know, one in the south, one in the central, one in the north, because I know my residents aren't going to be driving down to Akakeak to park their vehicle overnight. That's right. So, you know, we need to have them somewhat accessible as well. So any, any. Do you have the budget for this? Do you, do you know, are there anyway. Well, we can circle back as we continue to flesh out the details and work closely with your team. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, councilmember Olson. Council member Moriata. Yes. You made me think about understanding the difference between the municipalities and the county because I have four municipalities. So I'm always trying to figure out, okay, does it vary from municipality to municipality or do all the municipalities handle that themselves or do they rely on the county? Yeah. So for the most part, the municipalities handle their own. Okay. If it's incorporated, then we don't. We only focus on the county. Got it. Got it. And then for the commercial vehicles, is it all commercial vehicles or based on size or type? What do you mean? Like, for example, if you work for Comcast, you have a regular truck, but it's branded Comcast. Right. Because all of their installation people have cars, but technically it's a commercial vehicle. Or like, is it based on the size of it where it. It's not allowed on to be parked? Commercial vehicles? I think it's an actual definition. And it's defined by, I think, 26,000 pounds. Yes. So the size. Got it. Perfect. Because I think that's sometimes an issue with constituents. They believe, like, oh, it's a commercial vehicle, but technically that's not like, against the law for them to have that type of vehicle. That's right. That's exactly right. Follow up question. I'm so sorry. I'm getting some real time updates from my staff. So apparently one of these boats, not the boat I referenced to you, but another boat, has been in the system in 311 and it's been over a year that it's been sitting there. So that is something that, you know, maybe we can talk after the meeting, but I know where this one is as well. And then is it true that in order for a vehicle to be considered abandoned, it has to have at least two flat tires? Because that's apparently what we've been hearing. It has to be in operable. Okay. No. Okay. It has to be inoperable, dismantled wreck and can't move for more than 100ft. So if you get in and try to drive it. It can't go more than 100ft if you get in and try to drive it according to the law. So what we do, we, I think what you're probably hearing is grace being given. So if you happen to have a flat tire in the car that is properly registered parked in front of your home, we may not issue a citation to that. What we'll do is probably warning it and wait the 72 hours. If the vehicle is not moving. And it would probably fall under a different code, county code, that we would be citing for violation.

But generally, if it's wrecked, it's mantle rusted, it's been sitting there to the point where birds nesting, things of that nature, those are the ones we tend to try to give citations to if it just has one flat tire, but otherwise, it's properly registered. Tags are not expired things of that nature. We tend not to try to penalize citizens form, you know, the flat tire card. Okay. I mean, so I'm not sure if your people who are going out, you know, in the field are following the same what you're saying. I'm not sure because it sounds like we're getting conflicting information. So abandoned means, again, dismantled or unregistered. It has to be generally, and those are the majority of the 311s that we receive. It's not just the vehicle sitting there for any extended period of time. It is that it's unregistered. No one's renewed the tags on it. No one's driving it. So it's considered abandoned because it's just not moving and inoperable. And it's inoperable because it doesn't have registered tags. So do you understand if you haven't registered your plate, you can't drive the vehicle? But again, a flat tire. We do not. If the vehicle is properly registered, we try not to penalize citizens for having a flat tire on there. But if that goes on for four months now, if again, if the vehicle doesn't move and then we're going out noticing that the vehicle hasn't moved, then if we deem it inoperable and would issue the appropriate warrants and warnings for it. Okay. I mean, yeah, I mean, these are obviously critical quality of life issues in our neighborhoods, and we hear about them routinely. We want to work with you to solve these problems. We want to get these cars off our streets. I mean, people clearly are not paying attention to their vehicles when they're out there and not operable, you know, not operable, whatever. Operable. You know, I hear your definition, but they apparently are being given tickets. But at what point do the tickets, you know, turn into towing them and getting them out of there? You know, if you get five tickets or three tickets or, and it's been months, county code is two citations, that must be 90 days or more. So, you know, you're three months out before we actually, they're impound eligible and it's two or more citations. Okay. And then when there is impound eligible we could tell that. Do we automatically report that to whoever would tow them? The booting unit would receive that information and go back out and try to do toes. Now, it's not specific because the county. The county's fast. So we're doing this, you know, at a basis of trying to do patrols through the council management districts to find violations, report back to ones that we have outstanding things that are nature. Yeah, yeah. These are some of the biggest things I hear from my residents and, you know, want to work with you to resolve these. No, I mean, we are sensitive to this. I would like to. If you have, like, the case number from 311, we have them all over. You can share that with us. Thank you. Because we do want to look into that. I will ask for those case numbers to be pulled right now. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you so much. I just have two quick questions in regards to the weight class for the parking lot, the CVP, would that include 18 wheelers? It does. It does include. Okay. Because that's an issue for, in my district along 301, it's a big problem for these 18 wheelers parked along, especially at the wawa. So that's a big concern. But, you know, it's a two way thing. So I want to make sure that, you know, they have a safe place to go and I know we need our trucks. So nothing against them. They have to find a place to sleep, you know, but it would be great to find a safe area for them. So I'm very happy to hear about the CVP and look forward to hearing more. And what's your timeline look like? What are you thinking? I don't want to say. I know you haven't, but what we'll do, I promise, is that we'll come back. We'll come back and make sure that you guys have all the details because it's important, just that the word gets out and everyone needs to know about it. So we'll make sure to continuously update you all. That would be great. So, you know, maybe give you a few. Couple of months to come back. Okay. All right. Thank you. Because that, like I said, that's a huge concern for my area as well. And the last question is about how many pictures or citations do you get for the school bus stop arm camera? About every month or so. Don't know offhand. Just wondering because, I mean, that's a huge issue. I mean, that's a big problem and big concern. And I just wonder, like, how many repeat offenders, because I'm guessing, you know, if that school bus is there, then pretty much is from that neighborhood, you know, people passing it, and if the fine needs to be more, because $250 is a lot, but I feel like if it was more, then people may think twice about doing that.

So thank you. All right, last but certainly not least, we have our office of Management budget, non departmental director Stanley early. Madam chair. Yes. One additional clarification for you and your colleagues. In addition to the on report, there is also a report for non departmental, and Mister Stover, I believe, will provide information about both of those reports at one time. Perfect. Yes, I do have that. Both of those together. So, Mister Stover, I'll turn it over to you so we can get started. Thank you, madam chair. And I know we've been here for a while, so I will try to keep this as brief as possible. To start off, I want to start with the budget for the office of Management and Budget. If I could get in front of me, this is not d. That report begins on page 102 of the virtual binder. Yep. Where. Sorry about that. That's funny. Sorry. I got my papers a little bit disorganized here. Madam chair. Here we go. The Office of Management and Budget. So the request for the Office of Management and Budget is $4.1 million, which is a decrease of $102,000, or about 2.4% below the FY 2024 approved budget. When we go to staffing changes and compensation, the FY 2025 compensation is proposed at almost $3 million, which is about a $50,000 increase, or 1.6%. There are no changes in staffing, so we have full time 29 staff and limited term. There are two staff members. As of March 2024, the office had reported that they had five vacancies, with three of those being for full time positions. As far as attrition rate, they have attrition rate of 4%, with one staff member leaving the office in FY 24. So far with operating expenses, the budget is proposed at $584,000, or a decrease of $11,500. Some of the major, what the. The most major line item in this operating budget is office automation to align with the cost that the office of it has given them, and that's for $517,200. The operating expenses exceed FY 2024 amounts in two of the line items while there are decreases shown in six of the other line items, the increases are $6,000 in printing due to increase of use and a $200 increase in membership fees to align with expected costs. Finally, recoveries have totaled three or are expected to total $368,900, which is a $162,000 increase from last year. The agency continues to run important programs like the county staff program where they used to track progress on a number of different county priorities, and you can also take a look at some of the ways that they have been using fund balance so far. Now I want to move on to the non departmental budget and the FY 2025. Proposed budget for non departmental is $399,000,399.7 million and this is an increase of about $13.7 million or 3.5% increase. The debt service is proposed at 9.8 million and you can see on page two the. Or, sorry. You can see the expenditures by category on page two and you can have. You can see more information about the debt service on page two as well. The debt service is proposed at $184 million for FY 2025, which is an increase of $9.8 million, or 5.6%. The county is planning to issue new obligations for 230 million in FY 2025 and this is to fund the construction of schools and other county buildings in 2024. The bond is expected to happen this month in May at a level not exceeding $195.8 million. There are a number of charges, surcharges that the county has that help offset some of these debt costs and can help pay for some of the costs for the CIP. And the first of those is the school facilities charge. The revenues for those were 47 million in 2023, but they are estimated to drop significantly for 2024. And that is simply because this year people are not issuing as many permits. I mean, they're not getting as many permits to make changes on their home or they're not buying homes and so or property. And the result is that there's been a decline in the revenue that this gets. That is expected once interest rates start going down, that is expected to start rising back up again. Expenditures in FY 2023 were around 50 million, but have slightly decreased in FY 2024 to 46 million. The next surcharge is the adequate public safety and public safety facilities charge, and the revenues for this were 15.3 million in 2023 and they're expected to increase to 7.517.7 million in FY 2024, but fall a bit and go back down to 12 million in 2025. The expenditures in FY 23 equal around 9 million, and they're expected to decrease to 5.6 million in FY 24, but then increase just a little bit more to 5.7 million FY 2025. And you can see, for both the school surcharge and the public safety surcharge, you can see the revenues and expenditure tables that we have included there. The next thing that I wanted to mention, and I know Vice chair Harrison has already brought this up in questions previously, but right now the county has a policy of making sure that ", "esg_v1":

And you can see, for both the school surcharge and the public safety surcharge, you can see the revenues and expenditure tables that we have included there. The next thing that I wanted to mention, and I know Vice chair Harrison has already brought this up in questions previously, but right now the county has a policy of making sure that debt service does not exceed 8% of county sourced revenues, and the county has been able to stay within that policy. But there are concerns that the county could possibly exceed that 8% starting FY 2027 to FY 2029. The Office of Management Budget has expressed that they are doing everything they can to make sure that they stay below this level. There are a number of assumptions made in coming to this calculation that could be off and could result in the debt service coverage percentage being lower than what is presented here. But right now, that is what the expectation is. I asked if there was any expectation if going below this, going above this level, would result in any change to the bond rating, and the feeling was that it shouldn't have a dramatic impact on the bottom rating, hopefully still keep that triple a bond rating. And what the office expressed was that the more important part was maintaining adequate reserves, which the county has done a good job of doing. You can see on page five the fund balance. The county continues to maintain a fund balance of 5% that's mandated by the charter. And as they also have an additional 3%, which will turn into 4% for FY 2025, that they're required to set aside as well. The FY 2024 fund balance is expected to be 14.3% of the general fund budget, and in 2025 should be 13.5%. The next item in non departmental are grants and payments. And this is where some of the decreases that you see in this budget really are. The grants and transfers payments totals 42.4 million, and that's a decrease of around almost 6 million from the FY 2024 budget. And going on to page six, you can kind of see a breakdown of what that is. By far the element, the line item that has the biggest decrease is the grants and to community organizations payments. And there, there is a proposed amount of 4.95 million, which is a decrease of around 5 million or 50%. And in asking about this decrease, the office expressed that this really was made in response to a lot of the fiscal pressures that the county is facing and the need to pass a balanced budget. Grants to community organizations was determined as an area of the budget that could be cut to allow funding for important county services, and representatives from OMB maintain that decreasing the budget reduction would ultimately end up requiring a budget reduction in some other area of county services. You can see a list of the county executives grants if you look at attachment, one of the first round responses for non departmental the designation grants. Non departmental designation grants were also cut by 50% or 2.6 million while special appropriation grants were eliminated, and you can see the breakdown of that grants to community organizations in page seven. Another thing to point out is strategic goal initiatives funding supports various strategic goal funding, which supports various initiatives is proposed at $500,000, which is a decrease of funding of $1 million. Finally, with grants, transfers to other funds is proposed at $1.4 million. As we've talked about previously, 400,000 of those dollars are going towards the fair election fund as proposed, while a million of those dollars will be transferred to the local business bond fund. When it comes to operational expenditures, the proposed level is 162 million, or about 2 million above the FY 24 level. This increase is really due to the cost of leases and utilities that is offset by equipment leases and miscellaneous expenses. And so you can see the breakdown on page nine of operational costs. Proposed expenditures for equipment leases are 23 million, which is a decrease of 3.7 million in the budget. Another thing to point out is that the FY 2025 proposed level for other leases is 39.2 million, which is an increase of 8.6 million or 28.2%. And you can see a breakdown of those costs and attachment six to the first round responses. And then finally, I want to move on to contingencies and economic development funds. So contingencies you can see that they are proposed at 10.7 million to support potential countywide salary adjustments, depending on the negotiations that happen there. When it comes to the economic Development Fund, the expenditures are proposed for 9 million, which is consistent with last year FY 2024 approved budgets, and you can see the fund balance for that fund on the next page. The final element of this budget is grants funds and the proposed grant budget remains unchanged from last year. It reflects funding received from the state and federal governments. To address the Covid-19 pandemic in FY 2024, the county is estimated to spend almost $27 million in grant funding received from various federal and state programs, and that is it on OMB and non departmental concludes my report. Thank you. Thank you. And now, for real, you mister early, and maybe you have a comment this time. And please introduce your team. Thank you. Thank you so much. That's what I really wanted to do.

Thank you. Thank you. And now, for real, you mister early, and maybe you have a comment this time. And please introduce your team. Thank you. Thank you so much. That's what I really wanted to do. First of all, I think you hear from a lot of us from time to time. So, Amber Hendricks, the deputy director. Amber, do you want to say anything? Amber is critical to so many functions, and I guess many of you work with her regularly. And Brent Johnson is the operating budget officer for the county. And Brent is really responsible for coordinating an awful lot of the preparation of all of this operating budget with many people reporting through him. Bryant Halloran is the capital budget officer who is obviously critical to all those functions. And this has been his first year with us, and it's been just wonderful to have him here. And then Deanna Maker Mims is the grants manager, who. So all of the ARPA, she's the ARPA leader, but she's also responsible for making sure that all of the grants issues across different. All the way across the organization from the OMB side are handled. And in addition, has some departments to deal with. And Mary proctor Swan is our. Is a senior analyst who deals with non departmental. David Chupe is not here. He's the other senior manager. And he is responsible for both the revenue side and for the. And for our. Also, his is in Annapolis most of the time. He's also on the legislative side and is responsible for the tax differential program. So that's our core folks. And I do want to mention that. And then I do want to say one more thing about OMB before, and then I'll ask if there are questions about that. And then we'll go to non departmental. There are just a few things that we do that, that people may not be aware. So I just wanted to mention one. I think what was mentioned, the county is part of OMB. Now. The county staff director is part of the executive office, but the analysts that staff it, the three analysts that staff it are part of OMB. We also, this year, for the first year, there are seven departments where we are the departmental budget person, soil conservation, board of license commissioners, police accountability board, administrative, charging, human rights, ethics and accountability, and the personnel board. We are. We handle both sides of that. And then, as I mentioned, we do serve in Annapolis also. So we have that element. So let me shut up. And if there are other questions about OMB, we'll come back to non departmental, because I know people are going to have questions about that. Anyone want to ask. All right, Mister vice chair. Questions? No questions. Councilmember Oriatha. I'll just take this off to say it is a pleasure working with you, Stanley. I have no questions. You always answer all my questions, so I appreciate you. All right, madam chair, I defer to you. No questions. Councilmember Olson. Wow, I'm good, too. Now we can direct early. Now let me put the light on you. Spotlight. Now we're into the hard part, so let me, I'm trying to be brief, but I also want, I'm going to hit the three or four points that I'm imagining that people are thinking about. Start with debt service. So we are preparing to do our next set of bonds. As was mentioned, we will be making presentations to the rating agencies May 7, May 22, May 23. So at the same time that we're, I think the same day the budget is finalized or the target for budget finalization is the same day, we're still going to be. We're going to be. So we were trying to work out the two places at once thing at the moment, and Amber has been neck deep in that whole process. And so that that's going ahead, you'll find in non departmental, and you kind of touched on it when we were talking about finance. You'll find a schedule of how much money we expect to spend. Now, that number for 25 is, that's 24. I believe the number for 25 is 184 million. That's a mostly known number. That could move a little bit because of what happens when the actual sale occurs. There's something called bond premium that can affect that. So it could move a couple million dollars, but for the most part, that's a known set of numbers. The last couple million is an estimated, and we also. So that's a big piece of the number, and that's where the big increase in non departmental is. Now, I want to talk a little bit about grants because I have a feeling there might be some concern about that. So here's the. We have a, when we put together the budget, as we've talked about, we are looking at less money overall than for next year, than this year, and we are looking at having some salary increases. Now. We have those that are built in from prior agreements that say, you know, you're going to have a, you know, we've already got a union agreement that's in effect for this year that has to be figured into the increase, has to be figured in for next year. So by the time we do that, we're starting out. That's why we started out, I think we talked about, we started out $170 million and we brought that down. And one of the things we did is we said in terms of grants from the council and the administration, we took those down by 50%.

And one of the things we did is we said in terms of grants from the council and the administration, we took those down by 50%. And I realize that's going to be controversial, but both, and in regard to the county executives, in the past, the county executive had about a million and a half dollars. That was things like the women's luncheon and various events for communities and so forth. That's coming down by two thirds. So there is a, so those are, I know those are hard. That's why those numbers are so harsh, to be perfectly honest. And when we, when we look at our, now when we look at the, under the area that we call, when we look at what we're doing with our operating money, we've got this, this section where we have operating expenditures. And one of the things that are in, those are, all of those, not only are leases for various items, but also what we call cops, which are certificates of participation and things like them, which is how we buy our vehicles. And those are a schedule also. Now we, again, the last million or so of that, we will, we don't know for sure, but all the rest of that is pretty much a schedule. Now, of course, things like electricity and all that, those are simply all of our utilities. We have, you know, we're proposing $21 million in utilities. We've been working with OCS to try to make, to get a good number. We think that that's an estimate, but it actually assumes we're going to be able to bring that down slightly from what we're going to spend this year. So it is very, very tight. So we have a lot of those, I don't want to run through all of them. One of the questions that was raised and one of the earlier discussions was, what about risk management in OPEB? Well, when we talk about the OPEB numbers, you see there's a $44 million number which is carried forward from this year. That number the last couple years we've increased. The last couple years we've increased it because we weren't putting enough in, but now I think we've put enough in. So it's not getting worse. But we still have a liability to resolve. In regard to risk management, we have increased, it doesn't show up in any of, on a single line, but it shows up in all of our paychecks. It shows up in every department. We have increased the amount of money that we are deducting to put in for workers comp, because that really is the driver of that. Yes, we have, you know, we lose lawsuits and all that kind of stuff, and we have put in money to cover those things. But the real driver is workers comp cost, and that's now I think we've stabilized the problem, but we have not pushed it down yet. The next task is pushing it down. This is not the year to do that. But we have stabilized the problem. And then finally, finally, I just wanted, I will just say we do have, we are in the process of negotiations. That's reflected here. We will probably have to make other adjustments. I can speak to that. More than that. Okay. Thank you, mister early. Vice chair Harrison. Thank you, madam chair. Mister early. I'm not going to get into the finite numbers, but one of the statements that you just said is that we're going to have less next year. Budget realities of what we're dealing with this year. Let me, let me, let me make sure I was clear. What I was saying was in FY 25, well, the year coming that we're working on now, we'll have less money than we have in Fy 24. Okay. That's what I mean. So from, and I know we're talking about FY 25, but I want to talk about, I mean, we had no clue that we were going to lose about 100 million less than transferring record agents from one year to the other just for the future. How do you see that playing out? Do you still see a decree? Do you think there will be more of a decrease in that area or do you think we will rebound and flatten out from that? I think we have flattened and I think we will rebound at some point unless we can, unless we are able to. When you tell me or when the Fed tells me what the interest rates will be, we will be able to make a better prediction. But I think realistically we should expect to have some, that 26 is likely to be somewhat better than 25, but not radically better. Okay. All right. All right. Well, that's all my question. I didn't want to go too deep into it. Yeah. Thank you. Lean Thompson, councilmember Oriaba, did you have questions? Thank you. Thank you for sending the updated arpolis.

So, for example, it skips from environment down to no, excuse me, I'll never mind see it. Okay, so that's my mistake. Okay, so I'll look through that. And if I have questions, if I could reach to you out offline about some of the funding there and. Okay. And then a question about one of the set asides. There was a crisis.

Oh, I'm sorry, under miscellaneous for the. Oh, no worries here again, community crisis. All right there. Community Crisis Services, Inc. I'm just curious, like what that is.

If that was like just a contract, but we're working with someone else and I could just send you it offline and I'm just curious. We're trying to find it. That's okay. So I'll send you the attachment and I'll highlight it. And again, it wasn't funded in 2024, but I'm just curious of what it would have been. A million dollar change in 2023 to 2024. And it's also not funded in 2025, but maybe it's a one off contract, but I'll send it to you offline. Okay. Well, yeah, I just am not sure. We'll be happy to provide the information. Okay. Thank you, council chair Ivey. Thank you. I would like to know what would be the impact financially to the county if we lost our triple A bond rating. I don't know, but what I will say is this. It would materially increase our rates, I would say so, let's say, and it would depend on where the market's at. But let's say we lose 20 basis points, which is two tenths of a percent. And if you did that off of we offer, we'll put out a couple hundred million dollars a year. A couple hundred million dollars a year would be. That would be about 400,000. It'd be over 30 years. So that would cost us $12 million on what we would do each year over the life of them. Those would accumulate over time. So it's the kind of thing that. And then of course, there are probably some things that would have to be renegotiated. It would affect then our cop financing that would roll through there. It could affect other items like, you know, whether that are not directly us. Like for example, the fact that we have a AAA makes it easier for Wamada to keep their AAA. It makes it easier for, I'm sorry, WSSC to keep their AAA. So it would, you know, so I would say it's safe to say it would be a. It would gradually accumulate and get worse over time and each issuance would be more expensive. And how big would be, it depends on how. How big a deal, how big the interest spread in the market is. And I think 20 basis points is a reasonable first guess. I'm sorry, that's a little bit of. That was a little. Yeah. You know, I guess suffice it to say is we don't want to go down that road. We do not want to go that road. I would also say there's another thing. Okay. There are a lot of advantages that we have for being AAAA that aren't directly cash. There are companies that consider that there are agreements that we can get. There are deals that we are able to do in terms of terms of just getting bank arrangements where if we didn't have a AAA, we have to have some outside insurance. It just changes a lot of stuff. Makes it harder. Yeah. Okay. And you said that what, what do we need to do? Like, this budget we assume will be okay when you have these meetings coming up? I hope so. Let me say this. I think I am optimistic, but it's going to be, we need to put our best foot forward. We won't have. I guess it's just we pass the budget. When you finish with these meetings, when do they make their declaration? One will probably. Fitch will probably do it within probably, you know, I don't know, around somewhere between the 15th and 20th, before the 24th. The other two probably about the end of maybe, you know. So they'll probably do about the end of May. They'll be after the budget. Probably the first one will be before the 24 May. They have to do it by their rules by that date. Okay. Thank you. Council member Olson, did you have any questions? Did you want to follow up? Yeah. Okay. Mister Harrison, real fast, since we're on that topic of AAA bond rating. When we went last year, were there certain requirements that they required of our county to show confidence when we were to return the following year that they were looking for or are we on some sort of condition right now when it comes? So the only thing we did get one thing, and that was they felt we were using too much, that the use of reserves in this budget year was unacceptably high. It was okay that we did it this time, but it was sort of like, don't do that again. The other thing that Fitch is also the one that has changed its definition.

We will first have 30 minutes for the applicant. Good morning. Can you hear me? Thank you very much. Good morning Madam chair members of the council, Thomas Hallerin. I'm an attorney with offices here in Largo and I'm here representing the owner of the University Place shopping center. I have with me today Mister Bob Beagleman who is a part of the ownership group. He has been one of the owners of this center since 1986, approximately 40 years. He knows the property better than anybody and has been intimately involved in the day to day operations of the center throughout that time. As staff has noted, there are two applications that are before the council today. One is a departure from the number of parking and loading spaces provided at the center and the other is a departure from the design standards to allow the standard size spaces to be reconfigured at nine by 18ft rather than nine and a half by 19ft. The impetus for this application was the taking of a little bit over 10,000 property frontage by the Maryland Department of Transportation for the construction of the purple Line. Anybody that's driven by there recently knows that that construction is in full phase right now. The front of the property is covered with pipes and 15th Avenue is completely impassable at this point in time as the roadway improvements are being constructed. The impact of the taking by state highway administration was the loss of about 40 of the 125 parking spaces that were on site. And not only did they take those 40 spaces, but the spaces that are left are not easy to get into or can't be accessed because of the changes to the front of the property. So the property owner filed these two applications to allow them to reconfigure the parking lot and recoup as many of the lost parking spaces as they could. As the planning board resolution notes, prior to the taking by state highway administration, there were 125 parking spaces provided and 124 required. After the taking by state highway administration is about 40 spaces lost or about 85 parking spaces. Through the reconfiguration of the parking lot, they will be able to recoup about 22 spaces, giving them a total of 107, which leaves them 17 spaces short of the required parking in the prior CSC zone. And Mister Beagleman could tell you that before the taking with the 124 spaces, they never had a parking issue. They always had excess parking, in part due to the fact that this property was previously well served by bus service, was also frequented by pedestrians on a regular basis, and so they never had an issue with parking. However, the reduction of down to 85 has become a problem and so they do need to recoup some of those spaces. The construction of the purple line will also add additional mass transit services to the property. I would note that the along University Boulevard, the Purple Line stations will be placed in the median of the roadway, so the frontage of the property, while it's being pushed back by 40ft will not change. There's one access. Currently or previously. Before the taking, there was one access to University Boulevard, one access to 15th Avenue, and that will remain after the construction by state highway administration of the Purple Line. The construction of the the reconfiguration of the parking lot is intended to provide adequate driveway aisles so people can get in and out of the shopping center safely and conveniently. And that's really the reason for the departure from design standards. As I noted, the standard size space is 19ft deep and we want to maintain aisle widths that are a minimum of 22 to 23ft in depth. The code requirement is 22, and so by providing 19 foot spaces, it would reduce the driveway aisle width, which would either require a departure or we would have substandard aisle width. And so for purposes of making sure that we have safe on site circulation, we've requested a reduction in the. In the depth of the parking spaces. I did note in our justification statement that under the new zoning ordinance, the standard size parking space i", "esg_v1": [{"name": "University Place Shopping Center", "insights": [{"observation": "The construction of the Purple Line has resulted in the loss of parking spaces and has made 15th Avenue impassable due to roadway improvements.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The property is almost entirely impervious with topography sloping to the south and east.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The reconfiguration of the parking lot will regain 22 of the 40 spaces lost due to the taking of land for the construction of the Purple Line.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The front of the property is covered with pipes, and access to University Boulevard and 15th Avenue remains unchanged.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The construction of the Purple Line will add additional mass transit services.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The reconfigured parking lot aims to provide adequate driveway aisles for safe and convenient access.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "University Place Shopping Center", "insights": [{"observation": "The construction of the Purple Line has resulted in the loss of parking spaces and has made 15th Avenue impassable due to roadway improvements.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The property is almost entirely impervious with topography sloping to the south and east.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The reconfiguration of the parking lot will regain 22 of the 40 spaces lost due to the taking of land for the construction of the Purple Line.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The front of the property is covered with pipes, and access to University Boulevard and 15th Avenue remains unchanged.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The construction of the Purple Line will add additional mass transit services.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The reconfigured parking lot aims to provide adequate driveway aisles for safe and convenient access.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 361860, "chunk_end_time": 785256, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3562?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3562?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=361"}, {"start": 9000, "end": 15000, "text": "here was one access to University Boulevard, one access to 15th Avenue, and that will remain after the construction by state highway administration of the Purple Line.

I did note in our justification statement that under the new zoning ordinance, the standard size parking space is nine by 18, which is what we are proposing here. And that's also a standard that's been adopted pretty regionally by a lot of jurisdictions, including Montgomery county. So nine by 18 is by no means a substandard sized space, but it does provide that extra flexibility to make sure that we have adequate circulation within the parking lot. And then the final thing that I would like to note is included in our justification statement. It just so happens that in 2021, Maryland National Capital park and Planning Commission did a study parking needs in this Tacoma Langley park area, and they concluded that the commercial businesses in that area were adequately parked. If you look at any aerial photograph of this area, you'll see large parking lots serving the existing commercial uses. One of the concerns expressed by the owners at that time was with the knowledge that the purple line was coming, what impact that would have on the parking and their need to reconfigure their parking lots. Well, and that's exactly what Mister Beagleman is doing through this application. Finally, I would like to note that many times people think that when the state hobby administration condemns part of your property that you're not responsible for the end result. But that's not the case. The mere fact that the state acquired that property and resulted in this reduction in the parking lot size, it's his responsibility to fix it. If it drops his parking below the the mandatory requirement, he's got either find a way to create more parking or obtain a waiver, which is what we're doing today. So the approval of the waiver will allow the shopping center to continue to operate with adequate parking that is safely accessible and will also result in an improvement of the shopping center. The entire parking lot will be repaved as part of this reconfiguration, and new lighting will be installed as well. The parking lot in the front of the property will be upgraded. State highway administration is reinstalling sidewalks along the front of the property as part of their work. And a new landscape strip will be included as well as part of all that work. So at the end of the day, the shopping center will function appropriately and will have adequate parking to meet the needs of its tenants and will also be upgraded in terms of its view from the road. I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have. Mister Beagleman is here also to answer any questions about the operation of the shopping center. Thank you for your time. Thank you. I don't know if there are any. Do you have questions? Go ahead. Councilmember. Thank you Mister Holler, it's always good to see you. And this is one of my first parking things in my district. So thanks for being here and explaining some stuff. I do have some questions and again, I'm new, so maybe if you could just enlighten me with this waiver and down to fewer spots here. You know, something that really concerns me in my university boulevard corridor is the amount of like work trucks and kind of bigger cars are just very much the norm, as you all would know. In your shopping center. Do you feel like it's going to be adequate? I don't want to see. You know, I have concerns about people having accidents and sort of just the congestion with that, and they're pretty large vehicles that I've definitely witnessed myself at that property and throughout the corridor. So if you could speak to that and if you feel like the size reduction will be you'll be okay with that? Yes, that's a great question. One of the things we looked at in terms of what we could do to reconfigure the shopping center. So, for example, one way that you can try to acquire, gain more parking is to maximize the number of compact car spaces that are allowed, which are eight by 16 and a half. But we didn't want to do that. We had some compact car spaces in the shopping center before, and we wanted, and we retained most of those. But we could have increased the number of compact car spaces, but that would have done exactly what you said. It would have constrained the full size parking spaces. So we kept the number of compact car spaces lower than what is allowed in the code, and instead went with the standard size parking space of nine by 18. And as I mentioned, that is the standard in the new code. That is the standard in Montgomery county. That's the standard regionally for parking. And those base sizes are adequate for the larger vehicles that you're referring to. And that's also why we requested the waiver to allow for the depth of the space to be modified, because we wanted to make sure that as cars back in and out, that we didn't compromise the room, that they had to be able to back in and out of those spaces. So standard size aisle widths in Prince George's county are 22ft, and our aisle widths are a minimum of 22ft. In some cases more than that, to allow cars to safely be able to get in and out of the parking spaces. And it was exactly for that purpo", "esg_v1": [{"name": "State Highway Administration", "insights": [{"observation": "Construction of the Purple Line by State Highway Administration is impacting the parking configuration.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"observation": "State Highway Administration is reinstalling sidewalks along the front of the property.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Mister Beagleman (Shopping Center Owner)", "insights": [{"observation": "Reconfiguration of the parking lot is intended to provide adequate driveway aisles so people can get in and out of the shopping center safely and conveniently, even if it means deviating from standard design sizes.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Parking lot repaving and new lighting will be installed as part of the reconfiguration.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The front of the parking lot property will be upgraded and a new landscape strip will be included.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The waiver reduction in parking spots raises concerns about big work trucks and congestion leading potentially to accidents.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Maintaining standard size parking spaces instead of increasing compact spaces to ensure safety for larger vehicles.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "State Highway Administration", "insights": [{"observation": "Construction of the Purple Line by State Highway Administration is impacting the parking configuration.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"observation": "State Highway Administration is reinstalling sidewalks along the front of the property.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Mister Beagleman (Shopping Center Owner)", "insights": [{"observation": "Reconfiguration of the parking lot is intended to provide adequate driveway aisles so people can get in and out of the shopping center safely and conveniently, even if it means deviating from standard design sizes.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Parking lot repaving and new lighting will be installed as part of the reconfiguration.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The front of the parking lot property will be upgraded and a new landscape strip will be included.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The waiver reduction in parking spots raises concerns about big work trucks and congestion leading potentially to accidents.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Maintaining standard size parking spaces instead of increasing compact spaces to ensure safety for larger vehicles.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 720610, "chunk_end_time": 1076218, "base_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3562?view_id=2&redirect=true", "chunk_url": "https://princegeorgescountymd.granicus.com/player/clip/3562?view_id=2&redirect=true&entrytime=720"}, {"start": 14000, "end": 20000, "text": "t car spaces, but that would have done exactly what you said.

In some cases more than that, to allow cars to safely be able to get in and out of the parking spaces. And it was exactly for that purpose, because we knew we needed to maintain a larger number of spaces that could accommodate larger vehicles. Mountain chair can ask you a follow up. Okay. And then when for the whole property, if you could just repeat it would be down to just 85. No, the take, the taking over that number. So we had 125 before the taking. The taking took out 40, so that took us down to 85. By reconfiguring the parking lot, as we're proposing in this application, we will get back to 107 parking spaces, and which will reclaim 22 of the spaces. So the number required is 124. We'll have 107. So we're requesting a departure for 17 parking spaces. And did you ever consider a departure for even less parking spots to provide fewer parking spots? Yes. What I would say to that is, as the area is urban, we want people out of their cars. It's very congested. We want people walking. And as I mentioned, you know, Mister Beagleman will tell you that with 125 spaces, he never had an issue. He always had extra parking spaces with 85. Well, it's not even fair to use the 85 because state Hive administration has pipes all over his front of his property. But from his perspective at 85, that's just. He's really nervous about not having enough parking for his tenants. Because one of the problems if the state highway takes your parking and then you want to try to release to one of the restaurants on site and say I don't have enough parking, I'm not going to release. We don't want to lose tenants. So what I would say to you is that the number of parking spaces he's proposing, while it's 17 less than what he had before, he's very confident that that will be enough. But he's not so confident that he wants to lose more parking spaces. Thank you. Thank you. Does anyone else have a question? And it's glad. I'm glad to see you back, Mister Dunoga. And I don't believe there's any opposition. I don't have anyone listed. Okay, we will go to Stan Brown now. Good morning. Yes, the applicant has made a very reasonable request in response to the state highway administration's eminent domain taking of the acreage. And I would concur wholeheartedly with the planning board's recommendation of approval in both cases. Okay, I will now turn to council member Fisher for direction. Yes, I will take this under advisement. Thank you. Or motion. Take it under advisement. Okay. What is our last date? You have to have action by date of June 7. Okay, that's where we are on that one. And I assume you are the same. Would you like to make a motion on dpls 220 zero seven? Yes, madam chair, I just motion to take that under advisement and I will be done by June 7.
