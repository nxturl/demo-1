We're gonna move right on to section number five. Next up are reports to the planning commission from council member Dish. Good evening, everyone. So the budget passed last night, and it contains an additional FTE for planning to hire a permit coordinator, which will be helpful for smaller developers. We've been asking for this. We leveled up the third of the three. Level one had the third of the three positions that had been approved. At level one, it's leveled up to five. So that should give you a little bit more capacity. There were a lot of other things we did, but those were two things that matter to you. And then we also approved the r 1D rezoning for Riverside. Yes. Yes. Okay. And I don't think that there was. I mean, there's lots in that budget. It's a beautiful budget. And we also threw you a little bit of dough to hire a consultant to start doing some of those. Remember the four lines that could be 20 for the economic development? We threw in some money for a consultant. So, yeah, steaming ahead. Thank you. Planning manager. Mugs. Kelly. I was waiting for permission. Oh, you sure? Thank you very much for the budget amendments. We truly appreciate that. In addition to the 1.5 Fte that will be coming our way to augment our staff and boost our capacity, we will also have a dedicated vehicle for site inspections. This is going to really help our team. And I am reminding you on behalf of manager Lennart, that next Tuesday evening, from seven to nine, the comp plan subcommittee will be held. You should have a calendar hold for that. Noting, as I did during the roll call, that commissioner Clark has submitted a formal resignation. And manager Lennart and I will be looking at our pool of submissions for the planning commission and hoping to advance some new names to the administrator's office and city council when we have a chance to see who we have available. It was shared over email. Just a quick pulse check. Who would be available for your July meeting? And now, with Commissioner Clark's resignation and the folks who will be out of town, we are recommending that you cancel your July meeting. So look for a, a motion and a line item for that on your 1st June agenda. Last but not least, from the manager report, I would like to introduce new planning services intern, Cecile Landre Hernandez, who is here with us this evening. Cecile, why don't you turn on your microphone and give a quick introduction? Thanks, Cecilia. Okay. Hi, everybody, and thank you so much for having me. And thank you for that introduction. So, yeah, I'm the new planning services intern. Hi, my name is Cecile and I'm a senior at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, studying civil engineering and environmental policy.

And is there anyone present that would like to speak at this time? Mister Garber? Thank you, Chair Lee. It's nice to be with commission tonight. I'm Ken Garberg, 28, Haverhill court is now the appropriate time to talk about 601 Mary court. There's no public hearing for that pre pud, right? That's technically correct because the pre Pud conference is not, does not have a public comment. That is true. However, I think this first opportunities for issues that are not listed. Not listed as a public hearing. Okay, I think you're good. So I can go ahead? Yes. I mean, I don't have much to say because I haven't seen the presentation. I've just looked at a few of the application. But as you know, any pud must demonstrate public benefit, and I'm sure you'll be asking a lot about this. I'm not seeing much benefit in the application besides somewhat higher density. Balance that against the fact that they're taking down four houses that are almost certainly more affordable to their current renters than the new townhomes will be. I'm not seeing any affordable housing in the petition in its absence. What if I could be so bold as to suggest passive house construction? As you know, despite the name, passive house construction isn't passive. It includes active heating and ventilation systems, but with very low energy demand. You probably know the five passive house principles. Thermal insulation, passive house windows, ventilation, heat recovery, air tightness 0.6 ach 50 or better in absence of thermal bridges, these principles should be part of all new construction. The south facing orientation of these particular townhomes would make them perfect for passive house certification. Tim McDonald of Onion Flat told planning Commission in 2022 that passive house buildings don't have to cost more if they're done right and can even be compatible with affordable housing. Utility bills would be minuscule for renters, better indoor air quality, no gas connection, obviously rooftop solar. That could probably provide the necessary electricity most of the time. Given the low energy demand for heating and cooling, this could be a model passive house net zero project, at least for this neighborhood. In fact, net zero should be the standard for all puds and all rezonings. In fact, at this stage, in alignment with the a 20 plan and along the Viridian and south town models. Thank you. Thank you. Do we have anyone else present that would like to speak at this time about an item that is not listed as a public hearing on this agenda? Seeing no one, do we have anybody remotely? We do not have any hands raised. Oh, perfect. Thank you. Which way do I look great. With that, I will close the first public comment and then we'll move on to public hearings. Staff. Thanks, Kelly. For the planning commission meeting on June 4, 2024, there is one item but with two parts, and I can explain after reading so the Washtenaw Avenue and East Stadium Boulevard Transit Corridor District TC one rezoning the Ann Arbor Planning Commission will hold a public hearing to hear all those interested in a proposed rezoning, an amendment to the zoning map section 510.2 of chapter 55 of the Unified Development Code to rezone parcels in the Washtenaw Avenue East Stadium Boulevard area near US 23 to tc one district before making a recommendation to city council, the city of Ann Arbor is considering action to rezone approximately 103 acres, including at least 61 addresses and tax parcels in the Washtenaw Avenue East Stadium Boulevard area. More information is available at plan 802 gov.org. tC one corridors part two of this notice is Pittsfield Village townhouse dwelling district three rezoning the Ann Arbor Planning Commission will hold a public hearing to hear all those interested in a proposed rezoning, which is an amendment to the zoning map. Section 5.10.2 of chapter 55 of the Unified Development Code rezone a portion of a parcel in the Pittsfield village development along Parkwood Avenue, zone c three fringe commercial to r three, before making a recommendation to city council. The proposed r three zoning will match the existing residential use of the parcel. So by way of explanation, there's something more than just tc one rezoning in this public hearing because as we were reviewing all of the parcels carefully in order to properly notice them, that meeting, it came to our attention that there were a number of parcels that had split zoning districts, and we'd like to tidy them at the same time that we're advancing the tc one parcels that are under consideration. Thank you. We're on to section number eight, which is unfinished business, of which we have none, and we're going to be moving on to section nine eight, regular business commissioner Amishman.

So regarding this nine a, I will be recusing myself as I am part of the development team, so let me know when I can come back. Thank you. All right. With that, I'm going to announce 22 70 Platt Road site plan for Planning Commission Action sp 23 0022 Viridianac County Farm south this is a site plan to amend approved Viridianac County Farm south plan file number trackit sp 210 20 by redesigning buildings v as in Viking, KK, l as in lion, M as in Mary, c, c as in cat, d D as in dog and e as in elephant, ee ff increasing the total units from 110 to 121. Building locations generally remain the same, while the types of building proposed and the number of unit buildings per building changes, the Viridianac County Farm south development has 110 approved dwelling units. Proposed is 121 in a single family townhouse and apartment buildings on 363,945 square foot, eight acre site zones Viridian County Farm Pud district. The district is a mixed income, mixed using housing types neighborhood of up to 16 dwellings per acre. And with that, I believe we are moving on to the petitioner presentation. So I believe we have thrive collective Heath har. Actually, we were going. Sorry to interrupt. Oh, sure. The petitioner did not have a presentation at this time. Mister Brokoff is here to answer any questions I do have, and he can probably add anything that I may miss as we're going through this. But I have the screen up here so I can walk you out through the changes. We'll move directly to staff presentation. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Okay, so forgive me, I am going to be reading some of this from my notes from planner DeLeo, who is the main planner on this project. So basically, what's here before you tonight is a revised site plan for the Viridian county farm south. I think everybody's kind of familiar with the site's located, but obviously on Platte Road just west of Huron Parkway there. The site, it's eight acres of the twelve acre total viridian at County Farm Pud. So it's all part of one pud. They're only modifying the southern part of that pud. So. And again, as chair Lee indicated through the it is a mixed housing, sustainable neighborhood and the overall density by the Pud regulations are permitted up to 16 dwelling units per acre. They do not exceed that. So the proposed plan does fit within the PUD zoning regulations here. So this is a project that would be approved tonight by planning commission and would not go forward to city council afterwards. Okay. So getting to some of the details, basically the most important things. The site plan actually had several amendments gone through over the last couple of years. Basically, it was originally approved in 2020 for 99 dwelling units and 16 homes, 42 townhouses, 30 walk up flats, and eleven micro studios. It was amended once in 2022 to increase the number of micro apartments, bringing the total number of dwelling units to 110. This proposed site plan adds eleven more dwelling units for a proposed total of 121. The proposed site plan changes, you can see here up on the screen. They're kind of called out in the bubbled areas there in the black. I will scroll onto a next screen that shows them a little bit more detail. You also have in our staff, in your staff report a very helpful diagram that indicates the proposed site plan changes as far as what the approved layout, the number of units, how it's being changed, whether it's in additional units or less units in those areas, as well as on page three of the staff report, there are again, zoom in details of the site plan changes that are before you tonight. In summary, I will. You can see again, this is focused on the viridian, the south Beauty section. The changes, basically, they're adding new units because the individual garages and buildings, CC and DD, we can't. It's over on this, the right, the right side of the plan here, and eE, FF have been converted into living spaces. So basically existing garages have been converted to living space that allows the driveways that service those to be removed, reducing the overall amount of impervious surface as well as in the previous. I don't have the previous approved plan. There's kind of like a faux street that was in between the parking areas there. So that that street gets to be removed now. And there's, again, kind of in the right, upper right part of the screen or, sorry, of the site plan image here you can see there is additional green space in that area. So there's added pervious surface. Let's see, there's less vehicular use area and more green space. As I covered the details of the building, I think, well, this is a plan that goes a little bit more into the open space plan here. Again, in the kind of the upper right here, the additional open space that surrounds building l, as well as the CCD, EE and FF. This green, well, open space here will be a green area which was again, the previously the garages as well as a circulation drive as part of the site plan. So again", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Viridianac County Farm South", "insights": [{"observation": "The site plan is to amend approved Viridianac County Farm south plan by redesigning buildings and increasing the total units from 110 to 121.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The development is a mixed income, mixed using housing types neighborhood of up to 16 dwellings per acre.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The new units are being added by converting existing garages into living space, reducing the overall amount of impervious surface and adding green space.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There is less vehicular use area and more green space.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "This is a site plan that includes more pervious surfaces and open green spaces, indicating better environmental management.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Viridianac County Farm South", "insights": [{"observation": "The site plan is to amend approved Viridianac County Farm south plan by redesigning buildings and increasing the total units from 110 to 121.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The development is a mixed income, mixed using housing types neighborhood of up to 16 dwellings per acre.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The new units are being added by converting existing garages into living space, reducing the overall amount of impervious surface and adding green space.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There is less vehicular use area and more green space.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "This is a site plan that includes more pervious surfaces and open green spaces, indicating better environmental management.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1041634, "chunk_end_time": 1430916, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXmiuhRW-kE", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXmiuhRW-kE&t=1041s"}, {"start": 14000, "end": 20000, "text": "ace that allows the driveways that service those to be removed, reducing the overall amount of impervious surface as well as in the previous.

So again, although they are only altering a kind of a limited focus of this site plan, the site plan does get reviewed in its entirety. So this site plan has been through all staff review, transportation as well as stormwater and all of our reviewing staff, and they have recommended approval and planning staff is recommending approval of the beauty changes, sorry, not pud changes, of the site plan changes before you tonight. Thank you. And like I said, Mister Brokoff is here if you guys have any other detailed questions about specifics that we may need to address. Thank you, Mister Kowalski. With that, with staff presentation complete, we'll move on to the public hearing. This is an opportunity for persons to speak up to three minutes about this item.

For either method of participation, please state your name and address at the beginning of your comments. And is there anyone present that would like to speak to the commission at this time? Good evening. North Castle leaving at 2201 South Warren Parkway. And I frequented this area a lot because I live very close to County Farm and I really love the greenness that we had there before this development was created. If you go there, you will see that there's hardly any space for any green. I have no idea where there are people that are going to move in there are going to park their cars, so there are going to be a lot of cars parked on the narrow streets that are there and you can just drive there and take a look for yourself. I walk the park, so I walk right past all the construction all the time. I'm very concerned with the increased number of vehicles that will be added with ten additional or eleven additional units as requested. It was originally 99. We're now at 121. And maybe next year they request, I don't know, an additional ten units. So it's concerning for those of us that live in the area that suffer from the terrible traffic now added due to the narrowing of Platte Road from four lanes that we had. We only have two. So you should go there and watch the traffic going on forever. Now everybody's going through the neighborhood. They're very upset about all the flow of traffic going through the neighborhood, cutting through the one single light that's holding hundreds of cars every day. So I'm very concerned about additional cars in the area and the elimination of the greenness that we used to have all over the place there. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks chair Lee Ken Garber. Again, I definitely, I don't live in the neighborhood, so I respect the neighbor's concerns about this project and I think they should be addressed from my point of view. I support these site plan amendments. Viridian is a model project in terms of net zero or positive energy in new construction. What they're doing is they're taking. All I know about these amendments, what I just heard from Mister Kowalski, and that they're converting the planned garages and street pavement to additional dwelling units. I think this is a positive development. It's just more good stuff within this project. I look forward to the discussion, but I support the amendments. Thank you. Do we have anyone else present that would like to address the commission at this time? Seeing none. Do we have remote callers that would like to address the commission? There are no hands raised at this time. Thank you. With that, I'd like. I will close public comment and I will read the proposed motion.

And the other things, the things that you have added, the four additional walk up flats and eight additional micro studios, which have been. These are conversions from other things. It's not more than eleven units, but I'm not going to do all the math here. Those two are less car intensive forms of dwelling. So I think from your perspective, and from my perspective, this plan gives us less of what we don't want, which is fewer garages, fewer things that house cars, and more things that house people in places of driveways. You're giving us bioswales, which is green, and I think that's a win. And you are giving us more housing because you have had such demand for this site, which will presumably take some traffic off of our roads, because you are enabling more people to live in Ann Arbor in a part of town that will be very convenient to jobs and services. So if I've missed something, please let me know. No, very well said. Again, purpose of this was for exactly the reasons that you address. There are too many cars. We design all of our streets and everything else to be for cars. And this neighborhood was kind of doing that balance. And someone on this commission in our first hearing said, can you do more of these micro unit types that did not exist at the time? And we said, we will see. We will try to do that. But this is kind of balancing what the neighborhood wants. The count is lower, but the type of housing is very, very different. We removed five single family homes in order to get these eleven units into this. Plus by removing those garages, adding more housing, removing cars, and then offering, really looking to see how can we do this. My next project, I would like to do car free completely and find other mobility options. And we are exploring those type of things with Viridian. With these units, there is a few less parking spaces. Put parking in and out here and make it very dynamic. But the neighborhood itself, there's abundant parking. There's parking at the church across the street in this neighborhood. And the thing, there's lots of paved spaces around that are unused. But we believe going forward in the future, things like bike share and car share that we will be working on with our homeowners association and figuring out how can we challenge some of the mobility assumptions that we currently have with the existing housing model. And that's just a tiny way that we could do this. And we went through a lot of trouble to do it at an expense to us. This is not a profit motivated thing. This is really an opportunity to show that we can do things a little bit differently next time. And I think going forward, that more of the neighborhoods will look more like this with more elevator accessibility, human scale, less cars. Because we hear you. I disagree with you. Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate the explanation. Do we have other commissioners? Commissioner Mills. Thank you. Thanks for this. This, I think, is a question for staff, but maybe it's a question for you. It was mentioned in the staff report that there was an amendment between our approval of this in October of 2020 and what we're seeing. So I'm curious, did that come before us, or was that one that didn't meet the threshold? And the bigger question is, I'm curious about why it is that we're seeing this, given that it conforms with everything within the zoning. And so what was the. What was the thing within our table that made it come before us? Brett and Alexa said we had to. That's my answer. I could say, I know. Honestly, I don't know I'm sorry about the middle plan. The plan that you just mentioned, that was before this one, in between the originals approval. I'm not sure if that was administrative, but I know this one. Just looking at it, I can tell because of the changing of the vehicular use area, the circulation inside it looks like there may have been some changes. Is that solid waste maybe area? Yeah. So there's some changes in this one that I can see would trigger a site plan. Yeah. Again, just. Just going through, even though the zoning, it fits well within the zoning, our site plan table, I could see, again, change of vehicular use area. There's change of circulation, change of solid waste. So that's just what I see off the top of my head. Fire access. We're moving a road there. Do they still get their fire in circulation changes? Yes. Okay. Each one had to and again, went through a lot of trouble to make sure that we could eliminate some cars. And I'm not. All those things triggered a lot of thread on the sweater. Amazing. As I say, I'm not worried that the iteration in between didn't come to us. I think the question is more like, did this need to come to us? We were ready nine months ago, so that would be fabulous. If we could get these kind of things to go through much easier, because if we wanted to add parking, we probably wouldn't have had to come to you, wh", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Ann Arbor City Planning Commission", "insights": [{"observation": "The Ann Arbor City Planning Commission approves the 22 70 plant road site plan v five, dated April 24, 2024.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}, {"observation": "Transforming a single family dwelling to a multifamily dwelling which is likely a move from a more car intensive form of dwelling to a less car intensive form of dwelling.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The additions of four walk up flats and eight micro studios, which are less car intensive forms of dwelling.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The plan aims to reduce the number of garages and provide more bioswales, which is green.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Enabling more people to live in Ann Arbor in a part of town that will be very convenient to jobs and services.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Removing five single-family homes to add eleven units, which reduces the number of garages and cars.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Exploring other mobility options like bike share and car share.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Emphasis on human scale developments with more elevator accessibility and fewer cars.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Went through a lot of trouble to implement these changes, indicating not profit motivated but focused on community and environmental benefit.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Changes in the site plan triggered necessary compliance with zoning rules including changes to vehicular use area, circulation, and solid waste management.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Ann Arbor City Planning Commission", "insights": [{"observation": "The Ann Arbor City Planning Commission approves the 22 70 plant road site plan v five, dated April 24, 2024.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}, {"observation": "Transforming a single family dwelling to a multifamily dwelling which is likely a move from a more car intensive form of dwelling to a less car intensive form of dwelling.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The additions of four walk up flats and eight micro studios, which are less car intensive forms of dwelling.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The plan aims to reduce the number of garages and provide more bioswales, which is green.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Enabling more people to live in Ann Arbor in a part of town that will be very convenient to jobs and services.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Removing five single-family homes to add eleven units, which reduces the number of garages and cars.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Exploring other mobility options like bike share and car share.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Emphasis on human scale developments with more elevator accessibility and fewer cars.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Went through a lot of trouble to implement these changes, indicating not profit motivated but focused on community and environmental benefit.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Changes in the site plan triggered necessary compliance with zoning rules including changes to vehicular use area, circulation, and solid waste management.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1707208, "chunk_end_time": 2105914, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXmiuhRW-kE", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXmiuhRW-kE&t=1707s"}, {"start": 24000, "end": 30000, "text": "ybe area?

If we could get these kind of things to go through much easier, because if we wanted to add parking, we probably wouldn't have had to come to you, which. Yeah, I'm just thinking this might warrant, and maybe you'll see this in commission proposed business later on, revisiting kind of that table again, of what things forced them to come to us, because, again, it meets. It complies. And so I understand, like, if there's an internal to the city, making sure all the departments, again, the fire truck can get down on the solid waste, but to schedule this. And there's a cost associated with coming before our body, too. So we don't. But for the public, we don't get paid just for what it's worth. We even have to pay for our own babysitters. The other thing that I would note here is that this is a situation where the PUD regulations were flexible enough to allow for this, blessedly right, that we. That we set up a max density that gave us a little bit of flexibility. And also the mix of units allowed for one of the things. In going back and reviewing this, looking at the supplemental regs about what was required, it was important to us when we originally thought about this development that it include a mix of units, and that was obviously important to the plan. Too. One of the things that I noted. And so the, the supplemental reg said, you know, 10% of the units needed to be detached single family, and at minimum, and 30% needed to be. I can pull it up something other attached single family, and then minimum 20% being multifamily dwellings. I noticed in your table that you are exactly at the 30% attached single family townhomes. And I'm curious if that percentage mix, like the extent to which the supplemental regs are really tying you in, or would there be a more ideal, or that actually you're happy with where things are now and that wasn't actually hampering. Yeah, that did not factor into it, those numbers. I think that's probably coincidence. I think we were more impacted by the framework of fire code than anything else. You know, that really limits the ability. I'm just going to give a public plug here for single stair access. This is something everyone on this planning commission should be advocating very strongly for at the state level. A couple of states just recently have signed on, meaning that if we could do single stair access, many of these single family home buildings could be structured as multifamily buildings with a single stair access and potentially even an elevator access. And you can increase floor plan efficiencies with single stair access by up to 20%, which means you have 20% more housing or 20% less costly housing with no additional land that's required. Again, this is something that's being allowed in other jurisdictions. It's already been allowed in Europe, and it's not evidence based fire code that you need to stair accesses the types of materials you use have a greater impact on fire risk than the number of stairs you have. Synthetic materials. Flashover point is three to four minutes. Natural materials, it's 30 minutes. So I'd ask you, which building would you rather live in? One that gives you 30 minutes to escape, but they'll give you two ways out, or one way out, or they'll give you two ways out, but you only have four minutes to escape. So it's kind of a silly thing. It's a single stair access is a very big issue that's taking hold, and we need to let it take hold so that we're a leader in this as quickly as possible at the state level, and that's really helpful. That something that you just noted is outside of our purview. However, every so often, we do get, the planning commission gets to weigh in on what our legislative priorities for the city are in Lansing. And this is something that is really helpful for us to make sure is on the long list of the things that the city of Ann Arbor is kind of lobbying for in terms of changes. So thank you for happy to share reports on single stair access with you guys so that you guys can educate yourself and be advocates for it at the state level. Thanks. Thank you. Any other commissioners comments? I think council member dish pretty much summed it up for me. I did take a look. I understand, and I hear your comments with respect to traffic. So I did just pull up Semcog numbers for traffic counts on Platte Road as well as South Huron Parkway. So it looks like it's about 15,000 vehicles per day. And so the additional of anywhere from ten to 22 vehicles would not be a material detriment. But I just wanted to kind of set it in context of how many vehicles per day trips are being registered currently. So we hear you, but I believe the units will not have garages. We will not have garages. We don't believe in housing for cars and frankly, even parking for cars. There should be other mobility options. And to your point, Commissioner Desch, we are really trying to create the type of housing that people can get around, and these are people who wouldn't necessarily want to spend money on a car or have the money to buy a car and then still be able to own their own home.

It's certainly not to detract from your, you know, empirical experience with the site, and so we certainly appreciate you taking the time to come speak with us. So thank you. With that respect, do I have any other commissioners? Okay, we'll go to the vote. I'm going to rewrite the proposed city planning commission motion. The Ann Arbor City Planning Commission approves the 22 70 Platte road site plan dated April 21 4th, 2024. Staff. McKelley. Adams. Yay. Is that a yes? Yes. Weatherby. Yes. Mills. Yes. Dish. Yes. Hammerschmitt? Is recused. Weiss. Yes. Abrams. Yes. Lee. Yes. That. That passes. That carries. Thank you. Good luck. Yeah, please. Thank you. I will. Okay. We'll give her just a few minutes. Give us 1 minute. Can I ask a question? Yeah, sure. So did we get an answer to commissioner Mill's question about why this came here? It was just the movement. I know the developer spoke, but was it just the movement of the cars? Was that the answer? There's a couple of reasons. I spotted the moving of the solid waste receptacles, the change of circulation, the vehicular use area changes that's connected to the circulation access drives. So there's a couple of them that's just at the top. And again, I apologize. I didn't do the actual analysis, but I know just looking at this, those are things that right away would kick it to site plan. Okay. That's correct. Planner Qualsky is absolutely. And if you would like to know what the triggers are for yourself in the unified Development Code, which for our listening public can be downloaded at eight two. Gov.org uDC Table 5.291 has required approvals for development activities by land use. And one of the items on of the current edition on page 211, if you are constructing a new or relocating existing access road or driveway, which there was in this case for residential seven or more dwelling units, or all other uses, for example, group housing, mixed use. Those have a p for planning commission. So if you take a look at some of the items that were just mentioned by planner Qualsky, and through your knowledge from the presentation staff report, you can see which items for that all other uses would have triggered. And it was more than one item. And just a quick follow up. Was the developer correct when they stated that if they wanted to add parking, they would not have had to come? I don't know about that. Yeah, I'd have to verify it. Depends on where they would add it. Okay. So I'd have to check into that. Great. Thank you so much. And thanks for the reference in the UDC. Yeah. And what percentage we would have to look into the pud right now. Oh, that's true. Even if there's a max part. Yeah, yeah, of course. Thank you. All right, we're going to move on to item number nine b. This is regular business, 3310 Washtenaw. This is the chick fil a site plan for planning commissioner approval SB 23 0017. This is a proposed demolition of existing restaurant and construction of a new 5240 square foot restaurant building and 50 new parking spaces. The site is zoned c three fringe commercial, and no drive through is proposed. With that, I believe we have a petition presentation. Got it. Sounds good. So welcome. Thank you. And then the right close. Close. It's really hard to see. Yep. That little one right there. And then full screen. Perfect. Perfect. Okay. All right. Good evening, chair Lee, members of the commission. Thanks for having us. I'm Justin Lurk. I'm our project development lead. For this project, I covered the midwest region for Chick fil A, address is 5200 Buffington Road, Atlanta, Georgia. And then with me is Leslie Accardo. She'll go through a few things here in a little bit as well, but we'll try to just give you a quick elevator speech of chick fil A and then we'll dig into the site plan for you all to consider. So if you're not familiar with Chick fil A, just a family owned, privately held company, little franchise location, little bit different than most franchise locations. And the fact that you can only, you're only guaranteed one location. So you can't come into Michigan and say, hey, I'm going to open up 25 Chick fil A's, you have to apply for a specific location. You get selected for a specific location. If that location does very well and we need to open up one nearby, you may qualify for a second, but you cap out at three. So very, very different than most franchisees. And that's really our secret sauce and kind of our bread and butter is our local owner operators that kind of living in the community at which they work, just making those personal connections, building the team, really big on building the team members that we have.

So it's not just a job, it's a career. We see a lot of owner operators starting as a team member, working their ways up, applying three and owners, owner operator and become an entrepreneur in that aspect. So just a quick overview of chick fil a there. Big on giving back to the communities again and where we operate for the site that's in front of you, if you're not familiar with it, the former Denny's site, this is unique to Michigan, so worked on every, all 23 open locations we have in the state of Michigan. This will be the first one, one without a drive through. So respecting the, you know, the wants and wishes of the community here. So we'd be looking at taking the former Denny's location, kind of scraping that building and putting in a more energy efficient building in its place. About the same size, about the same amount of parking. We'll go through that as well. And then as you can see here, main access is off of access drive, not off of, of Washtenaw Avenue. And then there's public parking on that main frontage road, access drive as well. So this is what the location looked like when it was open as a Denny's restaurant. So this is from the access drive looking into the property. And then this is from the back of the property, looking at the back of the building, kind of towards Washtenaw Avenue and then these would be the proposed elevations of the chick fil a building, all brick building. The top left corner is what you would see from that service drive. So the patio up front the building, and then the top right corner, again from. From the access drive. The bottom left corner is the main face that you see there, with not many windows, just the transom windows that would be right up against the pet people building. And that's our back of the house. That's our kitchen, which is why I don't see a lot of windows on that. And then the bottom right hand corner is what you would see from the parking field. So those are just some of the proposed elevations. And then this is a preliminary site plan and a landscape plan. So new landscaping throughout the property. I mentioned the outdoor patio. Looking to have some tables so people can enjoy the warmer months, albeit maybe two or three a year. Right. But some of the warmer months, we've got a lot of feedback from our customers in Michigan that they love the opportunity to go sit outside. So patio tables fronting the service drive in Washtenaw was important to us. And then on the backside of the property, there's existing cross access with that pet people location. We're planning to keep that there as well. And then one enhancement looking to do is add the EV charging stations into this development as well. So six of those, and then bicycle parking spaces as well. So that's just a high level overview. I'll turn it over to Leslie. She'll walk through some of the more engineering type stuff, and we'll be here for questions. Good evening. So we are proposing an underground storage system. So currently there's nothing in place at the existing site. Will be proposing 18,000 stormwater. It will go through an isolator row, so that will be part of the water quality before going into the existing storm system. And this was not previously part of the existing site for Chick fil A. We worked with Washtenaw county water Resources prior to even starting the project. We did infiltration testing. Unfortunately, there isn't. The soil's bad, and there's also. It's hard to tell from here, but there's a great deal of structures and easements and all sorts of other things that are going on with this site. So we were unable to do Bioswales as a part of it. So we requested a landscape modification because of that. And then we're incorporating some sustainable features. So Justin mentioned the EV charging stations with capacity for additional. The bike racks, again, the underground detention system and exterior lighting. So they'll have cutoff fixtures to reduce glare, timers to allow for ability to control remotely, and local and led fixtures that utilize typically a lot less than a standard fixture. So with the building features, they typically like to provide Leed or AShrAe 90.0 energy best practices. And that incorporates external glazing with low e white thermoplastic roofing membranes, interior lighting, high performance led fixtures, and then the back of house kitchen appliances are all electric and energy stars. So dishwashers, ice machines, all that sort of thing. And just a quick shout out to the staff too. I mean, they've been amazing to work with, so really appreciate everything that they've done to get us to this point. And so if anyone have any questions. Thank you. With that, I believe we go to staff presentation. We'll go to public comment and then make the discussion. Thank you. Thank you. And we have a pretty quick presentation on this one. Just a couple of summary items. One thing I wanted to note off the beginning is in the proposed city planning commission motion. I wanted to add the date of the site plan in the version.

And that incorporates external glazing with low e white thermoplastic roofing membranes, interior lighting, high performance led fixtures, and then the back of house kitchen appliances are all electric and energy stars. So dishwashers, ice machines, all that sort of thing. And just a quick shout out to the staff too. I mean, they've been amazing to work with, so really appreciate everything that they've done to get us to this point. And so if anyone have any questions. Thank you. With that, I believe we go to staff presentation. We'll go to public comment and then make the discussion. Thank you. Thank you. And we have a pretty quick presentation on this one. Just a couple of summary items. One thing I wanted to note off the beginning is in the proposed city planning commission motion. I wanted to add the date of the site plan in the version. So it's dated for 120 24 and it's version three. So whoever, if and when we get to the point of a motion, if somebody could include that as well, please. Okay, again, kind of just in summary, as the petitioner just went over, they're going to raise the existing building that's there now. It's approximately 100 or so square feet larger than the proposed one. They are including a patio that was shown on one of their plans there in the front for an outdoor seating area as well. And the existing site access is only the one curb cut from the Washtenaw service drive. There is parking allowed on part of the Wash Nosh service Drive. Now it's an interesting. There's not parking actually allowed directly in front of their site on that service drive. But when we, when the applicant initially came in, we explored that with transportation team and our engineering and say, why isn't there? And nobody really had a good answer. So, because if you'll see from aerial photos, there's parking all up and down that service drive. So it did come to a point with the discussions at the transportation team that if, if the petitioner or somebody wants to basically say, can we install parking here, that it could be striped, there would be a procedure for that, so they could follow up with that as well. But as you can see again from the aerial photos, there's enough parking in other areas of that access drive that is public parking. They're providing, obviously 50 vehicular spaces on their site as well. They are installing ev parking and the chargers, per code, they're actually installing, I believe a couple. Three. I think it's three more. So then code requires, again, existing. The access is not changing. They have access that's also provided to the rear of the site that was shown on their site plan. So that helps with solid waste as well as well as fire access and obviously just general transportation. Stormwater. As was indicated, there's no stormwater on the site currently at all. They are providing full stormwater detention. Related to stormwater detention is the landscape model modification. Again, that's a separate what we included in the site plan motion. It could be pulled out for whatever reason, but we included it all as one motion. So the landscape modification, it is supported by staff. It was basically. It's concluded that that was required through soil samples and typical soil borings that we usually do. So again, the landscape modification is to eliminate the bioretention islands. All other landscaping does meat code, including the conflicting land use buffer along the rear. Although just to the rear of the site, there's pretty heavily vegetated areas. Well, as the creek actually comes out there, which is part of where the. The applicant had indicated, there's a lot of restrictions on the site. There's actually a creek that goes underneath part of. You'll see from the areas how the pet people building is kind of angled like that. Well, there's an. A huge drain commission easement across the site as well as this site too, that they had to stay well out of, even though for the most part, the creek underneath it is relatively small. But again, that issue, that's through the county's jurisdiction. They handled that. They're okay with it. They have approved. Given their approval to the plan. And really, again, that pretty much covers the staff report. This is a project that does comply with the c three zoning district. So staff is recommending approval at this time of both the site plan as well as the landscape modification. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Mister Kowalski. All right, we're moving on to public hearing. This is an opportunity for persons to speak up to three minutes about this item.

It's already bad enough, meaning that the lights are so out of order that they don't maintain flow. I am a PhD industrial engineer, so I know what I'm talking about. Flow lights on Washtenaw Avenue are not well designed, meaning that you go there during traffic time. You will see that the cars accumulate at the Huron Parkway and Washtenaw Avenue intersection. And sometimes you can't go out because the cars are blocking your way if you're on South Huron Parkway. So we already have a problem with a lot of additional traffic coming into chick fil a. It's a very popular restaurant, so there's going to be a lot of additional cars trying to get in and out. I can't imagine what this is going to look like. I have no idea where the 50 parking spaces are. But my concern, again, is that we lived. We used to live in a very quiet neighborhood until all these viridians of the world and the restaurants and the TC one corridor and all these new inventions that are causing a lot of problem to the residents that were already there before all these planning started. So I'm very concerned about the traffic, the pollution. I live there. I have to breathe the air that comes out. I have to hear the sounds of the cars in the parking lot because my unit is just a. About 100ft away from the parking lot of chick fil a of the future. So I'm a very concerned citizen, and I would like the commission to really address not only the fact that there is a restaurant that wants to be established there, but that this creates additional problem in the neighborhood. Okay? And I live in a c three area, but it's not commercial. We have residents there. We're people. We have units, we have apartments there. So that's something that I needed to bring out to the attention of the commission. Thank you very much. Thank you. Do we have any other speakers that would like to publicly comment? 10 seconds. You're cutting me off. Oh, there we go. I wouldn't blame you, actually. So, Ken Garber again. Yeah. I don't like this development either, but for different reasons. It got a sustainability review and it pretty much failed all the way down the line. I'm going to focus on two aspects, solar and compost. The OSI reviewer asked for on site solar. As usual, this was the reply. Renewable energy will not be provided on site. We have reviewed this request with the site lighting manufacturer to determine if there was an opportunity to utilize solar lighting. The vendor has determined that the best options provide less than half the required lumens for standard chick fil A fixtures. We also have some concerns about environmental conditions that would result in an unsafe environment for pedestrians and customers. End quote. This puzzles me because Chick fil A, now to its credit, has converted three restaurants to microgrids using solar panels to power these buildings. They're in Stockton, Santa Rosa and Oceanside, California, and the company says it wants to do more solar, including new construction. A Chick fil a press release called the Stockton restaurant, quote, a win win for both local owner operators and the community, end quote. So obviously at these restaurants, solar panels are compatible with, with chick fil A fixtures, and they don't create an unsafe environment for pedestrians and customers, whatever that means. Okay. On compost, when asked to provide compost bins, this petitioner's response was, compost bins will not be utilized, period. This is interesting, too. I just looked at the 2023 Chick fil a Global Impact report. From the report, quote, as more towns and cities develop the infrastructure for community wide composting, local chick fil A owner operators are actively composting food scraps, end quote. I don't know if chick fil a food waste would be accepted at Ann Arbor's composting facility, but for places without community composting, the report cites a digester technology called Orca that many chick fil A restaurants are using to break down food waste into liquid that's safe for municipal waste, wastewater treatment plants. Also from the Chick fil a report. Quote, we work hard to be efficient with the food we have, but when it comes to food scraps or the occasional bun that has dropped on the floor, the orca digester is the perfect solution. End quote. It goes on. Combined, these efforts across Chick fil a help bring us closer to achieving our goal of diverting 25 million pounds of restaurant food waste to landfill by 2025. Since 2020, we have diverted approximately 23.6 million pounds and will continue to emphasize this priority in our restaurant communities. End quote. So while I appreciate the no drive thru, 3310 Washington not only fails the city's requirements, it doesn't even meet. Apparently, it doesn't even meet Chick fil A's own standards. And let's just say chick fil A is not known as a particularly progressive company. Thank you. Thank you. Would anybody else present like to address the commission? Okay, seeing none. Do we have any remote callers? There are no hands raised right now. Thank you. Okay, just give me one more second. Okay, we're going to close public comment on this particular motion and I will read it.

Okay, we're going to close public comment on this particular motion and I will read it. The Ann Arbor City Planning Commission approves the 3310 Washtenaw site plan with landscape modifications to remove the requirements for biofiltration islands due to poor soil, which does not allow infiltration as it complies with all applicable requirements of the Unified Development Code and other applicable laws, ordinances, standards and regulations. Moved by. Oh yes, I will add 3310 Washington site plan. April 1, 2024, version three. I was actually going to see if it requires formal amendment to the motion, but I will just add it now. April 1, 2024, site plan, version three. Moved by commissioner Mills. Seconded by councilmember Dish. We are in discussion. Would anyone like to kick us off? Commissioner Hammerschmitt, thank you. As we fight over that. So I'll just pick up where Mister Garber left off, because in reading the response, I feel like this is specifically about sight lighting. Have you thought about rooftop solar? We had reached out to our lighting consultant and asked them to provide some feedback on this based on the location, climate, that sort of thing, you know, specific to Michigan. And their concerns were that they would not be able to meet the requirements needed for safety for employees and customers. But is that not for site light, rooftop solar to generate electricity for like running the building? I don't know that I can speak to that. Yeah, I'll have to look into that for you. But for any of the projects that I've worked on to date across the midwest, we haven't utilized any of the solar panels like in the Midwest region. I know he had mentioned three. You know, three of our 3000 locations have utilized that today. But I know in the Midwest region we have not. Yeah, I think California requires it now, so that makes sense. But solar does work in Michigan. I don't know what your lighting guy was talking about. And I'll just say one thing and then I'll pass it to you. Well, that's okay. Wait, what was it? No, it's okay. Oh my God. I totally lost my train of thought. Oh, I. Okay. I appreciate that you understand our body enough to know that coming to us with a drive thru was probably a nonstarter. And I do have some questions about that I'm going to ask later. But you have to know that this is really, really important to the city of Ann Arbor. We have really aggressive sustainability goals and climate action goals. And I guess I just feel like the responses that you've provided to OsI aren't what we would like to hear from a developer, especially building a new construction building. Understand that we are not requiring it, but we can't because of the state. But it's really important to Ann Arbor. And if anybody else wants to ask questions related to that, I'm going to yield for now, commissioner weich. So can we see the site plan that shows the flow of traffic? It has arrows on it. I don't know if we can bring that up on the screen. This one here. Perfect. That should work. There's one in the site plan that is a little more. Has movement, it seems I have in here. Right, sorry. Maybe truck turning movements. Yeah, it's page six of 25 in the actual site plan document. Do we have access to that for the screen? Yes, I can. If Mister Kowalski wants to share screen, I can switch the screen view. No, actually this is it. I think it's showing the fire truck movement. I think is with arrows. Is this the one? I can't see from there, but I'm gonna trust you. Well, yeah, that's it. I think it's either. Well, there's another one. There's two, actually. The one that you're on now. Okay. I think it's fine. So my questions are around pedestrian safety. So how are you mitigating people parking and crossing this traffic? So if they're parking like on what you see is like the left side of anywhere in this site. So I am a parent of three kids. We've parked our car, we now have to go into the restaurant, but there's this flow. So how like, how are you sort of thinking about like how you've laid out the site? How are you prioritizing pedestrian safety in this layout? Sure. So we've got the. I believe it's 24, is it 24 foot wide drive aisle here for two way traffic, which is pretty common and customary, like for two way traffic with 90 degree angled park. So you can park on either side of the drive aisle just like any other restaurant or shop center. So we've got parking spaces immediately adjacent to the building. And then we've got some on the left side of the screen as well. We've got some on the south side. There's a sidewalk leading from the spaces where you see the mouse right now all the way to the front door. So anything on the right hand side of the screen or the south, there's a sidewalk that would lead you right to the door without having to cross the internal drive aisle. But the parking space is on the left hand side. You would. Would have to cross the drive out to get to the front door. And is there a plan that shows the lighting or any of the striping in the parking lot in terms of like a crosswalk ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Chick-fil-A", "insights": [{"observation": "Combined, these efforts across Chick-fil-A help bring us closer to achieving our goal of diverting 25 million pounds of restaurant food waste to landfill by 2025.

I've seen people backed up for a mile sort of trying to access your restaurant and the movement of humans across. That is just something that I wanted to highlight as we were looking at this plan to understand how you were hoping to sort of mitigate that. And I think I have two questions. One, do you have a typical count for trip visits to your restaurants, and especially here in the midwest, that you would be willing to share? Sure. So this one's quite different from. Right, because it doesn't have a drive. Right. Drive thru. But that was a non starter. So we look at transactions. Right. How many times the register goes off? A lot of times you could have multiple transactions per car. But on average, we see anywhere from 1200 to 1800 transactions a day at our full service restaurant with a drive through. And have you broken that down by hour? Pardon? By hour, like for a peak hour? Is that what you're looking for? Like, we have the whole foods gets like 500 daily car visits or Costco gets 500 visits an hour, so. Or something we heard when we were looking at something on State street, and that was, like, such a high number. And then I realized, well, that's probably true because of how difficult it is to get in and out. So just trying to think about, like, what is it going to produce in terms of. Because it's just, it's a car centric restaurant, so people are driving into this, and so, like, pedestrian safety is, I think, the concern that I'm trying to assess and I'm trying to get at it through some information, so. Sure. Yeah. I mean, our typical peak hours over, like a lunch hour or a dinner hour, those are obviously our busiest times. We do offer breakfast. We're open 06:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. monday through Saturday, closed on Sundays. But a typical peak hour for a full service restaurant with a drive thru can range anywhere from 100 to 150 cars per hour during a peak hour. This obviously doesn't have a drive through. We'll have spaces dedicated for grubhub, uber eats, things like that to take food to people that may not have cars in the community. Like, we under, like you just heard from the petitioner before us, so that's how we plan on servicing the community here. And then a follow up question and then I'll yield for now, is do you do app delivery to the car? So could I order, park and then have someone bring the food out to my car? That is an option that the local owner operator could choose to utilize at this location. So we could actually just have all the parking full of folks that are expecting people to come out. So it's a walkout, not a drive through, plus backup of people trying to access the lot. If this owner chooses to have those deliveries come from the store out to a parked vehicle. Is that correct? Ask the first. You're saying every parking spot could be. No, I'm just saying it is possible that if this owner chooses that the whole parking lot could be full of people that are receiving deliveries as opposed to parking going into the store. I do know we don't have a restaurant in the chain where all spaces are designated for pickup. Typically, that's three to five spaces per location. So they're designated, correct. Okay. All right. That's a helpful distinction. Correct. Though people may ignore that designation. People do lots of things right. Okay. All right, great. I will yield for someone else and come back later. Thank you. Any other commissioners councilmember Dish? Thank you. Thanks for coming. And again, I will voice appreciate for you not asking about a drive thru and I understand that that is a departure for you, and it's a loss. But I will just mention to you that we do have commercial composting available in Ann Arbor through Mygreen, Michigan, and that I would urge you to check out whether it is something that you have to pay for. It's not a city service that you sign up for, but given the weight of food waste and how much it costs to dump that in a landfill, you might be better off composting. And then that would be something that you could advertise, because Ann arborites like that. So thank you for being willing to check that out. Absolutely.

And one other item we didn't mention kind of goes along the lines of composting. One thing that a lot of our owner operators do is participate in a program called Shared Table. So any food that is still within its availability to eat timeframe, partner with local charities to donate that food versus throwing it away. So we do have food gatherers in Ann Arbor whom you could speak with them. I don't know if they. I mean. Yes. That's great. Thank you. Good. Thank you. Miss Cher Abrams. I'm just pointing out a small discrepancy between the site plan and the staff report. The site plan says 50 parking spaces and the staff report says 52. Yep. I just, I noticed that actually, before you did 50 parking spaces as well. Okay. Yep. I'm not in. I'm not in the restaurant business. That seems like a lot of parking for. I think I counted. There are 90 some seats total in the restaurant, so you'd have to have, like, every single seat full and less than two people per car to have that lot full. I guess you also have doordash, et cetera. And anyway, it feels like a lot of parking, but. And then that was all. And then we can't require it, but just would really encourage you to look at rooftop solar. It feels like low hanging fruit, essentially, in this location. Something for you to look into. Thank you. Thank you. Any other commissioners commission mills? This just came to my mind because we, on the previous petition, we looked at table 5.291 about the things that come before us, and I just want to verify with staff that among the, among the reasons that this is coming before us is because it is a new building that is non residential. Is that right? That's correct. So it's not just about the landscape modification? Oh, no, no. It would, yes. Because they're demolishing the existing restaurant and it's a whole new building. Yes. That's why. Okay. Wanted to thanks. But with that, obviously come all the other code requirements. Landscaping being one of them. Exactly. And had they reused the Denny's and remodeled, they wouldn't be here. Right. Okay. So, I mean, from my perspective, this is a use that is permitted in this district is because it's a new building. It's a shame that it doesn't have, you know, some of the sustainability features that we're looking for now that we weren't looking for when the Denny's was built. And that also, again, I'll just chime in that, like, now is a really good time. And we've actually just had changes in state policy that make it easier to access rooftop solar. So, like, that's in this market. Like, that's a good thing. In terms of the parking or the anticipated traffic. In terms of parking spots, it's. The Denny's has 53, so it's not that different. I appreciate that it's pulled up to the road. I appreciate that. Again, I will chime in my thanks for awareness of the kind of market that we have and not wanting to add additional drive thrus. And I, every time I've been to or been by a chick fil a, there has been lots of park or lots of cars queued for the drive thru. So I'm curious how that's gonna work here. On the other hand, if there is to be a queue, the fact that there's the service drive here is better than almost any other place in Ann Arbor that I can think of. For that, I hope that people park and walk and come in and use the patio. But again, in terms of the number of seats, because of the footprint and also just the number of parking spots, it's not that different than what's there right now. So I encourage you to look at composting, to look at rooftop solar. But this appears to me to meet the code and the landscape modification because the site conditions don't allow for the required landscaping to properly function. Seems reasonable to me. Thank you. Any other commissioners? Commissioner Weich. This is more for staff, and it was to address the public commenters traffic concerns. Where is the best place for that conversation? Because we don't have much control over the traffic flow. We are a transportation team, transportation engineering. They would be the one. They look at all the light coordinations, light timing issues like that. And again, just in terms of the number of trips, this is not going to create a demonstrative impact to the number of trips that are already on Washtenaw because we're at, what, 30,000 a day on Washington. I mean it's a pretty intense use. But correct compared to what's on Washington. They did submit. I was trying to look it up. They did submit traffic information and everything else that was reviewed. Now again to the public commenters concern. The shopping complex that they are adjacent to has a few curb cuts into it. And I appreciate the concern about traffic. I work on Platte Road. So I understand that we're going to have more neighbors and more traffic. But we can't mitigate that completely here because they're not creating enough trips to offset what's happening on Washtenaw. Because it's 35. So if this was a smaller road. Let's say 500 trips and then they came in then there might be something that planning could do to address it. But because Washtenaw and Platte has 15,000.

But because Washtenaw and Platte has 15,000. Huron Valley probably has. Huron River Drive probably has 20,000 trips. So in this neighborhood there's just a lot of cars that are already there. And so there's very much very little that we can do here. Again my concerns are just about pedestrian safety. You're going to have a lot of cars coming in and out of this. So anything that you can do in your design to sort of help mitigate that I think would be appreciated. I appreciate you Mister Garber. Bringing up the annual reports. Just as a reflection. Back to you around the rooftop solar. So as been noted here. And our office of Sustainability and Innovation already gave you feedback on that. The composting again is something that seems like a very low hanging fruit thing. And I think it would just be helpful. And I don't know again if this is a staff question or comment for staff. Just when the petitioner brought up their sustainability. The thing that triggered in my mind is what's required by code and what are they providing that's in addition. And I think the only thing I heard that they were providing that's an addition is three additional EV spots. But everything else is required by code. Correct. Right. Okay. So there. There really wasn't. Well I mean there could be some. I don't know. Electrical code and things like that. There could be things buried in there. But. Correct. The most obvious issue that we see is the additional EV parking. Right. So that would just be a little bit more forthcoming then to try to say that this is something that is being done towards sustainability. We actually require these things. And so that's the floor. So it would be helpful there. But you might not be back for another site here in Ann Arbor. So that may be lost in this opportunity, but I think that was it. Thanks, Charlie. Thank you. Any other commissioners comments? Okay, a few thoughts on my end. We'll echo, take a look at solar. That would be great. Just for the commission's reference point, it adds up to about 9.5 spaces per thousand square feet, which I will say it's a little bit on the higher side of things. Just from a commercially reasonable standpoint. Office, you'll see four spots per thousand. And restaurant, you do expect to see somewhere between five and nine is a little on the high side. But again, there was 53 on the existing site. So totally understood. With that respect, the only part that I kind of took a look at is landscape modification requirements. If the soil is unsuitable for filtration, that is one of the items that is required. So I believe that that fits. I did look at section 5.20.1. It does say it was the promote the public health by reducing noise, air pollution grade. And then I think it's subsection g, which is the site conditions, including soil type. It's to promote the preservation of existing significant vegetation and reducing the negative impacts of stormwater runoff by reducing impervious surface area. I think the addition of 18,000 cubic feet of retention is pretty significant, especially for a site that doesn't currently have it. So I think that's so. All in all, I believe that this fits from a permitted use standpoint as well as the dimensional standards in the Washington County Resource Commissioner's review. I will also say to address again, I want to emphasize how grateful I am that public commenters will come to speak at these things. So it always takes a lot. You're here on a Tuesday night, so we certainly appreciate the civic engagement. I will just a point of reference, I'm looking at the Semcoc traffic volume map. So you can go online, Google Semcock traffic count, and that'll tell you kind of of what some, that's the southeastern Michigan Council of governments, and so it's a regional entity that measures traffic. And commissioner weich did mention, yeah, it looks like from here about 37,600 vehicles per day. And for just point of clarification, Platt is south of that. When it connects, just go check out the, if anybody's interested, take a look at the SemCog map as far as this, this particular site plan is concerned. I believe it fits. So with that, do we have any other commissioners with any closing thoughts on discussion? Okay with that, I'm going to read the motion, and we are going to go to a vote. So the proposed city planning commission motion is. The Ann Arbor City Planning Commission approves the 3310 Washtenaw site plan dated April 1, 2024, version three with landscape modification to remove the requirement for for vial filtration islands due to poor soil conditions, which does not allow infiltration as it complies with all applicable requirements of the UDC, the unified Development Code, and all other applicable laws, ordinances, standards and regulations.

I didn't advise them to make a presentation. Just ask them to be available if there's any questions. No immediate plans for the land, just by administrative cleaning it up. Okay, sounds good.

I'm going to read the motion, which is the Ann Arbor City Planning Commission hereby recommends that the mayor and city council approve annexation and public land zoning of 28 62 Stone School road moved by Commissioner Mills and seconded by Commissioner Abrams, who are in discussion. Council member dish. I would like to ask a really basic question. So this has to be zoned public land because it's the school buying it? Yes. Well, that is, yeah, that's what we would zone. All public property for the schools is typically zone pl. Okay. It doesn't have to be necessarily. I mean, there's schools that are zoned r1.02 reals, but Pl is the standard zoning district. Oh. So if they wanted to maybe monetize it sometime, they could. You're already laughing. They could zone it. They could ask some other zoning category. Because if it's public land now, can you rezone that or does it require a. Yes, they could request a rezoning or a future seller contingent upon, same as we do other petitions. If they were interested in selling it and they did have a buyer, they could petition contingent upon, you know, the rezoning, like we do for other site plans. So, yes, it could be rezoned from Pl later. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Wasn't such a dumb question. That's a good question. Commissioner Mills. It looks like it's surrounded by public land, too, so like, that makes it tricky. One of the questions that I have. So in terms of like what to zone it, that's, I think that it probably makes sense right now. It looks like there's sidewalks there now in front of it. Is that seam right? That's what Google Street View shows me. This is on the west side of the street. Yeah. Yes, it is on the west side. I'm zooming in. Yeah. Yes, there's this. It looks like it's like right on the road, but yes, there is a sidewalk along there. Yes. Okay. I was just curious if there was any other, by having it in the city fold rather than in township, what the other implications are. No, I mean, because again, at this time, it's just an annexation. They're not proposing development. If they're proposing any kind of development on the site, we would certainly recommend, or I don't know that we can necessarily require a sidewalk, but, or like maybe a different sidewalk arrangement or something to move it further. But at this point, it's just an annexation. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Any other comments? Yeah, sure. Commissioner weich. So they would only come to play planning the school if they are interfacing with fire, sewer, water. Otherwise the school district would be able to build whatever they wanted on it. They could, but we've had site plans that come through planning commission previously for other school. I'm trying to think back a while, but yes, they're not required to go through, but we do have a public project review that we would put it through as well.

Is it occupied at this. This time? Thank you, commissioners. Good evening. Right now it's scheduled for deconstruction and demolition. Thank you. Sorry, could you give your name again, please? Jason Bing with Ann Arbor public schools. Thank you. Thank you. Any other comments? Oh, yes, Commissioner Abrams, Mister Bing, you could stay. Is this site slated for a new, new school building, new extension of pathways? Yes. So right now we are working with the city planning department and stormwater and the fire marshal on a plan review for potential new pathways. And it would sit on this site just to the south. Great. Thank you. Just a clarification, because I think you said, Mister Kolsky, there are no plans for this site. Plan submittal. Yes, there's a site plan submittal. So the interesting part about our process is that we're a state regulated entity, and so the interface with the city is basically where our utilities handshake off the site. And so we're petitioning or annexing this property so that we can have access to city utilities and that those handshakes can exist. But there's no site planning. Planning right now that we have. There's engineering. I believe that their reviews go straight to civil engineering review and there are optional planning comments. The reviewer for those for this project, I believe was Grayson Moore, which is why you might not have seen them. Okay. Okay. So that goes to perfect question Commissioner Weich's reason for that. So I apologize. That was misinformation. So. And I'm sorry I didn't stand up right away, because there's two stone school properties that have the addresses backwards. So thank you for that clarification. That helps the other property. There's absolutely zero happening. But this one on stone school is in fact right now in planning review. There is a site plan review. Yeah, there is a civil plan review for it. I did note that, but I thought it was just for engineering it. Okay, but that explains it. Thank you. Any other commissioner comments? Commissioner Weich, so since there is a site plan, because there is a potential site that's coming here, do you plan to like, we won't be able to see anything that comes into that. Well, because my concern is about the, again, the flow of traffic and the pedestrian safety because the school district is undergoing new development across the entire district. And there's been, I think, some confusion between the school district and the city about having drop offs in front or attached to the schools. And we talked at the Lawton school conversation and I talked to city staff about it, and both city council members in the fourth ward tried to track down what I heard from you, that the city would not allow you to stage parking and drop off instead of having it on site. They could not find anybody in the city who said that. And so I just don't understand how we interface together and so I don't know how to get the right information to you so that you are aware that the city is quite interested in reducing car centric development of these schools as you are building them, because this is our opportunity to change the car centrality of having cars go right up to the building as opposed to staging areas. So for your information, councilmember Iyer would be happy to chat with you because she both lives in the Lawton area, is interested in that. And I would be interested in whatever ways that we can interface to make sure that as we build this out with these new schools, that we can minimize this car centric drop off and pickup. Sure. Yeah, no, and I apologize if there was confusion. I mean, our process is that we work directly with transportation and worth planning and with stormwater and with the fire marshal on the process. And with your permission. Sure. I'm happy to email you the responses that I got from our city council members as a direct response of our conversation at Lawton, because apparently there is no one in the city that is opposed to you staging drop off and pick up, especially as we are building these new schools. And I just think this is a wonderful opportunity for us to prioritize the free movement of kids to their schools without the centrality of cars being involved in that. Thank you. Thank you.

Welcome back. 3800 1 st School Road annexation and zoning AAPS project 240 zero two. Petitioner request annexation of a vacant three acre parcel in Pittsfield Township and Pl zoning. Petitioner is requesting annexation of the parcel since it is within the contiguous bounded limits of the city for educational use and access to utilities. The parcel has no direct access to any road, but does abut the existing Ann Arbor Public School. Is Bryant elementary School currently zoned PL on the northeast side? My alma mater staff recommendation is approval any presentation. Cool. That pretty much sums it up. Thank you. Yeah, sounds good. This one truly is vacant, though, so I can say that one. Gotcha. Thank you. I'm gonna move straight on to public hearing then. Without a petitioner or staff presentation. This is an opportunity for persons to speak up to three minutes about this item. We will first call on individuals present to address the commission. The remote participants to speak during this public hearing remotely, please press star nine if listening by phone or use a raised hand feature of viewing through the web link and for phone access, please call 877-853-5247 and enter meeting id 900 776-634-1226 City staff will select callers that have raised their hand using the last three phone number or by name.

Proposed motion move by Commissioner Mill seconded by Commissioner Weich. Discussion Commissioner Hammerschmitt, thank you. Okay, so for this one, you said there are no plans to. Okay, then why annex it? The school district purchased the property just on Ellsworth. And so this intermediate parcel connects the existing Bryant school parcel with the parcel on Ellsworth. So in our capital program, we do have plans to come back to Bryant, I think, in 2034 or beyond. And so having the ability to access utilities in this area would allow for consideration in a more central site and a contiguous sort of set of property versus that was basically an island between two properties, city, townships, city. And now it's all okay. Thank you. Great. Any other commissioner comments? Commissioner Mills. And so, to be clear, you do own this and you have owned it for some time? Yes. Okay. Got it. That clarifies much. Thanks. It had sat as a field for a very long time adjacent to Bryant school. And there's really no, and no need to annex that parcel for a long time until we purchase the property just to the south along Ellsworth. And then all of a sudden, we needed to consider. Thank you. Any other commissioners seeing? None. I'm going to move this the vote and I will read the proposed motion once again.

Have a good evening. We're going to move on to section ten a, which is other business. This is a 601 Mary court pre Pud conference checklist. As noted before, there is no public hearing on this. This is a pre Pud conference. The proposed project site includes four parcels on the north side side of Mary Court, bounded by Mary street to the west and a public alley to the east. The four existing lots each contain one single family home. The four lots will be combined into 18190 square foot parcel. That's 8190 combined site plan. The combined site is planned for rezoning to a Pud plan unit development for a multifamily residential building. Surrounding uses include multi family residential to the north and west, commercial areas to the east, and the University of Michigan buildings to the south. The proposed housing development would target student tenants. The proposed three story buildings would feature eight four bedroom units of 16 12 sqft each and a total of 12,896 floor area.

I believe this is going to move forward with petitioner presence presentation. Welcome. Thank you. My name is David Lewis. I'm with Lewis Greenspoon architects, 440 South Main Street, Ann Arbor. And this is Brad Wilkinson. Hello, I'm Brad Wilkinson. I'm the developer. Thank you. Welcome. See those mouse is working. I'm going to do a quick presentation with some first kind of orientation of the neighborhood we're developing in. This is the John F. Lawrence edition that was established in 1890, and it's basically bound by Hoover Avenue in the south division on the west, Hill street on the north and State street to the east, with Packard kind of slicing the corner a little bit. This neighborhood is, is, I believe, completely student rental properties. There's a mix of single family homes, duplexes, and apartment buildings. I believe most of the apartment buildings are in the twelve to 18 unit neighborhood, typically two or three stories. There is, as I imagine myself, you know, already on the other side of Hoover are some athletic facilities of University of Michigan. Packard and State street have a lot of commercial and retail buildings. And then there is a. This is Mary street, and our project is on Mary Court here. And then there's an alley, and then just zooming in a little bit, Mary Court is a private street that was created back in 1916. The developer's desire and vision for this development is to maintain and improve Mary court and try and balance increase in density without kind of destroying the character of Mary Court, and also a strong desire to build something that kind of fits in the neighborhood. So we've come up with this concept of eight townhomes in a single building, four bedrooms per unit. This basically doubles the existing density. Right now there's four single family homes with four bedrooms each. So there's 16 bedrooms, and we'll be building 32. The new construction is going to extremely outperform the existing buildings that are there. Now we are going to do a thermal envelope for the new building that's above code, minimum energy, star appliances, high efficiency h vac, and then also a pretty elaborate stormwater system similar to chick fil a. The soil isn't good for infiltration, so we're having to do a pretty significant system of stormwater, but it's going to be. Right now, there's nothing on the property that addresses of stormwater at all. So overall, I feel like there's a significant improvement to the impact on the environment and the carbon footprint of the building compared to simply fixing up the old homes that are there versus what we would get in new construction. Let me move on to the actual project. This is a rendering. Let me go up to full screen. Perfect. Here's a rendering of the proposed eight townhomes with Mary street in the foreground and Mary Courtney here. There is currently a. I was going to show you some photos. There's currently a sidewalk that's kind of in poor condition, that we're going to rebuild something better and nicer. And we're going to be providing some benches for people to sit at and enjoy the open space. And again, the developer feels like currently the existence of Mary court is kind of a special feature. It's not typical in this neighborhood, and he feels really strongly about keeping it and improving it, which I think is a nice amenity for the neighborhood. Here is architectural site plan. On the south side of Mary Court, there are four homes that are remaining. And you can see here the walkway. Every unit will have a front porch. There will be a walkway with some steps up to the front porch, bicycle parking on either end of the court, and a place to store trash and recycling carts in the back. This drawing here, you see the kind of outline of the four homes that are going to be demolished. And this is the exterior elevations of the proposed building, the court elevation, where you have the eight front doors. This is the Mary street elevation. Again, we're trying to kind of blend in with the existing context of two and three story buildings. This is the north elevation. And this is kind of. This is an elevation of Mary street showing the existing two and three story buildings and the proposed new eight townhomes here. And this is Hoover. And then you have the intramural sports building across the street on Hoover. Let me just go back real quick. I was just going to show some photos. I'll start here. This photo in the lower left is kind of looking down Mary street, looking south toward the intramural sports building at U of M. And again, you can see kind of typical two and three story buildings in the neighborhood. This is looking north on Mary street. This is the corner of the property in question. This house had a pretty significant addition done to it at some point, basically making this a three story building. Down Mary street, there's a new, I believe this is a duplex. And this is a view of the alley looking with the property on the left. And this is a large apartment building on facing State street across the alley.

So I think it's going to, we're going to kind of take the best of what Mary Court has now and keep the best parts and make everything else better. Let me go back to. I don't know if you have anything to add, Brad. No, but ready for comments and questions. Thank you. And then I believe there's also a staff presentation. We do have a couple comments to add, of course. So really, in any PUD analysis, we look first at kind of, can it fit any other zoning districts? Puds should be a last resort. We don't want to default to those, of course. So in this case, really, the most comparable district would be the r four e. As far as a multifamily, the density complies. However, the project is unique in that the lot size doesn't really comply to any of our districts other than the smallest single family district. It doesn't conform to r four c even as a total. If you take the entire building area, combining all those lots doesn't quite even meet a legal r four c parcel. So again, with the problem with fitting in any zoning districts is while the density does comply with an r four e, as I noted, the setbacks do not because they addition. Well, actually, you just look at the way the site Mary court is not a public street, so that's not truly a front. They have their front along Mary. And then the rear is to the alley with an r four e. The rear setback, it's about 30ft, actually would be the minimum required. It may be larger based on the length of the building. We do have additional setback requirements for that. The same with the side. The side setback to the north. So the left, basically, if you're looking at the structure right there, it's set back to the left. That would be the required one to the north would be what's at least 10ft is what would be required. I'm trying to look at what our actual requirement here. There is an additional setback. Yeah, it would turn out to be 16. Okay. With the additional. Given the length of the building. Okay, thank you. So again, given the length of the building, the additional setbacks that pushes that setback to 16ft and the 30 for the rear. So those are like, again, the setback issues that the project does not comply with, as well as a minimum lot size. As I said, r four e at minimum is 14,000 sqft. But again, even if you look to an r four c, that's 8500 sqft project, the parcel doesn't even meet that. As far as affordable housing. Affordable housing, as many of you know, is required in many puds that exceed the residential density of the highest residential density possible under the master plan, as well as like existing zoning. We look to four reals. Multifamily is what the property is zoned. The most intense r four e. The density is 75, I believe, units per acre. And so again, it does not exceed that. So affordable housing would not be required as part of this petition. I think it kind of summarizes up most, most of, again, while, you know, staff was supportive of the additional density, we were looking to the petitioner challenging more on other public benefits or looking to the planning commission to possibly expand upon that issue as well. And I'm here for any questions. Perfect. Thank you, Mister Kowalski. And anything to add? All right, perfect. I just saw that the staff presentation was also planner Helen corporate, so. All right, great. With that, we're going to go straight into discussion. This doesn't have a public comment component to it, so does any commissioner want to kick us off? Commissioner Weatherby. Okay, so this is a place I feel quite strongly about, just because these courts are amazing and I think they're such a cool part of the downtown areas and there's a few scattered here and there. So when I saw this come up and this, this is one I lived not too far from here and until recently voted at the Mary street polling place, which was right across the street. And so when this came up, I was like, oh, well, there goes the court. And then it was like, oh, yay, the court is still there. Which I think is awesome. It's great. I think for me, my hesitation is that I wish there was more. I wish that I live in a house similar to these houses. Tearing these houses down for just double. That doesn't seem like quite enough to me. There's not much sustainability features. There's not. It just. It falls a little bit short for me. But I also think it's awesome. So it's kind of a. It's a. It's an uncomfortable spot for me because I wish that I could say, oh, this is just fabulous. And I love that you're keeping the court. That is, I think, really great. I think there are some things like the porch is great because that's a big important part of that court. Are they going to be like porches where you can put chairs or a hammock? Or are they going to be livable porches? Or are they just porchlets? They're 6ft deep, which is enough for chairs.

You wouldn't be able to have a dining table necessarily, but definitely room for chairs and a little table for drinks or something. Iced tea or something. Iced tea, definitely. So some of the things. So that's good. I did have some things that would help me are like accessibility. You talk about the couple steps up to the porch. It would be nice if we talk a lot about students, but there are students with disabilities who need mobility aids, and they also deserve to live in, often live in new spaces because the old ones are not very accessible. It would be nice if maybe one or two of the units could be fully accessible. Sustainability, things like rooftop solar. We talked about a lot of things about rooftop solar, and there's not, it's got good south facing there. I mean, there's not much in the way at this point. Things like class A bike parking. I don't know if bike parking were just going to put some bike hoops, but something that's a little more robust, that is because it is very much not car centric. And I think it would be great to really promote that and improve upon that. So I think those are some things that just off the bat, I am thinking about. Those are my thoughts. So great. Thank you. Thank you. Who'd like to go next? Commissioner Mills. Thanks. Similarly, I was curious about what this was going to be, and I think that this is very much like keeping the character and meeting kind of the intent for this area in terms of additional. Well, the fact that it's multifamily units and that's what kind of we're envisioning for this area. So I think that that is really beneficial. I think that the analysis that staff did in terms of doing the comparison and just understanding, like, what the conflicting land use buffer requirements have and some of the other setbacks to me make the case that the only way that we would be able to develop to what our density is is either this or through further lock combinations, which are going to lose that character. So I feel like this is the place where it seems like, yes, we don't have a district. We don't have any one zoning classification that would allow for this, which I do think makes a whole lot of sense there. One of the lesser known things in terms of public benefits. I'm with you. And thinking about sustainability, I think making those porches usable really important. I think your comparison on height is really useful in the context of it. Also, all of those places. Ultimately, the comprehensive plan is calling for increased density in this entire area. So I would be okay with starting the trend of another floor. I think that that's not a bad thing. It wouldn't be wildly out of character. It's not like, again, I don't know what the stair requirements are and all of that kind of stuff that we talked about the last time, so. But I think that the idea of like, four stories here. Not crazy. In terms of the public benefits, one of the things that. And this is more of a question for staff, potentially. This is currently zoned r four C. Correct. And one of the weird things in our code that I know because I also live in an r four C district in a non conforming lot. And this is for people who want to follow along page 254 of the UDC. If you're in an r four C district and you don't have a big enough lot, you can have a single family home. So, like, that's the only thing that's developable here. But then you still have to follow the setback, placement and height standards of the r one C district. And so that still requires, like, significant, like, setbacks. And, like, the public benefit, in my mind, is getting some of the stormwater mitigation benefits. There's nothing. There's really nothing, no other way to develop this site. Like, you can either just perpetually remodel those units, but then you're not going to be able to achieve the density or do single family homes, but even then they're going to be only smaller because then you have to comply, actually, with the setbacks. That is correct. Yep. You are correct. So if you want to do new development to get more benefits, single family home, you can put up a single family home, but those single family homes then have to comply with the setbacks of the r one c, which would not allow them to be as close together as what the current ones are. So this, again, I think that that's a benefit. Effectively bringing the site's stormwater up to modern standards is a public benefit that I think that we could take in this. And I don't often say because this is really, like a weirdest and the kindest word, like, funky kind of set of site conditions. So I would encourage, like, the more that you can do on sustainability, again, making this, making this an amazing court for the next century with building stock that is preparing us for the next century, I think, would be huge public benefit and really, really encourage that.

I would also suggest that, I think using the stormwater stuff as one of your public benefits, because we can't get that otherwise without gigantic lock combinations. And that would be a significantly different character to that specifically on that court. Thank you. Any other commissioners with comments? Oh, councilmember Dish. I'm really grateful to my colleagues for going first and saying all those incredibly good and detailed things. So I'm looking at the things that I don't think we need to discuss really anymore. The justification for going with a pud here, because you are doing something that we want, which is you are making an infill project that increases density, and you are maximizing the use of this strange lot. And we actually don't like big setbacks. So it's kind of. It's good what you're doing. So we're. I think that makes me happy, but I'm looking at what I need to look at. And so innovation in land use and variety and design layout and type of structures that furthers the stated design goals and physical character of the abdominal land use plans and policies. What's nice here, actually, is that I'm not sure if I would count this as an innovation, but you're taking a really unusual place. As you said that, for example, we all feel a bit heart sick over Braun court because it couldn't be built again now, according to our standards, for the same reason that we're looking here. And it's probably not going to be developed in the. It'll be developed with greater, excuse me, density and disruption to that. And so you're doing something here that is neat. You're preserving a form of. It probably was worker housing when it was built. And so I guess it's innovative not to just be, you know, putting a block in there. So economy and efficiency of land use, natural resources, energy. So, yeah, the stormwater, water can go there. The fact that you're maximizing the lot provision of open space. So here you're not doing that. You can't really do that. But you're putting grass where it looks like. I don't know. Either there's gravel now or really compacted dirt. But I am wondering if it would. I don't know which would be better. And people should weigh in on this, whether we like more grass or whether we'd like a bigger porch. You know, it might be. Well, you can't. One issue is that the city required, the engineering department requires a 30 foot sewer easement. There's utilities running through. Yeah, so there's. So we actually. One of the initial hurdles we kind of dealt with in the design of this was getting the porches out of the easement, the 30 foot wide easement, because right now there's a 24 foot sewer easement. And we were hoping. The planning department said they were fine with us sticking to the 24 foot utility easement, but they said it's really the engineering department's call and we tried really hard in the engineering department to let us stick with the 24 and they said absolutely not. Okay. Okay. Understood. It's frustrating because I don't think the 30ft is. To me, 30ft seems excessive. Yeah, we hear that a lot. I would love to be able to stick with the existing 24 foot easement and that would really give us a lot more flexibility. Yep. Okay. So then I want a second commissioner Weatherby's suggestion that you consider making one or possibly two, although that's half of the units fully accessible. So losing those steps, you know, making a. Or again, you can't because that makes it too steep. Well, the other issue is the bedrooms are all upstairs and you're not going to put it in an elevator. Right. So that's one reason the building code allows this. If you have a traditional apartment tower with an elevator and flats, you have to have a certain number that are accessible. When you have townhomes and there's no bedrooms on the entry floor, you're not required to provide any accessible. And it would be an extreme solution to put in a lift inside the unit. Right. Understood. And these units are. The footprints are pretty small and to put a bedroom on the first floor would really make it not work. Right. Okay. It's good to have these details about our requirements. Not all of us who sit on this board know them as well as we might in another four years. So I guess. I guess what I would like to ask you to consider some things that wouldn't be very costly. I don't think so. The first thing would be that when you take these houses down, that you work with habitat for Humanity to salvage as much as can be salvaged. And they would probably need to come in and assess before you rip down to say what is there of value? And then they would probably need to strip it or be there when you start to deconstruct so that they can take the stuff because there probably isn't much room for on site sorting. And once you take something down, driving it to a sorting facility, a lot of the materials that could be useful get damaged in that process.

Are you saying that they would bring a truck and we would put the existing stoves and washers and dryers and appliances like that on their truck, offer them parts of the guts of these houses to put on their truck and just coordinate that with them? I think that's how it works. So we do not have in Ann Arbor a construction or deconstruction ordinance yet, but habitat does do that. Kind of thing. And I don't know if they would want the appliances. I don't know how old they are and how efficient they are, but sometimes they want building materials, sometimes, you know, there could be, because these are single family homes, they might be completely trashed. There might be nothing of value in them. But habitat could come and say to you, oh, we could use this and that, and then they could take it. That would be super. It might take an extra day. I know it's much easier to just whack something down. But that would be, that would be great if you would consider talking to them about the logistics and they may tell you, oh, no, no, no. We really, we're not equipped to do that. But my understanding is that they sometimes do do that. And so it would be great if you could do that. Another thing would be exploring the possibility of offering compost and recycling for your residents here. Because you could do it with carts. You could do it with rolling carts. There is recycling. Good. Well, already happening. Explore the possibility. I've heard the city is planning on providing compost posting in this neighborhood. It's on their to do list. Matt might know more about than I do, but actually, I do. But the waste management person, I forget his name, told me that it was, you know, there's certain neighborhoods that have composting cards now and certain neighborhoods that don't. This is one neighborhood that doesn't. Doesn't yet, but they plan on providing that in the future. And it wasn't. He didn't know whether it was like a year away or five years away, but it was on their list. Okay. Yeah. That's too bad that it doesn't already. So we have a dedicated spot for the trash on the east side of the building. So it's going to be a little more organized for a trash area. When we think of composting, we think of students and how disciplined they might be in putting the compost in the right spots to avoid. Thank you. You want a bin? I mean, so we're all about composting, but we just, we think of what lifestyles are like and we worry about composting. So I think probably the best solution now would be if you're going to have a trash area, save space for one or two rolling carts for compost, because that is how you would accomplish. Compost here is just the way any single family home does, is through a rolling cart. So it would be closed. It would be clear, you know, and it's not provided now, but it is projected it will be difficult if you don't project space for that now. It would be difficult to make space for it. The students are interested in these things. If they had a composting, a real composting bucket accessible in their home, that they might use it properly. Yeah. And they'll buy that themselves. I mean, you don't have to provide them with countertop compost, but, yeah, I think they would. I mean, there's more, and they're doing it. We're doing it on campus. All over the place, there's compost, and they know how to throw organic matter into it. So in their own house. So for you, I think at this stage, it's simply a matter of just creating space for that in your trash area and maybe talking. Having a chat again with the solid waste area folks. Jenny Pitoski often is the person coordinating these services. She could tell you how many bins you might need. I wouldn't think it's more than two. It might not even be more than one. Yeah, yeah. Probably not more than one, right? No, they're not. There is definitely not. So those things would be super helpful. And then I just wonder if you want to say a little bit more about how you thought electric could be accomplished without, you know. Yes. In order. Order to keep the costs reasonable for. I don't know if I jumped the cue, too, but if you need more on what we say when we mean all electric. Right. Like, generally speaking, students aren't, like, they have to have their gas stove. So, like, electric burner is totally. But I think that in this, like, it's space heating. That would be the thing. And the fact that you have attached units should be very. It's doable. And again, there's a part of the energy policies that are now in place. There's a whole lot more research on cold weather. Heat pumps like that work in this climate again already. It's possible. Like. But in case, like, sometimes there's an education gap between. When you're talking to your h vac contractor about that, again, I see that would be a huge benefit and able to show that this is the public benefit in making this possible for the future. So I.

But I think that there's little reason why you couldn't electrify the heating here especially, and you don't have so many units that there should be a limitation on the grid I'm imagining, but I don't. This is one of the things that you need to plan for when you're kind of thinking about that, but you're gonna, you know, you need a bigger service anyway because you've got not four units anymore. More. Right. So that's what you meant by kind of being clear about what I meant by electrification. Thank you. Any other commissioners with comments? Commissioner Weich? So, one, thanks for bringing this to us. Two, thanks for doubling the density for r four c to what this pud is going to be. I want to echo my colleagues, Commissioner Mills, and say, let's go four stories. That would be my recommendation here. I don't think it changes too much in the neighborhood in terms of the character of it. And then rooftop solar, which we've talked about. I think it would be worthwhile exploring whether you could do a corner unit that does have an accessible one to meet the sort of requirements for the pudding. And then I have questions for staff that I can ask now, or I can ask during commissioner proposed business, because this is another r four e potential that we can't do because of. Wait, let me get it. Table seven or 517. Three. And the footnotes a, b and d in this case, because it's the height, it's the length of the building, and there's parking that's in there, and it's like, can we just strike these? So that, because this feels onerous to have to do this pud, but given the minimum lot size, do we actually have options where we can say, I agree that it's so complicated, it does need its own pud, but it feels like we have something that's close enough, but then we have all these restrictions because of the setback, and we are the body. Right. So we could propose to get rid of these. Yeah. Yes. I mean, that would take a longer process, of course, but yes, we can't do that necessarily. Right. Here's the second one. But you're correct, and very similar the last week or month, whatever it was, that the 1146 south maple pud. Again, that was a setback issue as well, because of the additional length and height of the building. Those are kind of remnants of our older planning codes where again, where the conflicting land use buffers came out. We've separating things. We want more setbacks. It may be worth it, but again, that commission has to correct ultimately council something onerous on for us to put this all on you when the things that you are proposing are the things that we want, but the code won't allow you to actually do it even though we want it. And it's our intention to have the buildings closer to the road to maximize the density, especially in this area, as the land use says, and to achieve some of these goals. But our planning documents are behind our intention and our desires. And so sorry you have to go through this. So come back with another story. Put some solar in. Consider an accessibility unit maybe on a corner as a way to achieve some of the PUD requirements because it does actually require that you meet certain community benefits. And so we'll need to articulate that. I think the stormwater is one, as commissioner Mills or others have already articulated, that you should highlight, given that there's none that's there, and then see if you can do something with those porches, maybe structure them in such a way that they could be hammock ready or something along those lines. I'm just reaching here because I would want this to be easier, but it's not Mex Kelly to that point. These are not forgotten items, not only brought up in the context of an eventual item in your work program, but I think you may recall from our meeting on May 7 that these are in a special group that is being tackled through the comprehensive plan. Actually, planner Kowalski and I were in some working groups just last week related to simplification concepts for our zoning district, which will be discussed soon, maybe as soon as, I'm not sure the agenda yet for next Tuesday, but I would encourage those who feel sympathetic to this and would really like to see changes to lot sizes or setbacks to ask about that particular item during the subcommittee meeting and to look for. All of the steering committee meetings have now been made into public Zoom meetings, so please look for these items to come through the comprehensive plan process.

Actually, planner Kowalski and I were in some working groups just last week related to simplification concepts for our zoning district, which will be discussed soon, maybe as soon as, I'm not sure the agenda yet for next Tuesday, but I would encourage those who feel sympathetic to this and would really like to see changes to lot sizes or setbacks to ask about that particular item during the subcommittee meeting and to look for. All of the steering committee meetings have now been made into public Zoom meetings, so please look for these items to come through the comprehensive plan process. They are actively being workshopped. I just wanted to mention that they're not on an eventual list. They have active attention being given to them right now. Thank you, Commissioner Adams. I'll try to make my comments brief because I think they're probably going to be unhelpful to you and you should probably ignore them, unlike some of my other commissioners. One of the things I kept thinking about as we're going through, and I'm listening to the comments about solar and electric and heat pumps and layering on all these sustainability elements. I actually think your project as proposed probably complies and is approvable as a pud. And we have a project going in across the street, across State street that's going to be much taller. I'm guessing more expensive. That's just a guess. I'm not an expert in how these things are priced. I'm thinking about this project as a market rate project that could fill a different price point in the market right across the street. Different type of building, different location, maybe a different type of student renter. And what I would hate to do is layer on so many sustainability elements to it to get it through this process that it becomes not equivalently expensive, but less affordable. Affordability is also part of the calculus here. So we don't have affordability requirements that apply. I can't get that affordability by law. So I'd hate to lose incrementally as we tack on. I mean, I'm one vote, right? You get my vote without adding the additional things, you might not get some other votes on the table. That's why I'm telling you. You might want to ignore what I'm saying, but my own perspective on this is that I'd like to see a balance, but I don't. I don't want to see a project come back that won't do that. Right. Because then I've got that. Across the street, I might have some very high end apartments and some affordability and some sustainability and all those things. The kitchen sinks across the street. Maybe this project is different and maybe that's okay. Good. I appreciate that. Thank you, Commissioner Hammerschmitt. I'm kind of glad you talked before I talked. I think that's a really interesting point. So I also. I really like this project. I don't. I wish you didn't have to come for pud. Like, I wish this was going to be hard. We are looking for some sort of public benefit, I guess. I would like to see you. And I was going to harp on the solar and investigate geothermal and make it all electric. I mean, even if you could investigate it and come back to us and let us know the financial feasibility to Commissioner Adams Point, if that would kill the project and make these rents so exorbitantly expensive that it's not helping the students in the city that need places to live. Like, we need to understand that. But to Commissioner Bill's point, there are rebates and tax incentives and all of those things for geothermal, for heat pump water heaters, for solar, for battery storage. So I really encourage you to investigate that because I do think that would help push this a little bit more. The public benefits, these are really narrow units. You know, you can't fit an elevator. I think the only way you could do it is like combine two into one because there's just not enough space. But for visitability, I love the front. I love the front porches. I love that. I think it's really going to help maintain this like, sense of community within this court, especially adding double the number of residents. Maybe provide access to a portable ramp or something that people could use if somebody is coming to visit them, like wants to be able to access the house because it's only a couple of steps and you don't need a very long ramp for that. Yeah, I mean, I really like this. I don't think the extra floor, I mean, that's just more stairs for people to go up to have to access their bedrooms. You guys probably understand the market better if six bedrooms would rent as easily as four bedrooms. I don't know. I think it's good as is. I'm sorry you have to try to find more public benefits, but just really investigate some of these energy efficiency, electrification, sustainability measures as you continue forth in this process. Thank you. I love the design, too. I love the layout. I love everything. Thank you. Yeah. Can I just add one other item? And it may be relevant at this point because it seems like commission is going in a certain direction.

And our nonconforming language specifically states that you can't do anything to alter or prolong the life of a nonconforming structure.

You certainly can't add on. They're small. I mean, the locks, there's nowhere to go. So. But interior, a lot of the other issues would trigger zoning board of appeals, which again, is a process they may or may not get approved. Got it. Understood. On behalf of staff in the department, I also just want to point out that John Barrett, our zoning coordinator, is actively working on updating or non conforming sections of the UDC. So, again, this is not something where we're throwing our hands up in the air. There's active work behind the scenes. It just takes some time. Thank you. Any other commissioners with comments? Does the petitioner think they have sufficient feedback from the commission at this point? Yeah, I feel like we got really good feedback tonight. I appreciate it. If you have any other comments. No, thank you. Got it. Well, no, I appreciate everyone's comments. I will just add one thing would be the visitability component. If you couldn't necessarily do Ada, but having restrooms on the first floor that's accessible with sufficient turning radius, handlebars, etcetera, that provides, at least in heaven, they might not be able to live there. Right. Because the bedrooms on the second floor. But they can come over at least. Right. Or having, you know, closer access for whether it's a stroller with a baby or something along those lines. So I don't know exactly how that layouts. But do you guys have restrooms on that first floor? No, we don't have. The powder room is in the basement. Gotcha. And these units are very, very tiny. And, yeah, there wasn't even space for the powder room on the first floor. Gotcha. It is a unique constrained site, so we certainly understand that. Again, innovation in land use, land use efficiency. We've covered a lot of these items, but looking at the land use settlement of 2009, the master plan does call for, you know, multiple family. I think we also had mentioned that there's a big, what, 17 story, I think that was 1715, possibly going in. So. And all those units are going to be visitable and a decent percent will be Ada compliant. Yeah. And I'll just echo some of the comments saying that four stories really isn't out of the question. It's not, you know, 918, I think, State street, just kind of in that alleyway is also four stories as well. But again, incremental change. And then. Yeah, I will. Hopefully this is enough. Sufficient feedback for the group. Yeah. Right. If anyone thinks of anything, just send over your ideas. Yeah, sounds like a plan. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you. Oh, wait. Councilmember day. Had you thought of four stories or were there. Is there a reason you didn't? Yeah, and I think it was more about. We did think about it, and it was combination of four stories would basically be a six bedroom unit. And there's some desirability, from a renting point of view, to rent four bedrooms easier than six bedrooms. And also the scale, it just felt like the court structure I kind of appreciate, and I think it was Sarah's comment that a lot of these existing structures that are there now are going to be gone in the next 20 years. So maybe being contextual with what's there now is questionable, but we felt like we definitely want to be contextual. And four stories just felt like kind of crossing the line a little bit because nothing really is four stories right around there. Got it. I tend to agree with you, just having been there in court, so. And walking by court. No, I've been to a few. Yeah, yeah. Composting. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah, yeah. I see. Yeah, yeah, sure. Passing by on my way to the IM building to play squash. So let me clarify that. And so, no, just, yeah, four stories relative to the overall dimensions kind of does make sense. So overall seems to be in support. But that being said, please do be mindful that this is going to last, you know, 100 years. Right. And so looking to the future to say, hey, what is a sustainable future? And really looking at, you know, seriously, some of the sustainability components of, you know. Yeah, true renewable.

Again, there seems, this question of affordability versus sustainability seems to have arisen in the context of this pre pud discussion, and I think it's a red herring. The, you know, a mini split or VRF high efficiency heat pump is more. It does cost more upfront than a standard gas burning furnace. But remember that the heat pump doubles as an air conditioner as well. It cools the building, so there's no spending on the air conditioner. The solar panels also pay for themselves in a fairly short period of time. Also with the rebates that Commissioner Mills was talking about in terms of lower utility bills, more appealing to renters or to the building owner if they choose to pay the utilities. The real issue, I talked to developers about this stuff, and the real issue to them is not so much the dollar cost, but it's cultural that, you know, the, especially subcontractors don't like to do necessarily work with heat pumps. They're not used to it. Often they will bid them higher than, you know, working with conventional h vac because as a way to, you know, avoid this sort of job. But it's not because it can't be done equally affordably. You know, it's all this other stuff. It's because we're just not used to doing this in southeast Michigan. There's whole regions of the country that where this is absolutely standard, you know, especially along the coasts, including in cold weather areas in the northeast. So, you know, here in Ann Arbor, we have the benefit of people wanting to build here, and we also have a climate action plan that basically says we should, everything should be not just all electric, but net zero energy starting in 2022. So already two years behind that timeline. So this is something that, I mean, we obviously shouldn't coerce people into doing it, but certainly in a pud situation like this, it already has become pretty standard. I mean, and with buildings like the North Maple apartments, which are including affordable housing as well as going all electric and on site solar. So I just hope we don't regress from the standard that we have set, which, you know, as I said in my earlier remarks, is really minimal. I think we should be going for passive house construction and net zero, and that's in the 820 plan. Again, we heard from Tim McDonald at that Joint Energy Commission Planning Commission meeting in September 2022 that this is absolutely compatible with affordability and this can be done, is being done elsewhere. We have to do it here, too. And I guess I have 5 seconds left. So I would just say thank you for all your work. I really appreciate it and have a good night. Thank you. Is there anybody else that would like to speak at this time? Seeing no one else. Do we have any remote callers there? Are currently no remote attendees. All right, thank you. All right. With that, I'm going to close public comment. Moving on to agenda item twelve. Commission proposed business. Is there any commission proposed business? Ms. Kelly, I just had a quick clarification from earlier in the meeting when Mister Bing from Ann Arbor Public Schools stated that they had a site plan in with the city that was not for the properties that were presented today. For example, 28 62 stone school and 38 1 st school don't. However, 2800 stone school does have an in process review. So I think perhaps there was just a point of confusion because the addresses are similar, but it is 2800, Mister Kowalski informs me, is an existing school. Correct. That's the existing school. It's adjacent, but it's to the north. It's a separate parcel. So unless something went awry in our permitting software, the properties that you saw tonight do not have a site plan, unbeknownst to your staff. Thank you. I may miss some things, but I don't hopefully miss that. Thank you, Commissioner Mills. I was going to have commission proposed business about reviewing that when site plans come before us, but I don't need to do that because that is in one of the numbered things from council. So we will get to that. And it actually appears in there a couple of times. But I know occasionally the like legislative agenda does come before us. And I do think that this idea of a single stair access has come up multiple times. And so I don't know when the city council passes that legislative agenda that they give to the lobbyists, but if we can note that, and it doesn't have to, it doesn't go in our work plan. But if you're able to pass that along to the appropriate staff who lead that, that would be as a, as a planning commission thing and let them know that we would be. I would suggest that maybe when they do come up with their legislative agenda, like, I don't think we se", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Ann Arbor Public Schools", "insights": [{"observation": "Ann Arbor Public Schools had a site plan with the city that was not for the properties presented.

So that you can also be seen. That's also yes. Okay. Hi, my name is Debbie Marks, and I've been a vendor at the farmer's market for 33 years. I think the in person meetings are really important. I'm glad we're having this. I hope as we have more and more, there will be more of a turnout. I know that probably wasn't on the agenda, but this must be. And the farmer's market renovation. I'm hoping that the gentlemen that are in charge of the steering committee can come and address us maybe in two months when we have another in person meeting. So that's what I'm pushing for. And thank you. Thank you. Thanks. My name is Christine Shuproy. I'm a vendor at the farmer's market. I know this renovation is going to take place. It seems like a lot of parking is going to be going away. Does anybody know if the city is going to make other accommodations for people coming to the market? I know that they're going to tell us to park in the Ann and Ashley parking lot, but a lot of trucks won't fit in there, and a lot of people that come to get produce are not going to walk that far if they're carrying plants and other things. In the past, I've suggested a shuttle. I'm wondering if anything like that is being considered. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ed Lin. I'm a neighbor. I live in Kerrytown, and I'm at the market quite often. This whole project here that we're talking about, it's interesting because it seems to be about every seven years the market has a let's build something campaign, and we try to build something, and not much happens. But I'm looking at this and saying, one of the lacking elements of the previous let's build something is what do we want the market to look like in 20 years. And it was just, let's build this and then we'll figure that out. And I think it would really behoove us to before we just start building something to replace what we're going to take down, to look at it and say, what is the market going to look like 20 years? When I moved back to town, that was in 2007, on a Saturday in the summer, the sandlot was filled. Fourth street had vendors lined up along the sidewalk. There were vendors out in the plaza. By Detroit in fifth post Covid, there's a lot less traffic, I think would be fair to say, on a Saturday morning during the summer and now losing 50 parking places across the street. And it wasn't that there was lots of parking to begin with. I can walk there, but not everyone can. And so what do people think? It might be helpful to do some scenario planning of, okay, what would happen if the market stayed at its present level? What would happen if it grew somewhat or what would happen if it actually began to shrink? And then how do we do some of this construction that would fit within any of those scenarios and try to lay them out? Because there's lots of construction going on. Carry down. I know that from, and I've only, I've only been there twelve years, but I think it would really be helpful if people, whoever's running this steering committee or whatever, to sit down and say, okay, this is what we're going to try to do, to try to define some scenarios, who we're going to go to see, what is being investigated and how we can participate in. Because the whole process, because this, I think we all will agree, is a very, it's a unique part of Ann Arbor with its mix, commercial, residential, high school right there, Carrytown concert house and whatnot thrown in, we can't really screw this up. So let's try to do it right this time. Okay, thank you. Any other members of the public that would like to speak this time around, you'll have another opportunity towards the end of the meeting as well. All right. All right. Seeing no more comments, we'll move on to the next item, which is item e, approval of the minutes from the previous meetings. We had two minutes to go through from last time, since one of them, we got a little bit later, had a chance to look through those. Any changes, modifications, adjustments. All right, so then I. Is there a movement or is there a motion to approve? What is it? Both? How about we'll do both of them? It seems like if we have no comments on the motion to approve, both of them.

All right, general updates. So, obviously, a large bulk of the conversation will be about the construction project and this. But before that, I just wanted to give some updates because we haven't been able to have a chance in recent meetings. So as you may have noticed, those at market regularly, we have brought on eight new vendors this year. They're a mixture of farms, greenhouses, food producers, and I think that's pretty much the cross section bakeries this year. And we're at the point that we are starting to think that. I think we are full. I don't think we can bring any other people on this year because of the space constraints. Our number as of right now is 125 vendors. That's. I want to say at least five more than last year, about 15 more than right after Covid. So we're. We are growing. I don't really think either. There's been that many retirements over the last year, although there has been shifts in business ownership of certain vendors. But that's sort of where we sit right now. We're kind of just finalizing. There might be, like one or two people that we're still talking to, but we're pretty much about ready to close the door for this year, which is great. But it also does mean, because the construction trailer is in the parking lot, that does cut into about half of the potential sandlot spots we ordinarily would have. So instead of 16 spots, we have eight. So that's another reason why we are thinking. But also last Saturday, we are already at 80 vendors, which is very early in the season to be that full. So that's a good sign for things to come for a very busy season. Partly because the weather's been so mild. We never really had a decrease over the winter. I mean, there was some days where it's a little bit slower, but we've been really, really consistent on traffic since. So that's sort of driving our conversations about, like, yeah, there's some great people that have applied, but we really don't have space comfortably so that everybody can fit. So that is my update about that. I don't know if you add anything to that. Great. We're also getting to be the time of year where our annual status vendors are going to be receiving their invoices. It got a little bit delayed this year because we were investigating whether or not. We could change the invoicing process, whether we could use a program called Civic Rec, which is the same program a lot of park facilities use for rentals and different types of signups, so that we can make it a lot easier. Because in years past, if there's an error with an invoice, we can't fix it. We have to wait for a finance to fix it, and it just makes a lot of confusion for vendors and makes the process a lot more difficult than it needs to be. But because of the construction project that kind of got pushed behind. So we're hoping for next year we'll be able to make that transition and make the invoicing process a lot easier, make it so people can finally pay online and all of these other ways again, edit it in the moment if we need to, not having to wait till the next week for folks that are ready to pay and that sort of thing. We are in the process of finalizing which daily status vendors want to pay yearly. I hope to have that invoice sent out to finance or that spreadsheet rather set to finance within the next week. So. But the June 30 is still the deadline which is outlined in, in market rules. And we were moving forward with that, but the delay was pretty much because we were hoping to streamline it and then it just didn't happen in time. But we are in process for that for next year. So currently they're going to get mailed out like hard copies. Yep. And I think that they at least do a better job now. Like they'll email people a reminder as well. And it's confusing because on the invoice it says you can pay online, but we all know that doesn't work. So that's the main reason too, why we wanted to switch over, make it a lot easier for people. And again, you know, some people are fine with the paying in person and whatever, but just also having that as another option for folks, especially if you're up against a deadline and your staff person forgot to hand in the check or, you know what I mean? Like that. Can I pay one other question. Yeah. Can I pay my stall rent in tokens? Commonly asked question from defenders. The answer is no. As you know, two different funding streams do not cross over. But yes, you threw me off there. Good job. Sorry. Still trying to take notes of facility. Great. But yeah, so coming soon on that and feel free to ask us questions. And the other thing I should say is we can't accept payment without an invoice, which is the other reason why we're trying to streamline this process, which it might seem like, why can't I pay, you know, what I owe the way?

But the finance department will not accept payment without an invoice attached. So that is why. All right, events moving right along. So we have a full event season lined up. We have recently finalized a lot of key details. I hear through the grapevine from Hannah that we actually will have kids activities, specifically story time returning to the market. We had tried to have a version of that last year provided by like a private company that was, did sort of like reading adjacent activities wasn't as successful as we had hoped. But this one, you know, coming soon with more details, that's just a very, very recent development that we have gotten some movement on that flower day is the most, I guess, upcoming event that is on Sunday, May 26. That, of course, is a partnership between the farmers market and the Sunday artisan market. It is very popular. It's been going since at least 2019. We've got a lot of our vendors that are already signed up. I know the artisan market is in prep mode for this as well. We will have live music provided by Blue Sky Jazz during the event. We will have kids activities. We will have prepared food, and we're still just finalizing the very last details, but it should be really similar to years past. So that is coming up very, very soon. Other events that we've been planning and actually executing as well is the cooking demos are back for 2024. We did our first 1 May 8, which was a Wednesday market with Lupe Belasco Ruiz, or, excuse me, Bolanos Ruiz, who is the owner of it, cake salsa. As one of our vendors, we will be having five total, so we've done one already. And then it's going to be on the second Wednesday of the month, June, July, August, and September. This year, we've done it a little differently. In the past, we had partnered with Edible WoW magazine for a lot of different reasons. We decided not to go in that direction this year, partly because with the demolition and renovation project, we weren't sure what the space would look like. But this year also because of that, de emphasizing having chefs come and having it more community based, whether that be vendors, customers, and other members of city staff. On June in the June 1, we actually have a really fun cooking demo coming up with a leva from natural area preservation, and she will be doing a cooking demo with foraged edible plants, including garlic, mustard and other fun stuff. So that will be coming up in June and then we are almost finalized with all the other dates, but stay tuned for more information about that. Those are always popular. Really great. The other big series of events is the food truck rallies. They will be happening again this year. They are after the Wednesday market on the third Wednesday of the month from five to 08:00 p.m. this year we have a range of 15 to 19 trucks and carts per time. We also have live music lined up, and we are still finalizing the details on that. But that again will be July, excuse me, July, August, September and October of those events. Just another few quick summaries. We've been having a lot of live music happening. We had the Daycroft Montessori Kids concert on Wednesday this week, which is very cute. They loved it. We also have partnered with Ann Arbor Summer Festival to offer the community keys project. You might have noticed there's a piano in the market over by the office, and that will be there till June 21. And that is available. Anyone can play it. That's sort of the point, to have it in a public space. And then on set Saturdays, we will be having concerts. We had one last Saturday. We had one on May 1, the first day of Wednesday market. And there's going to be a few more concerts on Saturdays coming up. This Saturday is also street Music day. You might have remembered from last year. There will be a lot of live music happening in and around Carytown, both in the market adjacent to the market and other locations in the immediate vicinity. So that will be happening this week. And then, as usual, we have a lot of community groups lined up for Wednesdays. We have a lot of other fun events happening during market days throughout the season. And, yeah, I don't know if you have any other events that I missed. All right. And I'm sure there will be more that we will add to this as we go on. All right. If there's no comments, questions, let us talk about the facility and repairs, which is sort of a segue, really, into the conversation about the market office building project. So we had tried really hard to get the bird's nest removed this spring before they got too far along. Unfortunately, the timeline on the US moving the office, the demolition prep and all that stuff derailed that. So I just wanted to let folks know, know we did try. It was not for lack of acknowledgement of everyone's comments last year. We know that it is something we want to have addressed, and we hope that now it's something that we can manage moving forward. But we had put in, you know, a request, but then, you know, things happened with the demol", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Farmers Market", "insights": [{"observation": "We will have kids activities, specifically story time returning to the market.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We had tried to have a version of that last year provided by a private company that was, did sort of like reading adjacent activities wasn't as successful as we had hoped.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Flower day is a partnership between the farmers market and the Sunday artisan market.

It just did not happen in time. And now, obviously, there's birds there, so we can't do anything. And with that said, there are some other issues that we know that there are certain gutters that were overflowing of water last Saturday with the huge storms. Park ops has been alerted to those issues. There were specifically three locations of the market that there was gutters that were overflowing. One of them that was overflowing a lot. I was definitely bailing water out of the shettler stall on Saturday morning with the squeegee. But anywho, luckily the rain dissipated. But these are just basic things. So even though we have a big project coming up, we are still acknowledging other repairs, we're still working through other repairs. But if there's anything that you notice that needs attention, just let me know and then we can move on. Stephen, you have a question? Yes, go ahead. I don't know if it broach it, but back to the verbs. Yep, when. Okay, so given that we've missed this, the window for this year. Yes. I think many of us have been graced by their presence here in the last couple of weeks. I'm wondering if, when the next window is. And can we get started on the nets or screens or anything now? So when that window opens, we are ready to go. Rather than trying to catch up, let me pull up the email from the city ornithologist here. I just have to find that. And Hannah, I would say Hannah did a lot of legwork, too, with reconnecting with the ornithologist and getting a lot of this information, which we had connected with her in the past, but really great resource. Thank you. You can keep going. Sorry. No, I just. Oh, no. We should have brought it up before. But, yes, we did get it approved through the city ornithologist. We just had to put the trailer and move everything before. Right. It was not good timing of finally getting connected with everyone here. Can you speak up a little, please? Oh, yeah. I talked to the city ornithologists. We're cool beans to put up the netting when the birds are not there. Did they give you a time? A time. So I'm gonna pull up that email and I will answer that for you in just a second. Sorry. Okay. We missed the window for this year with the moving out. Yeah, I'm sorry about that, but we are working on it. And maybe this fall or winter, I want to say, but I'll confirm in just a second. Yep. And, yeah, a lot of the other issues we've talked about before, our mood point, because a lot of it had to do with the bathrooms, which are now closed. Remember, we had continual plumbing issues, you know, pretty much, I want to say, regularly in the bathroom. So, you know, that's one of the problems that somewhat resolved itself now that we are no longer going to be in that building. With that said, there are portable toilets now on site. They should be getting cleaned twice a week. For some reason, that did not happen before Wednesday market, and they were in a pretty bad state. But we have been working behind the scenes to make sure they are ready to go for Saturday, and this will not happen again. And once we hit July, we will be getting a brand new automated so called throne toilet. The city is getting a few others at other locations, but that will be something that is a very high end portable facility. I guess we could call it self cleaning. It's like plumbing. Yes, there's real plumbing. It's self cleaning. It's gonna be a large upgrade over what we currently have, which is the temporary thing. But once it comes, we'll probably have that and another portable, I would imagine, due to just, you know, need in terms of how many people use the space. But as of right now, there's that option. And then also, of course, Carrytown bathrooms are available. So will the. With the twice a week cleaning schedule, will one of those days be after Saturday? Because I had heard that with the artisans market on Sunday that they were in really bad shape. Oh, they were already in poor shape, like, on Saturday, so. And for some reason, there was a disconnect where they didn't know, like, they hadn't communicated with us about the schedule or needing anything from us. And it was basically me having to reach out saying, hey, what happened to them saying, oh, you were supposed to do this, that, or this, but they just didn't communicate. So we're hoping that that will be resolved very, very soon. Is it two times a week? It's supposed to be, yep. And they usually. I mean, I. When we have the bathrooms, I actually coordinate directly, personally with the janitorial staff, so they know the schedule. So they will, once it gets started.

Oh, they were already in poor shape, like, on Saturday, so. And for some reason, there was a disconnect where they didn't know, like, they hadn't communicated with us about the schedule or needing anything from us. And it was basically me having to reach out saying, hey, what happened to them saying, oh, you were supposed to do this, that, or this, but they just didn't communicate. So we're hoping that that will be resolved very, very soon. Is it two times a week? It's supposed to be, yep. And they usually. I mean, I.

With the city ornithologists on when exactly we can put them up now that we missed the little window here. And if they need help, I'll. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. All right, so we can move on then to the market. Office building project updates. So, as you see, you have an faq right in front of you. This is brand new. Ready for this meeting. We are having a mass printing, so we will be able to hand these out to customers and other people that would like them as needed. This comes from a collaborative between ourselves, Hannah and I, the park planners, our supervisors, and other people. And this comes out of conversations that, of course, you know, we're getting a lot of questions and have been getting a lot of questions for months, but we wanted something to streamline and we have had other items. Right. We do already have a card that has a website and QR code that people can go to and sign up for updates. We did have the demolition project signs made that are posted on the office building itself. We also have brand new signs that we started putting up on Wednesday that explain where the token window is, where the bathrooms are. You know, all of the things, in addition, that the office building is now closed. We are just in the process of putting those all up, but they're partially up as of right now. The delay on that has been being short staffed last Saturday and just regular market stuff, so coming soon with a lot of the signage. And again, that was a collaborative between ourselves and the park planners specifically. Lori and Adam are the ones that have been working with us on this, and they've been. You are great. They've been a great resource. They are pulled in many different directions. They have a ton of other projects, unfortunately, at the same exact time, but they're putting in a ton of hours, a ton of effort in on this project, so. And again, they're very sad that they had to miss today. They wanted to be here, but Adam's son has been ill and he is out of town dealing with that right now. So they do. They are aware and they want it to be here. I will also say that we meet weekly with them now, so they are very involved. I know there's a little mistrust of construction projects. I totally understand that. But I think since we do have to actually demo this one, they will be build us something else. So they're very cool people. So I think it will be. Yes, they're not disappearing just because they're not here today. Yes. Okay, so other updates. So, as you've noticed is we are now in a construction trailer. We will be there for the duration, most likely until the building is replaced. There's been a lot of questions about the placement location of the trailer, because where it is right now, as we said, it sort of disrupts our overflow for people in the sand lot. It disrupts our access for some food trucks. So originally, they were thinking, once they demolish the building, then they'll move us over and then move us again when it's gonna be constructed. When we thought, you know, that doesn't make sense. We don't want to move three times. We're just gonna stay where we are until it's done. It makes the most sense because in that way, too, they would have to relay all of the fiber optic, they would have to relay all the electrical, all of the things that they already did to get us set up. It just didn't really make sense to move back and forth. So what we will do is, once the building is demolished, if we need to, we will put stalls on that area instead of where the trailer is. So we will just switch over and, you know, we'll just pivot. Obviously, we're not gonna be able to put a food truck on there, but that's fine. We'll just have to make do. And that's totally okay, because that's really just an add on to our market days anyway. So that is sort of like a big piece of what had changed from when we had originally talked to them about the moving and the moving and the moving, but that is now longer happening. The other item that is slightly shifted is, I know they had originally wanted the demolition to occur in July, but unfortunately, the first bid out, we had no takers. And they think it is because it's such a small project. So they are going to bundle it with a different city demolition project upcoming, and they're hoping that they will get bids with that so that this would probably go forward late summer fall time. So again, that was not their timeline. That was the lack of people available to bid on the project, to be able to complete the project. That was not, you know, a change in their timeline. Just wanted to clarify that. So those are sort of like the big overview things. I did also want to discuss and remind folks that there is going to be a full community engagement.

So a lot of stuff that you raised, Ed, in terms of wanting to have a bigger process, wanting things to be more holistic. That is actually going to happen. That's part of the plan. It's just that because of this issue, we had to close it first, then sort of reassess, because it was an emergency situation that was endangering staff and vendors if we were to keep it open any longer than May 1, which is why we closed that date. So. And there's more information on that on the last of the faqs as well? Yes. So you can turn it over and there's some info, but we can open it up for commission discussion. So for those next steps, is there actually a timeline for getting that engagement? This is just as there will be. Yep. Yep. So Adam is working and Lori are both working on the RFP right now. So they have been gathering information about farmers markets all over the state, farmers markets all over the country, places that have done similar renovation projects, places that have done dissimilar renovation projects. But to see what's out there, to see what other people are doing, I helped give them a lot of cases around here. I know they're looking at, for example, the Flint farmers market. They're looking at Fulton Street, Grand Rapids. They're looking at Eastern Market. They're looking at a couple markets, I believe in Milwaukee, Boston public Market. There's just a lot of things that they're looking at, which, again, they are looking at this with the long view. This isn't just about, let's replace the office and move on. This really is about how do we improve the market, how do we make it even better moving into the future in a way that serves everyone and not just, you know, one group or another, but works for all people at the market. So. Yeah, but we don't know the exact timing because I think it has to do with when the RFP goes out and then because I believe it's like an RFP for a consultant to help facilitate. Okay. The RFP was going out in March, and then consultant would be selected in April or May. So it sounds like that also pushed back the RFP, I think, for building went out. Then when that was not working, that was the one for the timing that shifted things a little bit. So the research that they. They're putting together is to put together an RFP for the firm to do the consulting, correct? Yes. Whereas the one that went up before, just to reiterate what she said, was for the demolition, and they didn't get any takers, so they need to resubmit. Okay. So. All right. Yeah. It was not clear on the notes that's why I'm asking, which are key. It's influx lots of them happening. Yes, it's in flux, but that's the latest that we know as of this very moment. So once that gets rolling, we hope to have our steering committee working with the planners, working with Remy to be able to schedule some community engagement sessions where everyone can show up. I'm not sure exactly what that will look like. If it's going to be like a comment box where people can leave it normally, or if it has to be like a formal meeting or both, I'm not sure what it's going to look like. So I guess the question too is that I've had a lot of people who've come up to me with ideas and things like that. And so is there a way that we as commissioners or we as can PMAC can actually help funnel some of those toward an ear, which is the relevant ear eventually? I just don't think we have that set up yet. I would encourage them to, like, sign up for updates. Yes, good point here. And that will. And that's through the farmers market site. It's through the parks plant. Thank you. There. And then community engagement opportunities should be pushed out through there so they would know when to. So that's not on here, though. Is that there's a QR code for this? It's this one. Well, that's just for the farmers market. Okay, well, then it's all the planning postcard and those giant signs. So if you haven't printed it, this might be a useful thing to include on here, too. Is that that separate, separate card? Okay. And I do already have a bunch of those. Okay. We've already given those out a lot. Might be a combo deal. Great. Yeah. Sorry, I didn't bring those. No, that's fine. That's fine. I just want to make sure because I didn't see it on here. And that's something that's been a common question coming up is like, and if we were hybrid, I would show you on my computer, do you want to share screens? Maybe I just open it around. A lot of people are coming to us with ideas as well. I'm just sending them right now. So right now for updates for us as PMac, should we send them to you guys to get the card or should. What should we do? What would you recommend? Get you there? I would get car or like send them to the planning website. Okay. For the updates. Okay. Would be great. Is it easy for you to email that to us for sure? Exactly. Yes. Do you guys have the postcards in the office. Yeah. Where we can pick them? We do. Great. Exactly.

Yeah, that makes sense. Yes. It actually is a positive comment then, for us because as people who live in the city have been getting, you might have, too, been getting tons of questions. Yes. Oh, yes, yes. And there's clearly a lot of interest, and I make, as been mentioned, too, that this has been an ongoing process for a long, long time and that a lot of people throughout decades have been developing often really good ideas and having. So it seems like if that's, there's one of looking out and seeing what other cities are doing, but then there's, there's been a lot of thought that's what can come in here, and it seems synthesizing those could be helpful. So. Yeah. Right. And don't worry, we have all of those files. Yep. We have a big box in the construction trailer right now. Actually, that's all of the past renovation projects. Oh, interesting. Added to the box recently as well. But yes, they are aware of these fast projects. I just want to clarify, too, a few things that we have heard. One is that this was not anticipated. Right. Unlike those other projects, this was an emergency situation that they had to respond to. And because of that, it's also turned into something broader because it is a real opportunity to sort of also address the hopes that people had, had maybe tied into the previous projects. In 2015 was the big 120 19 prior to the pandemic was a smaller one. But I just did want to clarify that. And there's also been a lot of questions, too, about, you know, the bathrooms being newly renovated. You know, when they decided to fix those bathrooms. That was in 2018. We found out about the gap in 2023. There was no way of knowing that this was something that would happen. But I know that is feedback that we've received from people being confused as to why this is happening, you know, so soon after, even though it's about, you know, what, two and a half to three years after those were completed. But I just didn't want to asterisk that as well because we've been getting questions. Are there any other things that commissioners would like to know? So asking again about the steering committee sort of thinking about its roles and then the possibility of if there's room for adding another vendor in particular onto the steering committee, because besides Jeb, who's amazing, getting a produce vendor, maybe somebody who has to come in with a big truck, might be useful to have their perspective on the steering committee. Just with the same thing with community engagement. We don't know a timeline. We don't know details yet. But also, you know, you all are part of it. Like, it reports to this body. So if that's helpful. Jeff, did you have a point question? No, sorry. I thought you were going to say something. And then when the demolition happens, whenever that happens, will that. I know you all had to. The electricity had to be wired out to the trailer. Yes. I'm anticipating that there'd be every effort to keep the electricity for the stalls. Oh, yeah. That will not be disrupted. No, that's. The other thing I should say, is that this big project with the demolition is going to have a much bigger impact on staff than it will on the market market itself. Aside from the loss of the restrooms, you know, there should be very seamless transition from. No one should lose electrical. The water is back on. It shouldn't be going anywhere. You know, people that aren't close to that side of the market might not even know that the office is closed. So, yeah, no, no, no. None of that will be disrupted. It was a very close call on the first day. We were racing against time with multiple contractors and people to make sure that we could do tokens. On May 4, we got very close to not being able to provide that service. On that day, we were at market for 8 hours waiting for contractors to show up so that it could turn everything on that they had already wired. So there's been a lot of very stressful near misses behind the scenes going on. But I think the biggest push so far has, you know, we've moved forward with it. The fiber, as I said, has already been moved. It is in a box above carpenter's dolls. So really close to the Detroit street entrance to the market. And, yes, we have been in a lot of conversations with the electrician because we have seen them working on site, but park Ops is also behind the scenes working through moving all the electrical grid, you know, moving the water hookups and all that stuff. But it should not be disruptive to the market at all, other than to staff, to clarify. Yes, but it's been very stressful. I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna pretend it has not been for us. Also, the trailer was not level when they first placed it. They made it a little more level this week. It was sort of like this and like this. All at once. They brought up the one side, but now it's still a little bit side to side. So it's much better. Much better. But it might still be getting fixed.

It's a lot better. No rolling chairs. You would have to hold yourself rolling. Yeah. Boxes. And then the drawer would not stay open. Stay closed. That's so heavy. Anyways. Anyway, so, yes, a lot behind the scenes going on. Another thing I should mention is why is 121 Katherine street on here? We've noticed that a lot of people are very confused. They think that the 121 Catherine project is us. It has something to do with the market. No, not at all. Related 121 Katherine. If you want to learn more, there's the QR code here. There's also a little bit of a blurb, just to clarify, that has 48 parking spots that are being lost for the duration of the project. We are getting 18 of those spots back. They would be underground public parking once it's done, including two electric vehicle charging stations, from what I've been told. But, yes, don't confuse. It's not the same thing. And I know it's just an unfortunate coincidence time wise, it seems like there's so much construction happening, it might seem like we're adding to it, but we don't anticipate any parking spaces in the market being lost. Except for the stall. Jeff. Stall. Excuse me, parking space that has already been lost because of the pod. But because of where we put the construction trailer, we were able to pull it off that we did not lose any more parking spaces. There was an outside chance that we were going to lose up to eight spots, but that is not happening inside the market. So vendors, again, should not be very impacted by that at all. You know, and in terms of 121 Katherine, we think it's actually a fantastic project. It's affordable housing, it's supportive housing. It's desperately needed. And we've been working, trying to get connected with edible Avalon so that we can actually have food assistance connections so that we can bring some of the new residents will be there to the market to utilize our food assistance programs because we do accept five different programs at the market. So we're looking forward to that. Although I know it might be a temporary headache for parking for folks. Yes. So as long as we're talking about, like, surrounding area of the market, parking seems to be something that comes up with almost everything, right? I don't know. I was just a kid. I don't remember if it was something that was actually gonna happen or if it was just something that was just talked about and shot down right away. But there was some talk of over at the school, that green space out there, underground parking going in there. Do you know, have you heard anything about that or. Okay, I can. Yeah, I can look in the files when you got time, look back and see what. Yeah. Because I know that was a big talk for quite a while. Well, they just redid that whole spot, so I would assume if they were going to do it, it maybe would have been done, but I don't know. And that's a little bit hard because that's not run by the city because the public schools is a separate entity. So, you know. Well, they're talking about public parking. The school was going to do public parking, and then I don't know. Right. It's all very unclear. And the other thing I should also mention when we're talking about parking, we've been having a hard time with the developer of 330 Detroit Street. A lot of their staff for the construction has been parking in the lot. The market lot has been parked along Detroit street, even though we asked them not to because it blocks access for vendors to their stalls, both for load in and as well as load out. We are hoping that it's getting closer to a resolution with that, but at least it's something that's in dialogue. But it's been a point of frustration for us also, I will say initially, they had told us they would not be constructing anything on Saturdays. They seem to have changed that approach. So unfortunately, that's another squeeze on the parking, is that they are actually taking customers and vendors spots because they're constructing on Saturdays, you know, and again, I've talked to them. I've sort of pleaded with them to think about, you know, what we had talked about and everything like that. But I just did want folks to know. That's another reason why parking right now is especially seemingly difficult because of the construction crew vehicles for that 330 Detroit street project. And what, do you know what the timeline is for 330? They just said that they're behind sky. That's why they have to work on Saturdays. So I thought that they had originally said 2025. 2025. But I don't. I'm not sure. Yep. I think that that's going to get worse as the project progresses, because you're not going to just have one trade in there. You're going to have plumbers and electricians and finishers and all kinds of different people right. And I would say the Wednesday market last week, not the one this week, they blocked the road on Detroit street with a cement mixer.

And I would say the Wednesday market last week, not the one this week, they blocked the road on Detroit street with a cement mixer. They had blocked it about three different times during the day. And I was obviously very stressed out and talked to them a lot, the developer, and tried to explain. This is why we had multiple pre meetings for months before they even started. There is an agreement. Yeah. And there is an agreement that we came to as well, that it wouldn't be very disruptive. Unfortunately, it doesn't really have teeth. It's sort of vague in terms of enforcement. But at least with the market lot, the upside there is we do have clearly posted signs saying, do not park here on market days, Wednesdays and Saturdays. There was only maybe one or two vehicles this week or yesterday that I had to ask to leave, and they did listen. So at least that is helpful. But the Detroit street still remains a point of contention. And the developer also told me that some of them are parking in the community high lot, the Washtenaw courthouse lot, like the places that we also park as vendors, staff, and customers on Saturdays. So it's a difficult situation. But just. Just so folks know, it's not just 121 Catherine street causing things. It's a bunch of other stuff behind the scenes that folks might not be aware of. And 121 hasn't even started construction. So a little bit. They're doing geothermal drilling. Yeah, but they are when they're really start doing the construction lot for now. Right. And they actually did that project, I will say they did reach out to us and say, hey, can we have eight parking spots in the farmer's market lot? And I was like, no, absolutely not. Maybe when we're not open, but not on a Wednesday, not on a Saturday. And they, you know, they were very receptive. They seem to be really great. We're excited to work with those folks. They seem to be. It's a completely different group of people. And they seem to be really receptive, reaching out to us long before they needed to or anything like that. So 121 Katherine is, I would say, is a positive, although, as I said before, it might be a little bit hard to get used to it. But I think the end result far outweighs the negatives for that. Any other questions? You know, we have been a squeaky wheel at the planning commission meeting, so let us know if you need squeaky wheels there. Yeah. Any other comments or questions about anything related to the project? It could also be about, you know, future visioning. It doesn't just have to be about what's currently in process or the demolition. We could move beyond that if you wanted to talk about that as well. Things you would like to see or not, or if you're not ready for it. Can I add one more? Oh, please do so. During the Mihma conference, we got a free market assessment from the Michigan association of Farmers Markets, and that will be tentatively in. Was it June or July? I think I thought we said August 3. Nevermind August. So that will be coming up to track attendance. Try to tack, not attack. Sorry. Try to track. There it is. The amount of money that people are spending at market on the average market day, and also the amount of money people are spending in the surrounding area on a market day. And we're excited about those statistics for the project to provide evidence for the market being a good thing. Not that we all know it's a good thing. A little more proof. So, yes, that is also coming up and kind of ties in nicely with everything we're already doing. And I should also say, too, we found out yesterday that we've been included in a USDA Farmers market promotion program grant, which will also be another way in which they can track what's going on at the market. The goal of that one is actually to draw more customers down, especially from demographics that we might not be targeting for whatever reason. So that will happen four different dates throughout the season, but they just added it to, added us to it yesterday. So I don't know any more details other than that, but it is a really great tool. And this is a project that's combined through University of Wisconsin Madison as well as Michigan state. So it should be a really great, very robust thing. There's a bunch of other markets participating, and they had a little bit extra funding, so they thought of us. So that's another really great thing that really will build off of Mithma's rapid market assessment as well. So if there's any questions you want us to ask in the surveys, if there's any data you want us to try and track, let us know. Do you have examples of other surveys that have been done so we can get an idea? I can find those for you. Yeah, that'd be great to see that. See what gave us like a draft. They normally do five questions and it's like a dot survey style thing. So that would be great because I think that'll help stimulate some other ideas. And we had one done at some point. Yeah, it was in 2019. Yes. Yep. It was in 2019. And that's the thing is like, that's some great data. But since the pandemic, we really have no idea how many people are attending.

You know, we can ballpark it, but those numbers are pretty meaningless because obviously we have over eight entrances. There's no way that we could sit there with a click, you know, like, there's no way we can track ourselves. So when they come, they do an observation over an hour, and then they have a metric that they use to multiply it to make sure that they have a guesstimate that can work. But a lot of these questions are like, you know, how did you get to the market? Or, or what was your most important reason for coming? And I know they had asked before, like, when you come to this neighborhood, what are you coming to do? And that's how we found out most people were coming to the market if they were in the Carytown area. I remember questions about how much money did you spend? Right. There's things like that. And I think for us too, we were thinking of folding it into this a little bit. So getting people aware, like what would you like to see at the market? Or tapping into visioning about the future as well, beyond just sort of like your basic why are you here? Type questions. So that is something we talked with them, and again, very new. We just had a meeting. Again, was that yesterday or Tuesday with them? We can send those questions and send them for next meeting. We can talk about what we should add because it also be interesting if we could compare to the results from the last one too, to get a sense of direction in terms of that's pre Covid. So that's kind of a different time period, but still, it would be kind of just relatives. Because if we cast the questions wrong, then the results are not compatible. But if we do cast them in a similar way, then they actually are cross compatible. And another thing too, I should mention as sort of related to Mifma as well, is we'll be participating in a training, or I shouldn't say we, I should say I a training in the fall. They last for about a year, which is really trying to increase diversity within markets. There is farmers market coalition published a few years ago, something called the anti racist farmers market toolkit. So we are one of the markets selected to participate in this and to get a lot more tools of how do we, you know, attract a more diverse group of vendors, more diverse group of customers, all of the other things that go along with that. So that is something that will be starting this fall and that is hosted by MIFMA as well. But more info forthcoming on that as well. And if anybody's interested in that toolkit, it's online, you can find it. Yes, there's one question around for quite a while with the updates and how there's been interest for trying to get more funding for the project in terms of. Through grants through, but particularly one of them was through direct public donation. And if there are people who are members of the community of trying to figure out how to have a fundraising capability. And I remember brooch this a lot long, long time ago as to whether it was. And it would seem like because it was oftentimes when we can't do the building, we can't build it how we want because we can't afford it, but we won't ask for the funding because it has to come from a village and that we don't have. Our millage doesn't cover it. But there are many farmers markets which do that through just asking directly the people who come to the market. Ann Arbor is a fairly well off community, and there are people who are willing and able to contribute to that. But the problem that I heard before was just the lack of mechanism, and I'm not sure if that's. I guarantee you that money will still be an issue. And if there is a mechanism that we could start exploring to make that more possible. It's even the basic thing of like, donate a brick to the market, and that it's people get acknowledged some way, just some way of having some connection that it is kind of crazy to have. Like, hey, we can't do that. We can't have nice things because we can't afford it. But there are people who want to. Want to help and support, but there's no mechanism for them to support. So that might be something worth visioning beyond just the. It's important to vision the product, but also envision how we actually get there. And that would be another way that seems like an opportunity which has not really been explored or at least brought up. So that might be something else. I'd like to encourage to get some mechanism for that. Sure. Peter, when we were looking at the open space plan, didn't we see something with parks that there was some structure within city parks that might work for this? There are some, yeah. And different cities are really embraced this a lot, and others have really not. I know at least within the city of Ann Arbor, public schools is very not for a variety of political reasons, social reasons. They're very not that they're taxpayer funded. We're going to pay for taxpayer funded, they're not great, except PTO is there and raise a lot of money. Exactly. And so there are their mechanisms. But, so it's weird.

And so, but parks has, there are certain things like donate a tree, burning a bench kind of thing. So there are some things like that, but they haven't really, I'm not sure. And the market in general has not that there's been very little of the kind of fundraising through the market from customers, people who are supportive of the market. And that, that's seemed like a missed opportunity. And again, other markets, if you look at other markets, there are lots of really, really big fundraising efforts that they have and that really trying to use those funds. But that seems like something, particularly with a large capital expenditure like we're proposing, the scale of what we do will depend on our budget and the budget will depend on how much comes in. So this is something that in some ways has to, the horse that comes before the cart is that we'll define the scale. And so it seems like it's important to get that mechanism at least established or if it's not possible for some reason, I don't know. I don't know why it wouldn't be at least get that answer as to what's going on there. And I will say now that Remy is sort of the overhead supervisor to us. I mean, he's got a lot more experience with grants and capturing money in an alternative way. So I think the answer may be different now than it had been in the past, but I don't know any more specifics beyond that. But I will say I found out today that the resilient food systems infrastructure grant program could actually help fund the market renovation project. It is a pretty quick timeline on this grant. And as I said, I just got an email about this again today, but that is something that could also help bridge the gap. Obviously, it's not in place of your suggestion. It would be in addition to, but more information coming about that. It's just a really quick turnaround and, you know, we'll see. So Katie Armantrout used to help with USDA grants, too. So I'm sure you're talking, talking to her and she might be a good resource to. Well, I think also this is one where Osi might help do some of the legwork. And actually that brings up another question. I saw that Osi just hired, recently hired a food person. Somebody does specifically coordinate sustainable food for them. And I was wondering at on the wish list for PMAC if she could also come join us at some point tabling at Wednesday markets. And we're working with her on local food fest in partnership. And I can. Yeah, certainly ask her to come to a GMAC meeting. That'd be great. End of February or something. Yes. She used to run a farmers. Yeah. Wow. She looks like a great resource. Yeah, we can ask her. We can ask her. And then also working with her on the sustainable business coalition and all sorts of other stuff. So. Yes, I have been working with her pretty much since she started. Maybe I just haven't talked about it here. Yes. Great. This is sort of getting to new business. Make sure. Are there any last questions, comments about the project? This is obviously a continuing conversation. If not, we can move on to the next agenda item. All right, moving on to new business. So it actually builds on this. And I know you guys have been really busy, but I was just thinking about how much I actually use the in reports for just the basic numbers of how much money goes out, food assistance and things like that. And now that you have a little more help and that the trailer's in place, I was just gonna suggest that it might be good to crunch the numbers on 2023. I could tell you it's just about $20,000 less than last year for food assistance is all. Because they changed the daily limit for developed food books. But you've already got the template, if you could. But it's basically $110,000 for food assistance. Yeah. If you can just put some. Even if it's just for us, put some figures together, because I like to see the differences between the snap and the boy, Connie, and things like that. I mean, I've already. I've already. I have had that data for a while, so I will send it to you. Great. And then I just wanted to also acknowledge that. Ask where the bylaws are and the possibility of getting a couple more members on PMAC. You know, it was sitting in the city somewhere. Yep, yep. Still sitting where it was sitting.

So it's not, like, from a lack of a city councilmember wanting to do it? No, no one's, like, vehemently opposed. Very controversial. I thought there was. We do. Yeah, we have them. We just need.

If we're not at the place where we have that, the bids are out for community engagement and stuff like that. I don't know. I don't know how helpful it would be. Yeah, I'm actually going to be gone also on that Thursday. In June. In June. Okay. With our fair, you still can park toward carry town and walk a lot. I mean, but they just closed some many streets, you know. Right. And they start, well, it's not the parking I'm worried about. It's the physically getting here part. For some people, it's on a Thursday. I. Yeah, I know. I could go either way for August in that way. And I see the conflict. It's not ideal in that way because it's going to be hard fair. But how do the other commissioners feel for doing a new in person on August? I'm not afraid of July. You're not afraid of July? I feel like August gets really hard for farmers. It's smacking weekend. We tough out July. So you're saying July? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So it sounds like people are okay with July. Then forget it. Anybody wants to park at my house in a walk with me here? It's a mile. There we go. Okay. So let's tentatively plan on July then. So July 18 in person meeting down, most likely here in the basement in the bowels of city hall. I will just clarify that when we are in this space, we cannot have a hybrid meeting. Just so everyone knows. And what the main. The other chambers is just under construction or something. For how long? I think it's like this week. Oh, this week it's gonna be done or this week? Well, this week it was closed, so we might. Maybe we'll be there. I don't know. I've done. Sir, there are meetings next week. There are up there. Okay. So maybe we'll be able to do. But also it could be used like, that's the other. And it could be closed for another construction or someone else using it. Yeah, but if we reserve early, maybe we can bump the about. They might have already preserved. Duh. Okay. Okay. So, yeah. All right. I will make sure everything on my list. I appreciate your tracking that, too. Thank you. All right. Any other new business? All right, seeing none. Then we'll move on to second round of public commentary on. Come up to the seat so they can hear the microphone. When you were talking about Detroit. 300 Detroit. Okay. I was talking to the guys yesterday. They're going to have a drive through there. And so now that the ground floor is, they can park some. They'll be able to park some vehicles in there. And the underground parking is almost done. So you should talk to them about. Okay. When all the trades show up, when they're building up, get them all to park underground. There is parking for the building there underground. And in that sloped floor close to the restaurant, there's going to be parking spaces in there too. Have the people park there. Free up the sheet. I think it's only 13 spots, but yes, good idea. Okay. I have kind of a silly. And I'll probably get knocked down right away, but I keep thinking about this token vending machine. Okay. Where you have a vending machine that spits out the tokens with your credit card. Office doesn't have to do it. It's right there. Is that an okay idea? Am I onto something? Is that crazy? I mean, I don't know. Anyway, also the parking. Yeah, it's crazy. It's insane. I get there now at a quarter after five, so I can deal with it. It's crazy. I would like to see the city step up and help us out a little bit here. I would love to see free parking for the surrounding area. On Saturdays, it would be abused. Yeah, whatever.

Also, I said this years ago. People that park in the structure, let's invite groups in, athletic clubs, students for fundraisers to carry things to people's vehicles, help with valet shuttle, get some things going where we're just not dependent on that parking because it is more of a challenge every single hour down there. Let me make sure. It's a long time till July. I don't really understand what's taking so long on the adding PMAC members on. I didn't really get that. What's holding that up? But, you know, we really do need to move that forward. This needs to be a bigger entity. Okay. We're kind of important here. Thank you. See you at the market. Thank you. My name is Christine Shipwright. I'm going back to the new restrooms. Well, the restrooms that just got renovated, our big thing is sustainability. Are we going to reuse the fixtures that were in there, the stalls, all of that? Are we going to reinstall the solar array that was on the outside of the building? Just curious about that. When they update the market, will they? And since you said they're working on fiber optics, would they actually upgrade the Wifi, which is just short of abysmal? At the market, everybody's using their phones for taking credit cards. Almost all the students that pass through want to do phone payments, and it just goes around in a circle and around and a circle around in a circle, and we're losing sales because of it. The other thing is parking. There's more building going on. There's parking spaces being taken away. I know that some people from the city are like, oh, I didn't have any problem parking here. Well, that's great. You've come at one in the afternoon, and people are not here as much as they are in the morning. I have suggested this before. A shuttle that will take and just do a loop from the market to the parking ramps so that people can actually have their little shopping carts and they can get on the little trolley or whatever, and it can drop them off at a ramp, and people are far more likely to park in the ramps. If there were a shuttle that assisted them in having to haul the things that they purchased at the market, that's haul any other. I have a question. Are vendors having problems finding places to park, like your truck and things like that? Oh, me? Yeah. Yeah. It's. Well, it's always been a problem. I can't really answer that question because I just kind of am in the. I usually take the truck home if there's nowhere to park it. So I haven't really noticed any problem. Bigger problem. As far as parking goes, I'm more concerned about the customer parking. As far as I'm concerned, it wouldn't hurt my feelings any if there was no vendors allowed to park anywhere on the market. That would be my. I'm kind of being exaggerated, exaggerating a little bit there, but I feel like we're there to make money, we're there to feed our families. And nobody, if nobody parked at the market, then that would be all for customers. The free parking, my grandpa always said, and I totally agree. I see it every Saturday. I watched the meter guy go back and forth writing tickets and I'm like, how many of these people are never going to come back to the market now? Probably. Probably not many of them. But still, why can't we work with somebody and make it to where there's some parking? At one point you had talked to the people at community high when they had those confusing signs. That's right. But I do wonder if there's other opportunities. And I know they're separate entities, but Zingerman's has figured it out so that they can park their trucks at community time. Yeah, no, definitely. And that's the thing is that there we've done historically, this was ten years ago, did a full on parking study with, I think I still have the maps. I think there should be still in the PMAC history of all the like, quantifying all the parking spaces within, I think a one and a half mile radius. And there are lots of little pockets of spots which actually, for vendors in particular that are there, they will accept trucks. There's no restriction, at least on Saturday, know, but they're like random little pockets and. But they're not. They're within, but they're like four blocks away. So it's not too bad, but it's not great. And they're not really that visible. So that that was something working out. It still is something to see what's possible. And community high is an obvious one for making sure that there would be. And I remember hearing that similar discussion too, at some idea of having more under some additional parking thing. That was a long time ago. I don't, obviously hasn't gone forward. It's a challenge. The other thing with it, too is just trying to figure, I know the city of Ann Arbor, their push for that is just trying to figure out how to reduce driving, reducing parking and congestion in general.

We did actually have a program, too at one point about trying to get people to, like, actually have carts, like, well, many farms, markets will sell carts themselves and so that people can walk and encouraging walking in that way. And that kind of works for some, but it's, if you're in Boston, if you're in a big city, that's how you get it. If you're in Ann Arbor, we're still not, we're still not of that culture. It's not that it couldn't. It can work just fine. Just like, what are your expectations? It's not going to Meyer, it's going to. To the farmers market in the city and that you behave differently and that takes some training, that takes a cultural adjustment, and that's a challenge how to effect that. Is there any way we can ask in the surveys that we're going to be doing of the customers, where did you park? How did you get here? I think that that would be huge because it's always blown my mind ever since I was a little kid. I'm like, where, where do all these people come from? Do they all live close enough where they're walking here? Obviously we have some of them, but it's always interesting to me. There's so many people come through there, and most people seem to deal pretty good with it. There's just a few things. Unfortunately, Christine left because I wanted to answer some of her questions. She'll be back. So one of them is the first, easiest one is the wireless. Wireless has already been amplified. They did it in the fall. I don't know if she has been at market really that much after she left for the year it got fixed, they put four new amplifiers on the market space. Initially, they were like, oh, yeah, we figured it out. And then they realized that the trucks were blocking the signal, so then they cranked it up. So now it's much, much better than it ever was before. But, you know, it's, it's wireless, it's fickle. That's unfortunately what the technology is at the current moment in an urban space. But yes, they definitely improved that and it has been wonderful to work with. They are the MVP with this whole project in terms of laying the fiber, redoing all of our wiring, making sure we were hardwired and had wireless capabilities. And, you know, they've been a joy to work with comparatively to other folks as well. I also did want to say that they do plan on reusing the parts of the bathrooms, but let's be honest, those sinks need to go away. They need to go someplace else, maybe to a nice kids classroom for the size of sinks. Work with children, but let's not repurpose them for us. But yes, I know that they plan on doing that in terms of the solar reader, where you can just press the button and see things. That's going back to its home at the hands on museum temporarily while this happens. But the solar array itself has not been impacted. That's still there. It's still working. But the second round, we're going to get a second phase of that that has been put on pause until we can complete this assessment project, which makes sense because it also has to do with whether or not the roof is load bearing enough, which brings up another part of the columns, but that's opening another whole can of worms. We don't have time to address that tonight, but I just wanted to let folks know that was happening. In terms of community high school, I know that you can park there now on Saturdays. The signage issue, I think, has been somewhat resolved. They're writing tickets, though, but they're ticketing people still. Okay. And then obviously Wednesday we can't use it because they use it then. But Wednesday we have free parking in the lot. So Wednesday is a great day. And we always tell people if you know, you don't want to come to Saturday, if you can't get there. Wednesday is still a wonderful market with a lot of great vendors and also not as crowded. So you can take your time, know you both shop there a lot. So, but again, obviously it doesn't make up for the squeeze on Saturday, but we will definitely ask how people got to the market. I think that's something we are already sort of thinking about, and I think that's really important to understand because I think that this also goes back to a broader question, is if we don't have the accurate metrics, if we don't have the accurate data, it's really hard for us to like, look how important we are to people. So I think having this data is really helpful. So anything we can do to tell that to people would be really wonderful because I think a lot of times people just sort of take us for granted because we have been there for so long. This is year 105. We've been at the location for 90 years, so I think, you know, all of this is going to be really great boost. Although there, of course, are some growing pains quite literally along the way, so. But point taking about kicking everyone out from parking all vendors. I like your enthusiasm, is what I'll say. Is what I'll say about that. And yes, I don't know about the token vending machine.

So it may be that tokens are going away in some years in the future. I do not know. Definitely the direction the USDA wants farmers markets to go. Yeah. So wick with this year, senior is going next year. EBT is probably coming in the future. It does seem a little antiquated to use physical tokens. How would it work with double up food books?

Not at this time. All right, thank you. By the way, to those who forwarded emails to our attention, there are three emails, including attachments in the packet. So I encourage everyone, of course, as always, to go take a look at those. So first up in business, Spin operational agreement. Spin's agreement, which allows them to operate their e scooters and e bikes on city streets, is up for renewal. So Raymond will walk us through the agreement and then answer any questions. We also have Jimmy Gilman here from Spin who can help answer questions. Raymond? Yeah, thank you. So I'll go ahead and introduce the item and then kind of turn over to the commission for questions. So first, what I want to do is just kind of share my screen. I think this will just wanted to kind of walk through the resolution that's in your packet, which really kind of shows the majority of what it is we're seeking your recommendation on. So Spin has been operating e scooters in the community since 2019. And then last year, just about a year ago, they introduced e bikes as well. The number initially started off at 200 e scooters, and then that's been kind of increased incrementally over time. Currently, there are 450 e scooters operating and 100 e bikes, and I should say up to 450 e scooters and 100 e bikes. And what's kind of interesting about this is while the city kind of sets the cap, the sort of fee that's paid is split between the city and the university. Just over half the vehicles are licensed by the city of Ann Arbor. In other words, what we get a fee for, and the other half are kind of licensed by the University of Michigan. This is just a sort of understanding that many of these vehicles end up on campus and vice versa. Those that are deployed on campus end up downtown. So it was sort of a mutual agreement that was reached between the university and the city in terms of how to handle this. So this would be a continuation or a request for a continuation of those services for a 6th year with the possibility to extend for two additional years. Right now, we do not anticipate an augmentation of the number of vehicles. And part of that is we always just ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Spin", "insights": [{"observation": "Spin has been operating e scooters in the community since 2019.

So this would be a continuation or a request for a continuation of those services for a 6th year with the possibility to extend for two additional years. Right now, we do not anticipate an augmentation of the number of vehicles. And part of that is we always just try to find kind of this balance of the number of vehicles that are out there so that they can be found by people who are seeking them. But at the same time, there aren't so many that it's creating clutter or nuisance. I know sometimes some users of the vehicles still don't park them appropriately. But Spin has taken some measures to address that, which we can talk about a little bit more detail. So really getting to the resolve clauses that the operating license agreement be extended to spin and that, you know, the mayor and the clerk and city attorney allow execution of the contract. And then, like I said, that it would be authorized for an additional year with the possibility to extend for two additional years. And that could be done administratively. And so that's pretty much what I wanted to introduce the item, as there is the full blown right of way use license agreement included in the package. It in there you see some of the terms of that. It kind of talks about how many vehicles. It talks about insurance and indemnification. It talks about proper parking. It talks about data sharing. It talks about just a lot of these different things that are kind of baked into the agreement itself. All of this has largely remained unchanged. And so it's really just an extending the existing contract with spinning. And then another thing that we put in, there was some information that was shared about some of the spin safety initiatives that are currently up and running. But then we also have Jimmy here to talk about some other things that they're working on as well. So there are some things that are built into the app itself that really encourage riders to ride safely and appropriately and also park the vehicle in such a way appropriately so as not to be an obstruction. There are some geofence zones where the scooters cannot operate. For example, per the university's request, the Diag a scooter or bike ostensibly shuts down. I think it'll go like 1 mph or something, but it largely becomes ineffective. We've also, if you are unaware, we've geofenced downtown and put a speed limiter on it of 10 mph so that any scooter can't go above 10 mph downtown. And we've worked with Spin to establish all of that. I will say also we didn't include a lot of these things have stacked up over time. But if you go back through some of the resolutions that are listed in this newest resolution, you'll see how we've stacked on some other things. So, for example, spin work with us on some equity considerations. So allowing people who are unbanked to check out scooters and then also offering discounts to people who are in public housing. So that's all baked in there as well. And then spin is also partnered with the city for allowing spin scooters to be used for city employees to do business travel and things like that to help reduce the city's carbon footprint as a form of electric mobility. So these are just some of the things that have kind of happened over the years that would be a continuation of those types of services. They're not all necessarily enumerated in this agreement while they're. They're enumerated in the license agreement, but the, you know, actual resolutions that approved all that, you know, you can go back. They're all referenced in the resolution itself. So, for example, it's this whereas clause where it talks about all the different resolutions that have been passed over the last four years related to spin. So those were kind of the highlights I wanted to share. And then maybe what I'll do, if I may, turn it over to Jimmy to see if he wants to share anything additional as well, to piggyback off of that, and then we can answer any questions you may have. I know Pete sent some questions along, so we are prepared to go through those if that's how you want to handle it. There are a couple of different ways, but I'll leave it to the commission in terms of how we want to entertain those questions. First, let's get Jimmy if you wanted to add, or I think you had a chance to look through Peter's questions. Actually, I'll let Jimmy speak if you have anything, and then maybe we'll take some other questions, and then we'll dive into Pete's questions, if that's all right. Sure. That sounds good on my end, and good to see everyone. So, my name is Jimmy Gilman. I manage partnerships for spin, including the Ann Arbor program, for the last several years. I think I had the chance to speak to the commission about a year ago related to some of the equity programming that we were bringing to the program that I know Raymond just mentioned. So, really, I think in terms of some of the novel and unique programming we brought to Ann Arbor, I think Raymond's touched on a lot of it. All I can say is we've really appreciated the city's partnership over the last several years, building the program with these different initiatives, to Raymond's point, that we've been able to stack on top of each other and really make this a developed and built ou", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Spin", "insights": [{"observation": "Spin has taken some measures to address inappropriate parking of e-scooters.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There are geofence zones where the scooters cannot operate, such as the university's Diag, and a downtown speed limiter of 10 mph.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Spin partnered with the city to allow unbanked individuals to check out scooters and to offer discounts to people in public housing.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Spin partnered with the city for use of scooters by city employees for business travel, reducing the city's carbon footprint.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Spin's app includes features to encourage safe and appropriate riding and parking.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Spin", "insights": [{"observation": "Spin has taken some measures to address inappropriate parking of e-scooters.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There are geofence zones where the scooters cannot operate, such as the university's Diag, and a downtown speed limiter of 10 mph.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Spin partnered with the city to allow unbanked individuals to check out scooters and to offer discounts to people in public housing.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Spin partnered with the city for use of scooters by city employees for business travel, reducing the city's carbon footprint.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Spin's app includes features to encourage safe and appropriate riding and parking.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 592444, "chunk_end_time": 1012494, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lb4ZizXfEU", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lb4ZizXfEU&t=592s"}, {"start": 9000, "end": 15000, "text": " or I think you had a chance to look through Peter's questions.

All I can say is we've really appreciated the city's partnership over the last several years, building the program with these different initiatives, to Raymond's point, that we've been able to stack on top of each other and really make this a developed and built out partnership. So I know there are some questions that were sent over ahead of time. I think this is easier just to dive into the questions and have a back and forth and really make this conversational. So happy to leave it at that, and answer any questions, either those that were sent in advance or any other questions that the commission might have let's see if before we get into the ones that were sent, does anybody have any questions that they'd like to ask now into Peter's questions? We'll have time throughout, obviously, too. And afterwards. Okay, so let's dive what Peter had sent. Oh, sorry. Pravina, I want you to go ahead. That's okay. I'm sorry. I just wanted to just verify, are we expanding any of the sites for the spin for the bikes? I do. We had bike racks. Is that going to just be downtown or. I didn't see in the contract. Maybe I missed it. If there's going to be expanded to other parts of the city. Yeah, that's a good question. So both the spin scooters and the spin bikes are dockless systems. So there's both a beauty and sort of a pain point with that. Right. So the fact that they're dockless means a user can pick them up or check them out and leave them without necessarily checking them into a sort of rack or station. That applies to bicycles as well. There are fewer bicycles in the community. There are one for every four scooters, roughly. So finding a bicycle, there just aren't quite as many of them in terms of where they're able to operate. Jimmy can correct me if I'm wrong. It is in the entirety of Ann Arbor. So what I suspect happens, especially with bicycles, is there tends to be some concentrations around campus and downtown where you might find them. We do find that if there are bicycle racks nearby, hopefully users are putting them near those bicycle racks. The bikes don't themselves need to be locked to a bike rack. They actually have a self locking mechanism, but you can lock them to a bike if you want to continue to keep it checked out right under your name and continue to kind of pay the meter on the bike. So in terms of, like, bike parking itself, you're touching on another initiative that we're working on. We have an intern right now on our team that's going through and taking an inventory of all parking on private property outside of downtown. So the distinction here is that most of the bike parking you see downtown is in the public right of way. So it's publicly owned. It's largely put there by the DDA or as part of a capital project, whereas most of the parking outside of downtown tends to be, like, in parking lots or adjacent to businesses, and that tends to be outside of the public right away on private property. So we're trying to get at least an understanding of what that parking infrastructure looks like and the reason why I bring this up. And it's kind of an interesting distinction. You know, we, as a city, can't force someone to park on private property, right? And so since we don't have public bike racks outside of the downtown area, it starts to get into a weird space about, you know, forcing people to end their ride, you know, at a bike rack, for example, if there is no bike rack in the public right of way. So that is something that. That's one of the reasons why we're doing this inventory, just to understand kind of where there are bike facilities and bike racks. And maybe that may inform a shift or a change in terms of how we expect users to end their ride, but right now, we're just kind of. And Jimmy can speak to this. Users are expected to take a picture of when they end their ride, how they left the vehicle, whether it be a scooter or a bike. And if there are complaints about that person or as spin reviews that information, if someone is notoriously parking their bike or scooter incorrectly, as a user, they can get their privileges of using the system revoked. So in other words, if they're blocking crosswalks, if they're tipped over, if there are places they shouldn't be, repeat offenders can kind of go to the doghouse. So that's one of the things that Jimmy and his team have kind of implemented as part of the rollout to make sure that, you know, we try to stay on top of it. I'm going to admit, it doesn't always, you know, there are still some people who park incorrectly, and some still fall through the cracks. We do have an a two fix it ticket as well, so that if a bike or scooter is parked incorrectly, someone can, with their phone or on the app, record that, and then that gets reported to both the city as well as spin to rectify the situation. So I probably went a little deeper than you needed, but I just wanted to say that we continue to think about parking, and we want to make sure that users are doing what they're expected to do, and that we're trying to make sure that the public rights of way are still accessible and being used in ways that we hope them to be used.

The only thing I might add, if I may jump into, I think Raymond outlined that very well. Two other tools that we've employed here are preferred and incentivized parking points that are outlined in the app. So we'll actually incentivize folks to park in specified locations that are indicated in the spin app. They can actually, that folks can see this is an incentivized parking point to make sure that we're incentivized that proper parking in specific locations. So if a user does park in spot as signified in the app, they'll receive a 25% discount off their next trip. So that's one thing that we have in place. Another thing is terema mentions folks need to take a picture of where they park their bike or scooter after completing a trip. We're actually integrating AI surveillance into all of those pictures as well. It used to be more of a manual process, but we're able to use AI now to determine, is this a proper parking location, or is this a location that's obstructing the public right of way to then issue either reminders, warnings, or fines, or ultimately, if we see someone who continues to be non compliant bans from the system. So again, echoing a lot of what Raymond mentioned, but just adding a little bit of color to that from our side too. Yeah. Just wanted to clarify my question a little bit deeper, is, I guess my thought was, I understand that you can pick up in wherever you find a spin, you can grab and go, is there locations where they are housed the next morning, where they're all charged up? Is that only in downtown on campus areas? So we have a deployment map throughout the extent of the city. I would say the areas where we see the highest amount of use are around downtown and campus as two hubs of activity that are within that last one to two mile connection radius. Especially since we've introduced bikes, we have seen more trips to exterior parts of town as well, being a seated mode, being a mode that has cargo capacity. So with the bikes in particular, we've attempted to range our deployments outside of just those two hubs of downtown and the university. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Excuse me. I'll note, I'm really glad to hear the comments from both Raymond and from spin about measures being taken. Given that, I think on the March 20 meeting, we had a comment, a public comment in the email where somebody, a citizen, was complaining about, I think, parking behavior. So to hear that there's some solutions there is great. I think my question was a context question for Raymond. Um, you know, I noticed that this was a non exclusive license, and I think in the February meeting, we had an inquiry from another vendor. And so I'm just looking for general context about how does the city currently respond to inquiries from other scooter vendors? Yeah, that's a good question. We have been in this relationship with spin you know, to go way back. Right. Spin was not the first vendor in town. A different vendor. Bird was actually the first that came in September, I think, of 2018. And so what that kind of prompted was the very first form of the right of way use agreement that you see in your packet. What we pretty much did is we scrambled to kind of put some parameters around their operation. So after six months, after that first term of that agreement went through, we found that that vendor at that time was not really fulfilling the terms of the agreement. And so we discontinued our relationship with bird at that time. Then we had kind of looked to other vendors because there was some interest in the community by the service provided by the scooters. And this was pre pandemic, obviously. So there were a lot more vendors in the space if you followed it. You know, there's bird, there's lime, there's spin, there was. Gotcha. There were, you know, Jimmy could probably rattle them all off. And so, you know, we. We started to engage with other vendors to see who could deliver a service acceptably to the city, and spin kind of came forward, and so we entered into a contract with them. So then we have been courted by other vendors since then. And pretty much what we said is, what more can you bring to the market that isn't more of the same? Right. We already have an existing agreement with spin at the time. And so the question is, you know, what more can you offer, you know, either in terms of mobility options? So, for example, you know, is there something like a moped, like that type of scooter, or are there other incentives, other things? And we haven't really. Some companies are, say they can match, but they haven't really offered anything beyond what we're already getting with spin. And so, as such, we've just said, well, until you can show something different, you know, you're welcome to come and bring something to us, and we'll route it through, but it may not, staff may not recommend approval of it, and so that's how things have been handled today.

Sure. Great. Thank you. All right, let's dive into Pete's questions. Do one of you all have those up to there? Kind of. Peter, maybe you want to guide us through your questions here and let Raymond and or Jimmy reply as we go through. Sure. Thanks for joining us. Talk this over with us, Jimmy. Appreciate that. Absolutely. So the first, I organize the questions in a few sections, and the first one is about tracking and preventing scooter crashes. And the background there is that we had two serious scooter crashes in 2023 that were sort of shockingly similar, with riders hitting the front left fender of cars and then getting head injuries from contact with the windshield. And so I was left at the time wondering, is this a common kind of crash? Because to get two of them in quick succession like that was somewhat shocking. So, as I say here, also, I reached out to spin and didn't get any response. Maybe I'm not sending those notes to the right people or what, I don't know. But so the questions that I have then around this are, how do you track crashes involving riders? That's the first one. And related to that, can you see how common this type of crash is where people end up with head injuries after impacting the windshield of oncoming traffic? Yeah. Thank you, Peter. And to answer your first question here. So in the future, if you want to direct all inquiries my way, and I can leave you with my email address to make sure that those are responded to in a timely fashion. And absolutely, we'll make sure all inquiries are responded to in the future. So in terms of tracking crashes for riders, so there are a few different modes. One is reports through our customer support team. So having a report to our customer service, either calling in or emailing, those reports are then documented. We make sure we capture the vehicle in question and do our due diligence from there on exactly what all the details were surrounding the reported incident. I know in the past there have also been incidents reported to the city that may not be reported to our team, but then we work closely together on, again, gathering those details, the scooter in question, the rider in question, to make sure we're carrying out a full investigation process at that time. I think one thing on this point, in terms of how common is the type of crash, how common are incidents on scooters in general? We do see incidents on shared micro mobility devices as underreported, similar to how they are under reported on bicycles or in pedestrian accidents as well. Actually, we're currently working with a company called Flare to integrate and pilot crash detection technology into our offerings as well. This actually started as a pilot program and research program at the University of Michigan. As part of their McIty program in collaboration with College of Engineering and Innovation Center, a few students have been helping us, using spin scooters, develop both incident detection and rider safety scores that can be determined through gyroscope readings, tilt and sway of different, you know, risky riding behavior or behavior that would indicate an incident has occurred on a scooter. So that's something we're really excited about to pilot moving forward. I think that research will be able both to detect more incidents as they occur out there and to determine rider behavior leading up to those incidents so that we can, you know, create the safest service possible. So those are my initial thoughts, but happy to go down any of those threads even further. Okay. Those sound like good initiatives, like how long before we should expect to see some. Some improvement and some, like, some relevant outcome? It's a timeline. Sure. Again, it's something that currently, research is being done. I know that the students with whom we were working at the university were hoping to categorize some of this research moving into the summertime. They actually just presented some of it to us. But, yeah. Can you clarify a bit more on improvement or exactly what the sort of outcome on that side, too, just so I can. By way of comparison, my tally for last year shows four serious bicycle crashes in Ann Arbor. No fatalities. And that's all the bike riders on all the bikes in Ann Arbor. The fleet of spin scooters. We saw two serious crashes, and one of them was fatal. So when we're looking at these 450 scooters that we have in Ann Arbor, we had half as many incidents as all of the bicycles and all the riders and all the miles traveled in Ann Arbor. To me, that is. That's not a good track record. And I want to see some real, tangible improvements towards curtailing those injuries and the fatality that we had in 2023. What is the plan to get there? So that's what I mean when I say when are we likely to see some improvements from that technology or from some of the other technologies that I've brought forth in the questions that I asked. Sure. So I think we can plan to see more integration with that flare program into our app moving forward into this calendar year. We're actually looking to put another research project on MSU's campus forward as w", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Spin", "insights": [{"observation": "The company has not offered anything beyond their existing agreement in terms of mobility options to the market.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}, {"observation": "Two serious scooter crashes in 2023 involving Spin scooters were reported, with riders getting head injuries after hitting the front left fender of cars.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Spin did not respond to inquiries about tracking crashes involving riders.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Spin plans to integrate and pilot crash detection technology with a company called Flare to improve rider safety.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Spin is working with the University of Michigan as part of the McIty program to develop incident detection and rider safety scores using gyroscope readings and other data.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Efforts include creating the safest service possible by understanding risky riding behavior and incidents on scooters.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Spin", "insights": [{"observation": "The company has not offered anything beyond their existing agreement in terms of mobility options to the market.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}, {"observation": "Two serious scooter crashes in 2023 involving Spin scooters were reported, with riders getting head injuries after hitting the front left fender of cars.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Spin did not respond to inquiries about tracking crashes involving riders.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Spin plans to integrate and pilot crash detection technology with a company called Flare to improve rider safety.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Spin is working with the University of Michigan as part of the McIty program to develop incident detection and rider safety scores using gyroscope readings and other data.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Efforts include creating the safest service possible by understanding risky riding behavior and incidents on scooters.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1601858, "chunk_end_time": 2100623, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lb4ZizXfEU", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lb4ZizXfEU&t=1601s"}, {"start": 24000, "end": 30000, "text": "shows four serious bicycle crashes in Ann Arbor.

So I think we can plan to see more integration with that flare program into our app moving forward into this calendar year. We're actually looking to put another research project on MSU's campus forward as well. And I think this data, just to put it in perspective, what exactly we can use it for is a dashboard to see where we are seeing either incidents or risky writing behavior, and risky either being from the user side of things, or due to physical infrastructure in a specific spot. And then on our end, we can use that for other interventions, such as geofencing an area, as a slower area, potentially making no ride zones. I think one advantage that we do have as a shared system is we are able to geofence in specific spots to control where scooters and bikes can go, where they can't go, and at what speed they're going in those areas. So, again, I think it's something that is a continuous improvement for us and a continuous initiative to address safety for us. And this data will allow us to build upon some of the things that we've already done. For example, as Raymond mentions, having the downtown area as a slow zone, having the diag as a no ride zone, and potentially incorporating that in other parts of the city as well. Praveena, you got a question? Yeah, Peter, thanks for this document. The second last bullet that you have on here, that kind of intrigued me. Raymond, do we not have information on our city page about the scooter program and the safety requirements and some of the things that Jimmy has already identified and yourself about, you know, these incentives or where they should park or what is the protocol? Not. I'm not sure, like, what all entails, but it may be good to benchmark these other cities and have something and aren't on page. Yeah, we can do that. I think, you know, we worked with spin to actually, on some of the. I lost Raymond. Anybody else losing? Can you say that again, Raymond? I lost you. Yeah. Sorry. Am I back? Yes. Yeah, my Internet is choppy. I don't know why. So, yeah, we've worked with Jimmy and the spin team over the years on some of the safety messaging that's in the app. So we were kind of relying on the users of the scooters to access that information through the app. Because, for example, if you ever use a spin, you actually have to go through a little tutorial on safety. You have to agree to terms and conditions and all those things. So there are several things you have to do in order to demonstrate your understanding of the safety protocols. But we can also put information on our website the first time that request has been made of us, so we can do that. That's not a problem, Raymond. To clarify, though, the links I have here are spin web pages that are devoted to the operations in a particular city. They are not city run web pages. And I can clarify. Right. But I think Praveena's question was about whether the city could put it on, unless I misunderstood. So was that. That's just information somewhere, I'm sure. I mean, maybe Jimmy can speak to how they've done it in other cities, but maybe it's something that's a joint effort. Right? And that's exactly right. I think more recently, we've seen cities desiring to put information on their websites just because it's already an established site and location that folks may be viewing. Who are residents of the area. You know, it's something we could do on our end. You know, we'd be happy to provide the data to or information to the city to put up on their. On y'all's end of things as well. So, yeah, again, something that we can certainly work together on to make happen. Okay. Thank you. Do you want to move? Move on? Well, there's a couple other points on this paragraph that I guess I'd like to talk about. I mean, is geofencing something that could be applied to streets that we know have are in poor condition? It certainly can be. Obviously, that's something we'd want to work closely with the city on. I think geofencing is extremely effective in the right circumstances. For example, slowing scooters and e bikes in a high pedestrian location to keep safe intermixing of shared devices and pedestrians. I think on on street scenarios, there can be challenges with slowing down a device or stopping a device that's riding with the flow of traffic. So, you know, personally, as a cyclist, I know I feel safest when I'm able to ride with the flow of traffic, you know, in, on a roadway. But again, it's something that we could chat about if there are specific or unique circumstances where we think it would be better to slow down a scooter or bike or stop a scooter or bike from riding in that location. Again, I think there are just a multitude of different factors to consider when making that decision, too. Okay. I mean, this question stems from the. The fact that Ann Arbor and really, the entire state of Michigan has a lot of pavement that's in poor condition. I don't know if you're from Michigan or if you have spent a lot of time here, but that's the reality of pavement here. With our funding situation and our freeze and thaw cycle, we just have a lot of pavement in bad shape. And this is a thing that.

With our funding situation and our freeze and thaw cycle, we just have a lot of pavement in bad shape. And this is a thing that. I think this is a place where spin could improve its safety for riders, is protecting them from areas that are not able to be traversed on a vehicle with very small wheels. Like a scooter. Yeah, I would just throw a little caution to that for a couple of reasons. I mean, as Jimmy just mentioned, there's, you know, as I mentioned, when you hit the diag, the vehicle almost comes to a stop. So what I think one of the concerns would be is if we create a patchwork of where the scooter can and can't be operated so that users will find it very difficult to actually use the vehicle for the trip purpose that they intended. And then, you know, as a reminder, while it's not outright encouraged, but, you know, as a reminder for some of the work this commission did on the micro mobility ordinance, or what we call the personal mobility vehicle ordinance, you know, these vehicles are allowed to be ridden on the sidewalk. So if, you know, again, if it's done so in a safe fashion and is respectful to pedestrians, and that's all written into the ordinance. But, you know, the idea is, you know, if we limit where people can go due to the condition of the roadway, then we limit kind of this as a form of mobility. And I appreciate the point. You know, today was bike to everywhere day. Hopefully people got on their bikes today. I traversed a road that was not particularly comfortable. It was pothole ridden, but I still rode my bike on it, and I wouldn't have been dismayed if I wouldn't be allowed to ride my bike on that facility just because it's pothole. So I just think there's a trade off here that we have to kind of keep in mind about, you know, mode shift getting people into sustainable forms of transportation, but then limiting their ability to use these forms of transportation. Okay. I mean, point taken, Raymond. I feel compelled to point out, though, that a bicycle with 26 inch wheels is better able to manage rough pavement than a scooter with six or eight inch wheels or however big it is on a spin scooter. Right. I mean, that's. That's physics. The other point on here that I wanted to point out, Jimmy, was the safe start feature that that bird has used to. Has that proven effective? Is it something that we can use here in Ann Arbor? We can certainly put it in place. We find it most useful during later night hours, from potentially, like a 12:00 a.m. to 05:00 a.m. or something like that. I do have some data to show its effectiveness, but, yeah, something we certainly could put in place here as well is a feature that's available to us. Okay. I think it's worth trying. Sure. Yeah. All right, real quick, briefly, how does that work in practice? I haven't seen one with that feature before. Yeah. So it would be the flow of when a user is starting a trip, it would receive all of the program rules and safety screens, as we call them, before they're actually able to access a device. This would be a final screen where there would be a message that says some warning to the effect of do not use a spin scooter if you are under the influence. And then there would either be a prompt to type in a specific phrase or test a user's reaction speed, both of which testing, first of all, just giving that final message and alert of do not use this as a transportation mode if you are inebriated. And second of all, having a user prompt and sort of a task to make sure that they are capable of using the device, which would actually bar them from using a scooter if they're not able to follow that prompt. So again, something we think is most useful targeted in some of those hours where there might be that risk or temptation of folks to use a device while inebriated to really add an extra level of protection against that. Okay. So no added hard, it's more software on the app. Okay. No breathalyzer on the handlebars or anything, correct? Yeah. It's a product offering in the app. We recognize it's not one singular silver bullet, right, to restrict users from riding while inebriated. It's education at in person events. It's those safety screens and rules that folks see before every trip. And then this is just another added product that we can put on in the app as that final screen that someone is viewing and to make sure that they're doing that short test. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, thanks for the question. You want to move on to the next section of questions, is that right, Peter? I think the next section is around helmet usage. Yeah. So helmets are really put forth as, at least in the spins online information put forth as an important safety feature. And there's a lot dedicated to them in safety instruction that's been presented to renters. And I got here text of a press release that Spin signed onto that said that helmet use should be encouraged. I guess from my perspective, it really looks like the user experience that spin is trying to create for its scooter users does not jive well with helmet usage. So, like, if I ride my bike somewhere, I can leave my helmet strapped to my bike.

I guess from my perspective, it really looks like the user experience that spin is trying to create for its scooter users does not jive well with helmet usage. So, like, if I ride my bike somewhere, I can leave my helmet strapped to my bike. I got a place for it. I don't have to take it in the pub with me or I don't have to, you know, I don't have to carry it around. We've also got videos that spin has posted that shows people, like, giving up on waiting for a bus and instead opting to take a spin scooter. And where do they find a helmet under those circumstances? There's no chance of them having a helmet under those circumstances. I will point out that in the video that I'm talking about, this renter finds a helmet draped across the handlebars. Of the scooter that he, he notices. And that's a really unrealistic representation of what it's like to use a helmet with a spin scooter, and I think, unhelpful. So spin is, is advertising the idea, you know, in this press release that we should be encouraging helmet usage, though it shouldn't be mandatory. And I guess I'm wondering if this is an important part of, of Spin's safety protocol. Like, what is Spin doing to encourage people to use helmets? And also, I'll point out, it's not working very well. One of the studies that's cited in that press release measured helmet usage among scooter riders at like 5% compared to 50% for bike riders. I went downtown and watched scooter riders at the corner of North U and State street for an hour, and I saw one out of 13 scooter riders wearing a helmet. That's 7%. So that jives with the 5% in the study. So if this is going to be an important part of Spin's safety message for scooter riders, like, we need to be doing more to encourage the use. And I'm going to come right out and say, I think that that encouragement role and that responsibility needs to go to Spin because they are the company that's trying to make money off of renting scooters. This is not a thing that can be left to advocate groups or to the city. So what are we doing and when are we going to get better about this encouragement? I mean, that's what these questions are about. And then I also do want to point out, and I included pictures in the document, that when we look at helmets on Spin's website, there's broken links everywhere. This is a place where we need improvement. Yeah, I'll dive in and try to touch on all of those different points. Peter. So first and foremost, we, at our in person events that we host in Ann Arbor or at the university, hand out free helmets to folks that visit the spin table, visit the spin tent. I can't tell you the exact number that we've given away over the last five years, but it's in the hundreds, if not thousands, of helmets that we've been able to give away and distribute to folks who are either spin users or prospective spin users. So something we've done in the past, something we'll continue to do, so that folks who are interested in spin have that helmet available to them as we're discussing with them the service, how to use it safely, and what the program rules and regulations look like. So that's one thing I know your point on coming up to a scooter. If, for example, you missed the bus or you took a separate mode to arrive at a destination, but you're using a scooter to return, for example. And we get that question at events. We refer folks to a company with whom we have a referral partnership called Overaid that sells fold up helmets. So that's an option for, for example, if you are a regular or semi regular micro mobility user, you can have a helmet that folds up and is stored in your backpack. So if you do come upon a scooter in sort of more of a spur of the moment usage scenario, you have a helmet that's more easily stored in a backpack, in luggage that you can then wear and use as part of your trip. So that's another company that we refer to for, you know, that as an option and just bring awareness to that we have to your point, and I think has shown in some of these videos, experimented in the past with leaving helmets on scooter and bike handlebars for repeat use by riders. We run into challenges there just with, you know, vandalism of the helmets if they aren't strapped to anything, um, as well as just, I think, sanitary concerns of sharing helmets out there and really not having a feasible way to sanitize between use. So again, something we certainly have experimented with, but I think some of those challenges of vandalism and sanitation really make that challenging. Again, those are some of the physical interventions of encouraging helmet use. Again, in our app, we can always add an extra in app message saying, please wear a helmet before each trip as part of the program rules and regulations. And one thing that actually is in the pipeline that I believe we could offer as an option later this year is in the end of ride screen.

So again, something we certainly have experimented with, but I think some of those challenges of vandalism and sanitation really make that challenging. Again, those are some of the physical interventions of encouraging helmet use. Again, in our app, we can always add an extra in app message saying, please wear a helmet before each trip as part of the program rules and regulations. And one thing that actually is in the pipeline that I believe we could offer as an option later this year is in the end of ride screen. If a user takes a selfie and they're wearing a helmet in that selfie, we can AI verify that picture to then give a 25% discount off their next trip. So again, another incentive for if you're wearing to use a helmet and if you're wearing that helmet to take a picture and then offer a financial incentive for a future trip. So, you know, we try to do it on the in app product side of things, with reminders, in person giveaways and referrals, and then also a financial incentive for it as a post trip measure. I also flagged, I know you mentioned the link on the website. I flagged that to our engineering team to make sure that's back up and running, that's an engineering bug on our side of things, but something we'll make sure is reconciled. But again, those would be the three main camps of things that I'd say we're doing on our side to encourage it. Can you say the name of that folding helmet company once more called overaid? Okay. And I can send you a link to it. That would be great. That is the kind of thing that I'd like to see featured prominently or that I would expect to see when I follow that helmet link on your website. Yeah. Just a comment, maybe not entirely relevant to the work of the commission, but as somebody whose whole family has had circumferences, they're in, like, the 99 percentile. Almost always, if there's a giveaway or a shared helmet, never fits any of us. So this is just a personal plug for considering, you know, inclusivity of people with very large head circumference. Totally. And something we do try to have a range. So we have small, medium, and large helmets with, like, foam padding inserts that are certified to, you know, fit those in between sizes as well. But it's a good call out, you know, to maybe even expand extra small or extra large and have other options available, too. All right, let's move on to the last section here of your questions, which are around speed, I believe. Speed limits. Peter, do you want to introduce this? Sure. So there's a study that's cited here, and the study measured the speed of bike riders and the speed of e scooter riders. And I guess I'm really, what I'm trying to do is get to the bottom of where is this 15 miles per hour recommendation that that is in the press release that's been presented? Like, what backs that up? Because the Aralano and Fang study that was linked in the press release doesn't back that up. And it even shows that 15 mph would be faster than most of the bikes that were measured in this study. So I understand how faster might be better for a user's perceived experience, but I don't see any data backing up that faster speed limits are safer. And I guess I just, it felt disingenuous for it to be presented that way and for the data in that study to be presented that way or the conclusions of that study to be presented. Sure. So just to jump in, and I know this study uses bicycles. Right. As sort of a reference point. And I know bicycle. There's more research out there right now on bikes compared to e scooters. Right. So I think a lot of what we've gleaned in terms of inferences has been studying bikes as a mode to then glean that to other micro mobility modes such as scooters as well. I will say, I think the research that we're doing with the company flare, as I mentioned, both at UM and MSU, to determine safe riding conditions and safe riding scores under different environments and under different speeds can really go a long way to show us, is there really a higher rate of incidents if someone is going 15 versus, let's say, 12? Don't think there are a ton of studies out there yet that are really looking at tilt, sway, and incident data with speed limits to really come to an inference. Obviously, there are more on bicycles just because it's an older mode. Any scooters really have only come on the scene in the last six years, more or less. So something through that research, I think we'll be able to get some better data and then really consider that recommendation and ultimate speed limit of the vehicles. One thing I will point out too, is there are already out there a ton of different personal e mobility devices that go far beyond 20 or 15 mph, whether it's scooters, e bikes, one wheels. So I think a real benefit of our mode is that it is speed governed at that 15 can be governed less again, in certain circumstances, such as in downtown Ann Arbor. So those are a couple of thoughts. And then I guess the last point is just balancing that. Being able to access a destination for an individual who may need to access work, and it's 4 miles across town, having the speed to get them there efficiently, and have that access to place of work, place of school, et cetera, as a consideration in this as well. So, again, as the industry progresses and matures, and as we conduct more research, I think more data to back that up, specifically on the e scooter side of things. But those are just my initial thoughts of thinking about speed limits, speed governors, what we're able to offer as a shared mode, and where I think we can take it moving forward. Can I make one last comment on what you said? That's okay, Jimmy. E scooters are new. Yes. And we have a lot of infrastructure in place for reporting bike crashes and recording bike crashes. And. And our standardized forms, like the ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Helmet Safety Initiative", "insights": [{"observation": "We try to do it on the in app product side of things, with reminders, in person giveaways and referrals, and then also a financial incentive for it as a post trip measure.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "If a user takes a selfie and they're wearing a helmet in that selfie, we can AI verify that picture to then give a 25% discount off their next trip.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Possibility to include extra small or extra large helmets for inclusivity.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Speed Limit Study", "insights": [{"observation": "The study measured the speed of bike riders and the speed of e scooter riders to determine safe riding conditions and safe riding scores under different environments and under different speeds.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There is concern about the lack of data showing that faster speed limits are safer.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "A real benefit of our mode is that it is speed governed at 15 mph, which can be adjusted in certain circumstances for safety.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Helmet Safety Initiative", "insights": [{"observation": "We try to do it on the in app product side of things, with reminders, in person giveaways and referrals, and then also a financial incentive for it as a post trip measure.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "If a user takes a selfie and they're wearing a helmet in that selfie, we can AI verify that picture to then give a 25% discount off their next trip.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Possibility to include extra small or extra large helmets for inclusivity.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Speed Limit Study", "insights": [{"observation": "The study measured the speed of bike riders and the speed of e scooter riders to determine safe riding conditions and safe riding scores under different environments and under different speeds.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There is concern about the lack of data showing that faster speed limits are safer.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "A real benefit of our mode is that it is speed governed at 15 mph, which can be adjusted in certain circumstances for safety.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 3149492, "chunk_end_time": 3616824, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lb4ZizXfEU", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lb4ZizXfEU&t=3149s"}, {"start": 44000, "end": 50000, "text": "ess again, in certain circumstances, such as in downtown Ann Arbor.

Can I make one last comment on what you said? That's okay, Jimmy. E scooters are new. Yes. And we have a lot of infrastructure in place for reporting bike crashes and recording bike crashes. And. And our standardized forms, like the UD ten crash report, allows us to easily sort all of the bike crashes that happen in the city or in the state. I have access to that information, and so does everyone on the Internet. I don't have easy access to a list of all the scooter crashes that happened in the state. And that's part of why I'm demanding that from spin. You guys are in a unique position to have access to that data, and in my mind, you have a responsibility to share it, because you are leading us into this new space with scooters and this new technology that's, like you said, is only six years old. You have a responsibility to fill in the gaps where the rest of the infrastructure hasn't caught up with this new technology. And so I hope that you. I hope the spin will take that responsibility seriously. When I talk about seeing data, like, I would like to see more than just the crashes that happened in Ann Arbor. I'd like to see, like, what are the crashes that have happened statewide with spin scooters? What is the incident of crashes in similar cities like Kalamazoo or East Lansing or wherever? What is the comparison between crashes that get reported on spin bikes versus spin scooters? You have a very good comparison there. And so, um, just to say, as you did in the. In the note that you sent, that, you know, that we've had this many spin rides and only this many spin crashes just isn't enough. Like, we need to be able to compare that to the other modes that. That we have, like walking and biking and. And unfortunately, we don't have that right now. So in order for me to feel comfortable saying that the city should continue this partnership with spin, I really want to see more of that data, and I really want you guys to step up and own that responsibility for keeping your users safe and our residents safe. So, thank you for your time tonight. And I want to say, in general, I'm in favor of these, like, micro, micro mobility solutions. I'm glad that we have them, and I'm eager to find a way for spin to keep providing them, but it needs to be in a way that keeps everyone safe, so, or as safe as possible, at least. So, thank you. Thank you for the questions. And I guess just, you know, we really want to embrace that role and that part in the micro mobility sector and moving what safety looks like in the sector forward. Right. So. And that's something, you know, the research that I've mentioned that we're doing at MSU, at um, and at various other institutions across the country is something that I think is fairly unique to us as well. You know, being able to engage in research projects and be that partner to a community to move forward the thought on this, to improve what safety measures look like, what safety interventions look like, and to your point, Peter. Get that data at a more granular level. Not just the reported data, but then also data that we're gleaning from other sensors in our vehicles that even, I would say, go beyond personal bike pad reports, where you're often not getting those near misses, you're not getting the, you know, smaller scale incidents, but something that I think we can really tap into moving forward, both on the micro mobility side of things, but planning for bike and pad infrastructure and different interventions in cities. So something we really do want to be an active partner with, both here and throughout the country, and happy to keep sharing on those efforts as we move forward with them. But thank you for the questions and for giving me the opportunity to be here and speak today. Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much for coming, Jimmy. And thanks for all the questions and the research. Peter. At this time, for no more questions, is there a motion to recommend approval of the renewal of Spin's operational agreement, which would allow them to continue operating their e bike and e scooters in Ann Arbor? So moved. Moved by Matt, seconded by Wang Wu. All those in favor of the motion, please say yes or raise your hand. Okay. All those opposed to the motion, please say no or raise your hand. All right, the motion passes. Thanks again, Jimmy, for coming by. Do we have time for one more quick question for Jimmy? Yeah. I mean, we've already voted, but. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Not. I mean, I guess. To what extent does spin consider seniors? I'm thinking it's like a demographic or a customer segment or, I was thinking, if it's a senior in Ann Arbor, wouldn't it be great if we could provide micro mobility?

I think these things need to be added into the agreement and then I'm willing to vote in favor of it. So sorry for being slow on the, on the, on the response there to that resolution. Is there any opportunity for us to add that in? If not, I guess take that. I think that back in on the general is kind of tricky, you know, doing amendments in general. Is it?

I can they approve this. So I think, you know, there's the opportunity there.

But especially in the interest of time, I want to try to keep moving here, too. So up next is the regional transportation authority update. We're joined this evening by Julie Roberts, who will give us an update on the activities and projects of the regional transportation Authority. So, Julia, the floor is yours. I think you have sharing. Screen sharing. There we go. All right. Good evening, everyone. I'm Julia Roberts. I'm the planning and innovation director for RTA or the regional transit authority for Southeast Michigan. And I believe I have about 20 minutes, but I can shorten that if you want to move on to other items and leave some time for questions and answers at the end. Just a few updates. I'm not sure the last time that someone from RTA presented to this commission, so I'll try to give some highlights and overviews of what we're working on, how that applies to Ann Arbor. And happy to answer anything at the end or chime in if you have questions along the way. So for anyone who is familiar with RTA or maybe new, we have a pretty complex universe. So in addition to the city of Ann Arbor within Washtenaw county, we also work with Wayne, Oakland, McComb, and have board representatives, two from each of our four counties, for transit, as well as a chair from an appointment by the governor and an appointment as well by the city of Detroit's mayor. We work as sort of an umbrella organization for the existing transit agencies, including the Ann Arbor area transit Authority. Transportation Authority are the ride DDOT in Detroit, smart in the suburbs of metro Detroit and the people mover downtown Detroit, elevated rail, as well as the queue line, which we are undergoing due diligence upon their request for us to acquire the light rail system along Woodward Avenue. We also work with other transportation providers, particularly shared transportation like Mogo bike share and other nonprofits and shared mobility operators, including e scooters and others. We have an array of responsibilities, including funding passing through all of the federal and state dollars to our direct recipient providers and others, planning for long term transit and partnership with our providers, and accelerating some of these initiatives through pilots and other grant initiatives, as well as coordinating. So we're really here to serve in terms of support, both financially and technically, to work together, to think innovatively and be subject matter experts with our partners, as well as to manage all of the different forms of funding that come through our region at a regional level. So for I'm not sure how many of you have been following this closely, but from a transit specific perspective, we have seen a recent uptick in local bus operating funds last year with a one time funding increase. That amount was then increased above the base level from the governor's proposal this year, but not quite at the same level that it was for this past year. And since then, the House and Senate committees have recommended closer to what's this past year's level, but not quite what the need is for the region, which you can see in purple on the far right. So we're talking on the order of tens of hundreds of millions of dollars, and it's something that is really badly needed in southeast Michigan.

As many of you may or may not know, we are the second lowest funded region for public transportation in the country for the 25 largest metropolitan areas, and we are the lowest of the top 15 large urbanized areas. And our region covers both the Ann Arbor urbanized area and the Detroit urbanized areas, as well as some of the rural and small urban communities in the surrounding areas. So this is both encouraging and shows a picture that there's still room for progressive we've been working with our state representatives on that account and also working to if you think of transit as inherently more equitable than other forms of transportation in general, there's still always room for focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion more intentionally. And so we're undergoing a program this year to be developed how specifically that will be implemented bringing together our business plan principles for equity with our regional transit master plan goals, strategies and actions. And so some of the things we're looking at are a DEI objectives workshop to bridge those two pieces of our organization together and kind of formulating the vision for the future of how do we incorporate DEI as an agency and specifically with community engagement through a roadmap as well as some next steps and ideas, recognizing that we may not be experts in everything and we don't have all of the ideas. So we really want to get some input from our partners, both consulting with ADR as well as bringing that back to the public through some of our community engagement efforts and implementing this. So we've kicked it off this spring. We're just starting to go underway with that and we're really excited for this initiative and threading that through all the work that we do for a geographical view of our region. I mentioned some of the providers that we work with. In addition to the ride, we also work with Myride two through ageways, legally known as the area agency on aging one b, and that provides a call center and an online portal for people to be able to do travel training, plan their trips across borders. Because we know people work and live outside of red, geographically penned lines on a map. And we want to make sure that we're going to continue to work towards making that easier to access as we move forward. As a region, we work with over 80 communities and 30 nonprofit organizations, and we're what we call a small but mighty team of about nine people. We do work with some consultants, but we primarily partner as our staff and team members directly as much as possible. So we cover all sorts of different modes, as I mentioned. So in addition to the micro mobility we mentioned and kind of the fixed route buses and rail, we also work with demand response shuttles. So both on demand and microtransit, paratransit as well as carpooling and van pooling. And you'll notice on this map, in case anybody caught it, there is an area in southeast Washtenaw where the gray is not quite as dark in terms of community transit provider service areas. That is because of a technical definition. While outside of the rides urbanized area Wave, where I was the executive director for three years before coming to RTA and People's Express, who we partnered with closely. They operate in kind of the small urban and rural areas of the county. People's express service has a different fair model and so it is based per mile rather than a fixed fare. And so depending on how you define public transit that can sometimes fall outside of the scope and it just means it speaks to the affordability of if you're taking a short trip, then it's easy to do. If you're taking a longer trip, then sometimes it may be more challenging for folks, especially lower income individuals and families. So that's something that, you know, we're, one of the things we're working towards as, as a region is how do we align our fair policies. And I think that's a longer term conversation and aspiration. So that kind of leads into what are we trying to do. Our goals from our most recent update of our regional transit master plan, including the need for funding to do any of these things, but with funding, improve, expand, innovate and sustain public transit in the region. So improving existing services, expanding new transit, building off of the successes within Washtenaw county and the ride with your most recent millage and other local millages, innovating resilient projects and sustaining future programs. So you'll see here is a list of our top ten investment priorities and that was consolidated from 23 strategies that we had last year to make it a little bit more bite size. And we'll continue to refine that in the next year with hopefully grouping these into buckets like services, resources, both onboard and off board transit. Because we know everybody is a pedestrian whether they take transit or not. We all use transit as a community to our benefit and then also resources. So things like making sure our equipment is up to par as we replace it and improve it, and that our workforce development is one that can continue to thrive.

Another thing that is not on here, but we go into more detail in the plans on our website if you'd like to check it out. We have about three actions per at least three actions per each of these investment priorities, looking at funding scenarios of what happens if we have no new funding, what happens if we have one time funding and what happens if we have sustainable funding. And so we'll continue to prioritize those as we move forward. A little bit about some of the pilots that we're working on. Some of you may be familiar with the Detroit to Ann Arbor Express, Nonstop Express in partnership with the ride. This was started a couple of years ago in earnest. It technically started a couple of days before the Covid-19 shutdown and then we had to press pause for a little while, but have restarted fairly successfully with about 7000 trips a month now and most recently over 1000 trips for the NFL draft where we had so much demand. A few events we've sold out of our 11:00 return trip to Ann Arbor and we actually added an extra two midnight buses on that Thursday evening and an extra one midnight bus on that Friday evening. We've also based on that model and these were grant funded, these are grant funded pilots through the congestion mitigation and air quality as well as carbon reduction programs. We started a Detroit Air Express, similar to air ride from Detroit to DTW and that seen about three and a half thousand riders in the first month. Both services run about 16 round trips a day. The fares are $6 in advance if you book online, $8 at the door with discounts for seniors, people with disabilities, students and frequent travelers for ten passes and 50 ride passes as low as $2 if you're a regular commuter. I myself take d two, a two, and it's about hourly service. The grant budgets are each a little over, around two, two and a half million for a little over a year or two, depending on the grant. And that's in partnership with the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments. So for anybody who wants to use the service and know more about where it is, we have the d two a two stops at the Blake Transit center downtown Ann Arbor, taking people to Grand Circus park in downtown Detroit or really halfway between downtown and Midtown. The DAX or Dax Detroit Air Express stops at Washington and State street right around the corner from the Rosa Parks Transit center across the street from the book Cadillac Weston Hotel and takes people directly to the DTW terminals, both McNamara and Evans. And we have a lot of thanks to our contractual partnership, Michigan Flyer, our marketing teams who helped bring this news to the community, both invirv and adwater. And these are both intended services for commuters and visitors. So we see a good mix of people using them. We are going to be reviewing these services through analysis this summer and some onboard surveys and community surveys. So it'll be an opportunity to look to how we want these to move in the future, growing or sustaining or otherwise. And then the last kind of nugget I'd like to touch on today is just our mobility wallet. That's coming up. This is a pilot. We know that we have, for example, easy fare in the Ann Arbor area and dart through token transit in the Detroit and suburban areas. And so we're looking to how do we do in the future, a regional system. And so we've really done some, some great work to investigate what could work best for our region. We're about to release an RFP for that through a $1 million state grant of the Michigan Mobility wallet challenge. There are two other projects that are concurrently operating in the state to using existing platforms. And rather than just taking something out of the box, we really wanted to examine what's best for our communities before jumping into it. So our goals are to make it easier for people to travel. And with that, looking at not only visual validations, but potentially physical validators. And what I mean by that is not just showing a smartphone to a vehicle operator, but also potentially a physical card for people who either can't afford smartphones or may have a government phone, but not a lot of great access to connectivity. And so making sure that unbanked populations also have an easy way to get around. Regardless, that may be a phase two, because this initial pilot scope may require additional funding for some of the hardware that would go with that. So we're looking to see what's feasible through some of these proposals. And long term, our goal is to build towards a mobility as a service platform that can expand people's access for not only the payment piece, but also maybe fare capping. So if you ride a bunch of times and you aren't getting the same benefits as someone who can pay for multiple rides up front, that eventually that would kick in, or that would, that average would kick in automatically, regardless of how you're paying, that we can have nonprofits that can subsidize transportation directly.

And we're just starting small with 50 or so people focused around connections to work and in partnership with the United Way of southeastern Michigan. So with that, I do see a couple of items in the chat. Great. Thanks so much, Julia. It's nice to see you. I have a question about the. Well, not question. First, I want to just say I took the d two, a two service a couple of weeks ago, and I just want to say it was phenomenal. It was my first time. I did talk to a lot of riders to find out how many Times they were taking it. There were people who are loading up their bikes and getting to Detroit. I had one person tell me that they were also using the flyer to get airport a lot, which was they said that's their main mode of transportation. So huge proponents. I would love if we could get some more of those voices to hear how their experiences are to encourage more people to use these two services. My question is, I maybe touched on this and I missed it, but how long is the funding model for both services? And is there a plan or hope for implementation? Or what is the timeline we're looking at and costs maybe not. Yeah, definitely funding. I'm glad you had a good experience. First of all, that's been my experience so far as well, but it's nice to hear one that's shared. And we've had overwhelmingly positive responses so far. I will say that the D two a two funding, the initial grant funding is scheduled to go through the end of this calendar year, and then after that, we have some potential ongoing grant funding, but we want to evaluate how it's gone these first couple of years before committing to continuing anything. And really that'll be up to our team and our board to determine based on public feedback and general analysis of the route. But so far so good. So hopefully we'll be able to keep it moving forward into 2025. And with the Detroit Air Express, which is funded separately from air ride, that is, DAX is funded for at least the first year. So that'll go through the beginning of 2025 with the option, the possibility of extending up to an additional six to nine months. So we again have some potential grant funding to sustain that, and then at some point, we'll need to look towards long term sustainable funding. Thanks, Julia. Yeah. And you just even saying, hearing feedback from riders once you book in the app, I'm not sure I would go back and make my feedback. So there may be a potential of people waiting at the stop or getting on the bus and while they're, you know, waiting that 1 hour for that commute or whatever, 45 minutes, that they could have a QR code and answer a quick question or like we just heard a little bit ago from spin that they have incentives that maybe you get, like a little discount or a little perk if you give us feedback, and that might help just encourage additional funding and support of the ride. Yeah, we appreciate the suggestions. Thank you. Other questions or comments? All right, well, Julia, like you said, it's been a while since I knew I came in, so thank you very much for coming. It's always good feeling, like, it's a good feeling to be connected to the work that you guys do for the region as a whole. Lots of times we're kind of in a bubble here, but it's good to be reminded that we're part of the region. So thank you again for coming and talking to us. Definitely an important part, and thank you for having me. All right, next up will be the U of M tri update, but as mentioned previously, this item will be delayed to a future meeting, hopefully not too far in the future. So then, next is the quick build survey. Review. Staff conducted a survey on impressions of the quick build projects that were deployed at various locations around the city. Survey is complete. And so Raymond will review those results. Yeah, thanks, Brad. I noticed my computer still is a little copy. I think it's trying to push an update. I see little exclamation points on the bottom core of my screen, so maybe that's if I freeze up. My apologies. Sorry. We're hearing you twice. Oh, okay. Let's see. How about anyone? Still the same problem that go. I don't know. Yeah, I think everyone should mute themselves. All right. Is that helping at all? No, no. Give me a moment and I will call in. I don't know what's happening with my computer today. It's a cool reverb, in fact, but, yeah, very hard to hear it. All right, am I coming through? Sounds good. Thank you. And no reverb. Okay. My apologies. What you may have not heard me say or heard an echo is I'm seeing there's an update on my computer, and I'm wondering if that is one of the complications of why my Internet has been a little choppy. So my apologies. Thank you for your patience. So let me go ahead and share my screen for a moment.

So my apologies. Thank you for your patience. So let me go ahead and share my screen for a moment. All right, so, as many of you know, and we've reported in past meetings, we had a series of quick build deployments that were put throughout the community last year. And one of the things we wanted to do was get impressions about how those quick build deployments were being received by the community. So, included in your packet is a report that gives background on those quick build deployments, a little refresher about where they are and what they entailed, and then also gives results from the survey. So I'm going to quickly scroll through the report and then spend a little bit of time on the survey results. So the first few pages really speak to kind of the background. They talk about the different materials that were used, and then they give a sort of photo representation of each of the locations. So, Packard and Main, Maple and Miller, state and South University, Dexter and Maple, Glenn and Fuller, Ann and fourth, and then a section along Ann between fourth and fifth. And then again, I wanted to spend time going into the actual survey results itself. So there. What was kind of interesting about our deployment in this space is we kind of use some sort of tactical urbanism to get feedback as well. We put yard signs out at the locations so that people were right standing there in front of it. They could scan a QR code and take the survey right on their phone. So again, here's a map that kind of shows all of the different locations. We asked respondents to kind of speak to which quick build they experienced and which they were speaking to, and kind of how they were experiencing the quick build as a vulnerable road user, so as a pedestrian or cyclist or as a driver themselves. So there was information on the website as well. And, you know, again, a lot of this, you can see sort of these yard signs, and the website information that people were pointed to that kind of gave an explanation of what the projects were. So we ended up getting just under 250 responses collected, and we again kind of asked what sort of experience most people had. The majority were on Liberty and stadium in North Maple, but we had a pretty good representation across all of the different quick build locations. We asked what people were, what kind of trip they were doing when they were going through the location, but really what I wanted to kind of focus in on who we heard from. So people responded again how they experienced the quick build so they could kind of count multiple forms of transportation. So 94 of the respondents experience as pedestrians, 88 as bicyclists, four as people in wheelchairs are using a mobility assisted device, 28 as bus riders, and 213 as drivers. So again, out of 240, what was it? 243, the vast majority did experience them as drivers. So the first one I wanted to hone in on was how did the quick build elements impact the following factors as you traveled? And so it's a series of a couple different questions. Did it improve your comfort of traveling? Did it affect your travel time? Did it affect the speed of others? And did it affect the behavior of others? So, combining all the results, it's kind of a mixed bag, right? So, in terms of comfort, it's kind of a wash. For some, it improved for others, it made worse. 37, 40%, respectively. Travel time. It improved travel time for only a small percentage of people at 12%, made it worse for the majority or actually did not affect the majority of respondents, but made worse for a large portion, 40%. Speed of others improved for 31%, did not affect version 42%, made worse for 27%. And then behavior is also a mixed bag in terms of being split between it improved or made worse. But I think what's kind of interesting from these results is if you look at the experience between vulnerable road users. So, again, when I use that term, speaking to pedestrians and cyclists and people in wheelchairs, you'll see that their impressions were very different than that of motorists. So in terms of comfort, it really did kind of suggest that their comfort was improved when the behavior of others, they felt the quick builds did improve the behavior of others. Speed of others indicated that it did kind of slow cars down and improve the speed of others. It only had marginal, again, kind of a wash between travel time in terms of improving the experience versus making it worse, slightly favoring not making it worse, but really did not affect the majority there. In 52%, you compare that to the driver's experience. Comfort of traveling, 45% made worse travel time, 47% made worse, affecting the speed of others. Kind of awash between improved or made worse and affecting the behavior of others. So I think that the point here is that in terms of slowing down vehicles for speed and travel time and improving the comfort of vulnerable road users, the quickbuild did sort of have the intended effect, at least based on the experience of those that responded to the survey. Then also in terms of just satisfaction, again, it's a sort of similar trend that you see in terms of satisfaction. Vulnerable road users saw the deployments of Qwik build much more favorably than that of drivers. As a matter of fact, it's almost kind of an inverse rel", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Municipality (Local Government)", "insights": [{"observation": "We had a series of quick build deployments that were put throughout the community last year.

It only had marginal, again, kind of a wash between travel time in terms of improving the experience versus making it worse, slightly favoring not making it worse, but really did not affect the majority there. In 52%, you compare that to the driver's experience. Comfort of traveling, 45% made worse travel time, 47% made worse, affecting the speed of others. Kind of awash between improved or made worse and affecting the behavior of others. So I think that the point here is that in terms of slowing down vehicles for speed and travel time and improving the comfort of vulnerable road users, the quickbuild did sort of have the intended effect, at least based on the experience of those that responded to the survey. Then also in terms of just satisfaction, again, it's a sort of similar trend that you see in terms of satisfaction. Vulnerable road users saw the deployments of Qwik build much more favorably than that of drivers. As a matter of fact, it's almost kind of an inverse relationship. 33% of vulnerable road users suggested that they were very satisfied, whereas 34% of drivers responded they were very dissatisfied. So it is just something for us to take into consideration as we move forward with these, but it kind of also shows sort of the kind of dichotomy of trying to address some of these mobility challenges within the community. And I think one of the things that I wanted to mention going forward is we did compile all the comments. So, you know, these were the main things I really wanted to highlight from the survey. Again, it's, you know, 32 pages, so you can go further down and read all of the comments that were submitted. You know, in terms of, you know, do you have any suggested locations for quick build installations? And there were other questions about just general impressions. And people shared some pretty, quite frank impressions about the deployments, and they are there for you to peruse. So we'll continue to use these sort of instruments to gauge impressions of these types of deployments, make modifications where we see that there's need for that based on the responses that we're getting and just really, you know, continuing to tweak the program. And this will just keep this in mind because the next item that I'm going to report to you will give an update on some quick builds that we're currently working on as well. So with that, I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Thanks, Raymond. Any questions? Comments? Well, thanks. The survey, I think it got some good insight, you know, that will help us moving forward in future years. So if there's no questions or comments, we'll move on to next topic, which is safe streets for all. The city received $3.8 million from US Dot last year to advance quick build projects, speed management and near miss analytics. So, rim, if you have an update on that, this is just a quick verbal update, but we're starting to move into some exciting territory. So, you know, as Brett mentioned, we received $3.8 million in grant funding from USDOT. That's matched by an additional $950,000 in local dollars for a grand total of $4.755 million worth of projects. As Brett mentioned, it's going towards three separate initiatives, quick builds, like what I just discussed. So expanding that program out, you know, the whole idea is not waiting for, you know, major capital projects to be queued up, that we can go in and with paint and posts, make some changes to hopefully address some safety concerns. Then the other is speed management program. You've heard some updates on this in the past, but for those of you who may have forgotten or are new to the commission, the speed management program is like a traffic calming toolkit for major roads and arterials. So again, think of speed humps, race intersections on a major roadway. We want to, you know, knowing that major roadways are one of our, you know, our biggest concern for serious crashes, and we know that speed being one of the primary indicators of severity of crashes, what can we do to kind of drive speeds down? So, obviously, with the funding available, we won't be able to do everything everywhere, but we want to use a couple, we want to use this grant funding to do a couple of demonstration corridors and really tee that up. And then the last one is the near miss analytics. The idea here is to, we are familiar with what is happening in crashes that are formally reported through UD. Ten crash reports that are filled out by law enforcement agencies. But what about close calls or near misses? And so we want to tap into some of our existing detection, which is camera based, run that through some post processing to be able to analyze where there might be other areas of concern that might be going underreported. So the update in this space with that background is that we have executed a contract with a consultant to help us procure and do the reporting on the near miss analytics. AECom is going to be helping us with that work. So that's very exciting. We're starting to really work up on that. We would have to procure services from a third party vendor in this space. And so AECOM understands the space a little bit better than staff does, and they're going to help us make sure that we're being very thoughtful about all the different considerations that will go into this. The other one was just due yesterday. We had an RFP for a grant administrator for this quick build and speed management program. So this is an extension of staff for someone to come in and really help us run the program. Soup to nuts. So help us with the data analysis to identify which corridors would be best suited for speed management. Help us identify where we can put those quick builds in. Make it be very data driven so that the countermeasures that we put in will address the negative behaviors that we're seeing in the crash patterns and focus in on the areas of highest concern.

So we are still analyzing those rfps, but that contract will go before council probably in about six weeks time or so. So end of June or early July, hopefully we'll have that teed up and then the work will begin in earnest. So they're just those updates that I wanted to provide because there's been some recent movements. I know for a long time we kept saying, like, we're very close to executing the grant. That took a little longer than we were expecting. It took over a year to do that. We were awarded in January of 2023, and I think it was late January of 2024 when that grant got executed. But now that that's finally all the ink is dried on it, we can start to move these projects forward. So we're very excited to do that. So with that, I'm happy to entertain any questions you might have. Again, a lot more updates will be forthcoming, but this is kind of one of the first big hurdles for us to kind of get this work going. I wanted to share that news with you all. That's all exciting news. Any questions or comments from anyone on those three initiatives? All right, then you're up again. Staff report and updates. Oh, sorry, Peter. Wait, you're still muted, Peter. Am I working off a different agenda than everyone else? Feel like I show a different agenda item here we've got regional transportation authority, then it says crash response protocol, then safe streets for all. Did I miss something? No, you're right. Let's see. Okay, yeah, that. I don't know. Chris, would that accidentally carry forward from last month? Yeah, under the crash response protocol. I'll note the attachment was the quick build final report. Okay, I think that was just the agenda heading, just to type updated. It should be the quick build survey. Okay. I mean, I. Sorry about that. I saw it on there and it was, it was meant for a follow up later on, but maybe not in this meeting. So, Brett, do we need a motion to amend the agenda, given that header, or. I don't know. What's, what's the mechanics here? Well, we. Yeah, I guess we could move to the agenda heading from crash response protocol to quick build survey review. I move. Yeah. Seconded by Lisa. All those in favor, say yes or raise your hand. Okay. I'm not sure. Yep. All those opposed, say no or raise your hand. Okay. Agenda has been modified to show that six c should be quick build survey review instead of crash response call, which is what happened in. My apologies for that oversight. That was, um. That that was. Yeah, my apologies for that oversight. No problem. And, and I was, I was working from a different modified agenda, so I didn't notice that as we were going. All right, so back to staff report and updates. Raymond. All right, so per our usual, I'll just go through changes from last month to this month on projects. So we always kind of carry forward the street resurfacing projects and sidewalk gaps. But moving forward under Miller Avenue, bids just came in yesterday. So those are still under review. We don't know yet. You know, what the recommendation is yet. We're still evaluating those. But just wanted to let you know that that project is kind of moving forward. And, you know, if there's deemed to be an acceptable bid, we'll bring that to council for their consideration. Let's see. 7th and Greenview. Construction is underway on 7th and the segment of Greenview north of Zio church and construction is expected to continue into November. Pollen, water main and resurfacing. There was some on site public engagement last weekend which will be repeated this weekend at 09:00 a.m. those are Saturdays. So for anybody interested in that project, you can go out there. There is discussion of how to incorporate an all ages and abilities bike facility because that is identified in the plan. So there's been a lot of discussion around that topic. The state trunk line jurisdictional transfer analysis. You may recall we presented this back to you in February. We weren't able to get it in front of council in short order because of just budget preparations and things like that. But we have tentatively scheduled that for June 10. They've been shared the report. You all have seen the report as well, so it is out there for the public's viewing, but they haven't had the same presentation that you've had that will happen in June. Micro mobility we discussed tonight, Office of Sustainability and Innovations continues to build out the electric vehicle charging infrastructure, including 13 dual port level two chargers at the Ann Arbor Senior centers here on Hills Golf Course, Leslie Park Golf Course, Fuller park and Veterans Memorial park. You just heard the safe streets for all updates. So I don't need to tell you about that bike parking. You heard me touch on a little bit of this earlier, but to expand on what I said, the DDA is also looking at kind of updating their downtown bike parking strategy. So they have released an RFP for a consultant to help with that strategy and the updated inventory for downtown park facilities.

Downtown bike parking facilities is part of that strategy and we are in coordination with them on that. Carbon reduction program grants. So again, one of the big projects that we've been working on, working with DTE and others is to take all of the DTE streetlights and convert them to led for energy efficiency sake, which is an identified carbon reduction strategy in the 820 plan. So we did get some grant funding from SemcoG. We're moving that forward. We're currently in negotiations with DTE on what that could look like, and we hope to bring something to council in June for their consideration. And then lastly, we are continuing to work through different departments and such to get everybody up to speed on the vision zero plan. So again, that it's just, you know, everybody at the city is in lockstep on this. So we're holding departmental specific meetings with streets and signs and signals. So those are coming up. And then today was bike to wherever day and there were 20 stations that you could visit for goodies and to show support. So we want to thank the sponsors, especially walk by Washtenaw, which took the lead on the event this year. And, you know, we were happy partners in that initiative. So, you know, again, thank you to everybody who participated, stopped by stations and to the station hosts as well. And with that, I'm finished and I'm happy to take any questions you might have. Questions? All right, now the adds on reports. Any commissioners who specifically serve as a liaison to another body or organization are invited to provide brief reports or updates. Do we have any tonight yet? Matt? Thank you, mister chair. Just a real quick note, we're very happy to. The ride is happy to begin delivering services that voters voted for in the 2022 millage. We rolled out the Ypsilanti Ann Arbor Express bus. Route 104 started operating a week or so back. Ridership's already up to about 300 a day, so growing pretty quickly. We're happy about that. Cuts travel time between the two communities by about a third, so we're pretty happy with that. That's the only report to make at this time. Anyone else? All right, next up, commission member communications. All commissioners are invited to provide reports or updates. Yes, Raymond. Yes. Oh, good. Oh, my goodness. There we go. Sorry, I unmuted the wrong thing. I did want to make an announcement. I have submitted my resignation to the city of Ann Arbor, and this will be my last transportation commission meeting. I do want to take this opportunity to thank the commission members for their dedication to transportation and transportation safety. It truly is a remarkable group of dedicated residents, and I thank you for your time. It really is. I appreciate the conversation. I appreciate the direction you provide to not only us, but the policymakers at the city, and your work is very important. So thank you for the opportunity to, and the honor to have served you for the past six years. The decision was difficult. There were a lot of things I had to consider. But one of the things that made it a little bit easier is that I get to continue to do progressive transportation projects within the community and within the county because I am going over to the ride to work and help them on capital projects. So it's a very exciting opportunity. I like to think that while, like, for example, Nick, my boss, who I hate to leave behind, while he might be losing a coworker, he's gaining a friend and a partner at a different agency. And so hopefully you can think of it the same way that you have a friend at the ride. I'm sure you have plenty of friends at the ride already, but you have another one. So obviously, the transition will take some time, and I do ask for your patience during that transition. You know, there are obviously some things we need to do in terms of how we transition roles and responsibilities related to this commission, to make sure that there aren't mistakes made like we posting wrong agendas, and that's my fault. So, hey, there might be some operational improvements there, so there's room for improvement, and hopefully you'll be the benefactor of that. So, anyway, I did want to let you know all of that. Again, I thank you all for. For your dedication to this commission, dedication to the city, and dedication to transportation safety in general. And again, thank you for the opportunity to serve you. Ray. Mindy, I. You've been a superstar this whole, the existence of the commission. And, you know, so much of what has been achieved in this is. So you've provided not just guide, expertise, ideas, but, you know, especially the last year or two, the amount of execution and seeing all of these initiatives and the vision zero plan moving forward is just so much of it is attributed directly to you. So, you know, very proud of you. Should be very proud of what you've done and accomplished. And I didn't know you were going to AAA Ta. I think that's awesome.

We did update our work plan for 2024 and 2025 again. Seems very weird to be talking about this after getting that news. So I'm sorry. Wish I would have went before. Raymond, two things that I wanted to bring to transportation's awareness is tc one, Washtenaw corridor is in process right now at council's request. So we do expect that to come through planning commission around June, July ish. I think June is kind of the time for frame for looking at wasH and offer TC one, the transportation review criteria that is updating our code to include not just kind of like vehicular traffic analysis, but multimodal transit analysis. And so that is intended to create UD. It's updating the unified development code to kind of looking at the holistic impact of development on transportation. We are also scheduled to look, continue looking at drive throughs. The other one that I think is going to really be of interest is as we go through the comprehensive plan. The comp plan is slated to be. We're still well underway. We're anticipating completion in 25. One of the items that's going to be implemented into the unified development code is going to be parking maximum. So as you may be aware, we minimize or we eliminated parking minimums. So no developments require any parking, you know, just what they actually propose. But that we are going to be looking at capping or looking to revise the parking maximums moving forward. So other things that we have are post comp plan against. So this will be in 25. Looking into 2026 will be a corridor design standards, pedestrian connectivity between and among private developments, climate resiliency. But again, I think the parking maximums, corridor design standards and pedestrian connectivity are ones primarily of concern for this particular body, again, looking at 25, 26 for those items, but of more kind of on the current horizon, is going to be washtenaw corridor TC one, the transportation review criteria. I think that's already at council, if it hasn't already been approved. It already went through first reading May 6, and it'll probably come back in June's meeting for final adoption. So those are the updates from the planning commission side of things. So. But again, Raymond, we're going to miss you. Sorry, I'm kind of like. Oh, shit. Oh, excuse my language. Multimodal transportation impact analysis passed at last. City council. That is code now. Thank you. Oh, yep, sorry, my notes at second reading, it was the bylaws chapter that was on May 6. Oh, thank you. Thank you for that correction. So, material correction, the transportation review criteria is now part of the unified development code and should be adopted here with the updated version here in the coming weeks. So with that, we'll miss you very much, Raymond, but try to come visit you and matt sometime. So thank you for all of your service. Thank you. Thanks again. Yeah. All right, let's move on to call for agenda items. Raymond, if you would review the existing work plan and some previously requested agenda items. Yeah. So we will follow up with Doctor Jim Sayre to see if he is able to join us in June for his Umtree update. I don't know if the traffic homing petitions, some of those are nearing their final stages, so some of those are ready. They might come back. We did promise you a winter maintenance update, so we are waiting to see what happens with the budget. I think I mentioned this last time. So the budget is going to city council next week, so we might have some updates about really what the plan is going forward as also looking back. And then the annual review of bylaws is out there as well. That is an annual thing that we do. So those are the items we're tracking. And we also haven't lost sight of the crash response protocol as well. Something that we're tracking and trying to come up with some strategies on. All right. As always, please email any other agenda topic ideas to myself, Megan, Raymond, and anyone else, Chris, Christopher, of course. All right. Well, the. Oh, yeah, yeah. One question about agenda. Will the maple or, sorry, will the Miller improvements come back to this body? Like, I think we had discussion on the preliminary, you know, designer ideas, but we didn't actually vote on anything. And then I think we heard in this meeting that it's out for bid, but yeah. So is Miller going to come back at all? With, like, a final designer plan, or did I miss something? I think we can. We can give you an update on it.

So delighted to have you all here today. Mister Dahoni, you have the con. Amaze us. Well, good. Good evening. Merritt. Counsel. I guess the first amazing thing I could tell you is, as you can see, we spent about $50,000 on new clocks. So that you all won't be complaining anymore about the time and it won't be spinning. So it's all good. We're delighted to have the opportunity to be here with you this evening. This is year two of the biennial budget. So, as you know, we rolled this out last year. And so by design, it would be highly irregular if there were major, major changes to year two. So I'll just tell you now, there's not. We have modified the way that we put the budget together, and the changes that we made in process, we are going to institutionalize. Prior to this year, the process was really a paper flow exercise. People filled out a whole bunch of pieces of paper, went through a lot of process, and ultimately coming into the administrator's office for some kind of decision on the proposed budget. This year, we all went to cobblestone in person. I felt it was important for service areas to hear what their colleagues needs were. Important for all of us to have more of a global understanding of what our challenges are. That process did influence the flow of the budget because some people, upon hearing the global needs of the government, backed off on some things that they were requesting because they saw kind of where we were, what our priorities are. The presentations that you'll hear tonight will include eight people. Missy is away this week, so you won't hear from OSI. The staff may be a bit anxious when you hear from them because they do not yet know what's actually in the budget. They only know what they asked for. I can tell you point blank that not everything you hear tonight will be in the budget. That is mathematically impossible. We have this many needs. We have this much money. Our job is to make sure that it is balanced. And Marty and I were meeting today still in the throes of trying to put the budget all the way together, because it's got to be all the way balanced. You will get a presentation on April 15 from me. That will be the actual proposed budget. We just got our marijuana excise tax number within the past couple of weeks. In round numbers, it's about 125,000 more than it was a year prior, which says, any notion that we have that that's going to be a revenue stream that takes off, we just need to rethink that because we've extended hours. It's just not making that much of a difference materially in terms of the big picture. We ask that you hold your questions until everybody has presented and then we will do our q and a process tonight. But we'll also when we get to the actual budget in a month, we'll use the same process as we used before. We'd like you to submit your questions about the budget in writing. We like for them to come to Sarah, Marty, Kim, Busselmeter and myself. We will formulate all of those. Sarah will send out a report every Friday. These are the questions we got this week. Here's what the answers are. So everyone will see every question that gets asked and you'll see every answer that we gave. There was a little bit of confusion last year. We'll try to keep that to a minimum this year in that starting to pose questions after tonight. You can do that, but you haven't heard the budget. You're only hearing what people have requested consideration for, and you're also hearing what's on our horizon in the next two to three years. We felt like it is important for you to have a view of that so that our needs are clear and you'll understand the efforts that we're taking to generate more revenue to cover some of the needs that we have. So with that, Marty can come up. She will be our first presenter and everyone else will just flow after her. Good evening. I have the pleasure this evening of kicking off our discussion by covering our fiscal year 25 budget plan and fiscal outlook. I'll begin by quickly covering some process reminders as well as our budget calendar. You'll see that we start out this evening by hearing from various units on the updates to our originally presented plan as well as horizon issues. Then we move on to April 15, where Mister Dohoney will present his recommended budget to council. In addition, council will hear first reading of ordinance changes that are required for our utility rate updates. Then on May 6, we'll hold public hearings required for the budget ordinance and fee changes, and on that same evening, we'll conduct second readings on ordinance and rate changes that all culminates on the evening of May 20, when city council will consider and adopt the fiscal year 25 budget as well as the related fee changes that coincide with that budget.

Simultaneously, each year, an operating budget and capital budget are adopted, the budget that is brought forward to council for consideration incorporates council policies, staff expertise, as well as public input. The major policies we adhere to recommending a budget to council include those listed here on the slide as well as some others. On the evening of May 20, it takes seven votes of council to adopt the budget and only six votes required to amend the recommended budget on that evening, whereas an adopted budget during the fiscal year will require eight votes of council to amend. If the presented budget is not approved by council on May 20, Mister Dahoni's recommended budget goes into effect. The city does not adopt a line item budget. We adopt a budget by fund in total, with the exception of the general fund, where we adopt a budget by service area or what we internally refer to as agency. It is typical each year. At the last meeting of the fiscal year, the second meeting in June, city council considers a budget amendment to address unanticipated expenses that happen during the year to ensure compliance with state law. Next, I'll provide you some financial background that may be helpful as we develop strategies going forward. Listed in the left hand column of this slide, you'll see the city millages that are being levied. Overall, we have authorization to levy up to 23 mills and we currently are levying just under 21 and a half mils, leaving a levying capacity of just over one and a half mils. As a point of reference, a mill in fiscal year 24 generated $7.1 million. The right hand column on the slide will reflect what the city is currently levying due to the Hedley rollback, which requires local governments to reduce its millage levy when annual growth on existing property exceeds the rate of inflation. Our total tax levy for the current fiscal year was 17.7 mills. Currently, the city holds over $273 million in debt. The largest debt category of 116 million is the revolving loan category. Revolving loans are a state run program that we are able to take advantage of that offers advantageous financing options for the city. For most of the past decade, for our utility enterprises, we've utilized a state run program. Instead of going to market on our own, it's a cheaper option for the city. Going to market for bonds can be a quite expensive endeavor. Next, we have 97 million in general obligation bonds that includes debt that we incur for capital improvements. Some examples would include the court's PD facility, the Wheeler maintenance facility, and most recently, the road bonds that we issued. The graph on the right hand side of the slide represents when that existing debt will roll off, and you'll notice within 15 years, the majority of our debt will come off the books next up, we'll go over the assumptions that we assumed in the budget plan and the reasoning behind those assumptions. Over 50% of the general fund revenue is generated from real and personal property taxes. We are forecasting to generate $76 million. That includes a 6% increase for fiscal year 25. Thereafter, for fiscal years 26 through 29, we're forecasting a 3% increase each year. As you may recall from the previous slide that we discussed on the millage capacity legislation is in place that limits the local government on growth. We are limited to a 5% cap on existing property plus new development. When we incorporate the anticipated additions and losses as forecasted by our assessing department, we are projecting that 6% increase resulting in an additional $3.2 million. We'll talk more about our revenue, tax value and revenue on the next slide up, so we'll just move on to our next largest revenue category, which is state shared revenue. That revenue is estimated to account for $13 million in fiscal year 24. I'm sorry, 25 and that comes in in two distinctive categories, either constitutional or statutory. The constitutional portion is the larger of the two and that is allowed by Michigan's constitution and is our share of Michigan's 6% sales tax that accounts for $11 million of the $13 million we are projecting. We are benefiting from some increased state allocations in fiscal year 25, therefore increasing our projections to 25% for that fiscal year. We're then projecting to maintain relatively flat for 26 through 29. On the status story side, that program is also previously known as CVTRs or city village tax revenue sharing. It's a supplemental program that is available to local agencies who meet eligibility requirements. The city meets those requirements and we strive to do so, and that generates an additional approximately $2 million. We are then projecting to increase that 3% each year annually. After that, our overall economy and the city's state shared revenue is dependent on consumer spending. Although spending has remained strong through the inflationary period, we are seeing signs that spending is slowing, consumer debt has significantly increased and af", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Utility Enterprises", "insights": [{"observation": "For most of the past decade, for our utility enterprises, we've utilized a state-run revolving loan program instead of going to market on our own, as it's a cheaper option for the city.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City", "insights": [{"observation": "The city does not adopt a line-item budget.

It's a supplemental program that is available to local agencies who meet eligibility requirements. The city meets those requirements and we strive to do so, and that generates an additional approximately $2 million. We are then projecting to increase that 3% each year annually. After that, our overall economy and the city's state shared revenue is dependent on consumer spending. Although spending has remained strong through the inflationary period, we are seeing signs that spending is slowing, consumer debt has significantly increased and affordability is becoming an issue. Interest rates remain high, and stimulus and Covid savings have been exhausted. Therefore, we are remaining cautiously optimistic in revenue forecasting. Finally, on the revenue side, we are continuing to forecast a rebound of parking revenue, and we're estimating a 16% increase for fiscal year 25. For the remainder of the five year plan, we're estimating a 3% increase for each year. As promised, this slide represents our taxable value and revenue history. Our general operating tax revenue is represented by the blue bars on the slide and if you refer to the left axis here, you'll see that our revenue stream has seen modest growth year over year of about two to 6%. However, when you compare 2016 at 52.5 million to fiscal year 25, seven or fiscal year 24, sorry, $73 million, that represents a significant increase to the revenue stream. The orange line on the chart represents the net percentage increase in taxable value, which includes growth and losses. So if you refer to the access on the vertical axis on the right hand of the slide, you'll see the percentage increase. So in fiscal year 22, what we're not seeing is a decrease of taxable value, but a decrease in the change from the previous year. So in fiscal years 20 and 21 we saw increases of 6% and 5% respectively, and those were as a result of developments coming online. But then in 22 we saw a decrease in the growth rate and we were down to a 3% growth rate. So we are forecasting the growth rate to continue to grow, mostly due to inflation, but it does indeed include some new developments. So in addition to new development, we also experience things that come off the tax roll. So if a property comes off the tax roll cause it's purchased by a non taxable entity, or in the event there are legislative changes that occurred, like that occurred in 2023 in which the personal property exemption cap was increased, so we can no longer collect as much tax on personal property as we have previously. Now, moving on to the expenditure side of the plan, we are experiencing labor and benefit increases that not only impact our internal costs, but also our other charges and contracted services. We're projecting a 2.6% increase in fiscal year 25 for personnel and a 3% each year thereafter on fringes, 8.7 for fiscal year 25 and then a total of 6.8 between 26 and 29. As we move on to other services and contracted work, we're projecting a 8.69 increase for fiscal year 25 and 3.7 for the next three year period. We still are experiencing supply chain issues and contractor capacity issues that are driving some prices in those areas. As we take a look at the overall financial picture, the top portion of the slide represents our forecasted recurring revenue and expenditures. And you'll see in fiscal year 25 we're in a good situation where recurring revenue is exceeding recurring expenditures. However, using the assumptions that we discussed on the previous slide, by fiscal year 27, we are then in a situation where our recurring operational expenses are exceeding our operational revenues. This is a situation we'll be looking to solve for in subsequent cycle and cautions us from adding any recurring expenditures without appropriate revenue offsets or reduction in expenditures. On the bottom of section of the slide, you see the one time revenue and expenditures which are possible because in fiscal year 25 we have exceeding recurring revenues. However, we still then have to stay in compliance with our fund balance policy which is the 15% to 20% of recurring expenditures in the general fund as a credit to the financial team, past and present. The city is in good financial shape and it's reflected in these key performance measures. Each year, our financial statements as well as our financial practices are audited with a goal of no material weaknesses which we have a record of achieving. There is only one level above double a plus for bond ratings that we have currently in wastewater and general obligation. Therefore, we are able to issue debt at the most favorable financial situation. As we discussed on the previous slide, matching recurring revenue and expenditures are a sign of financial health and oversight therefore is an important component of our annual budget process. In addition to maintaining our fund balance to comply with established policy. It is a key sign of financial discipline and health. And you'll see here that each year we are reporting above our required minimum fund balance. However, that typically we typically are actually running right around 20%. It's really a reflection of timing the expenditures cross fiscal years.

Therefore, we are able to issue debt at the most favorable financial situation. As we discussed on the previous slide, matching recurring revenue and expenditures are a sign of financial health and oversight therefore is an important component of our annual budget process. In addition to maintaining our fund balance to comply with established policy. It is a key sign of financial discipline and health. And you'll see here that each year we are reporting above our required minimum fund balance. However, that typically we typically are actually running right around 20%. It's really a reflection of timing the expenditures cross fiscal years. And finally, our pension and retiree healthcare rate funding ratios are considered excellent and very healthy and they are attributable to the city's funding policies on those plans and the diligent oversight of the pension board. My presentation this evening has focused mainly on the general fund. However, I'll end with a couple of comments on a few of our enterprise funds. As part of our annual budget process, we go through similar financial processes for each fund. In the case of the utility funds, the process generates a rate plan which typically requires an annual adjustment. This cycle, we plan to remain within the plan we shared with you last year, which will result in user rate increases that you will consider for 6% for water, 3% for sanitary sewer and 3% for stormwater. Our next presenter, Brian Steglitz, public services area administrator, will discuss further plan in these areas. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening. Thank you. As Miss Prasan said, I will go through the public services area budget impacts and horizon issues. I will start with the budget impacts. Before I start, I would like to recognize the public services area team who is here tonight to support me to answer all of your difficult questions, which we'll be hearing about later on in the evening. I heard from one of our unit managers who said that they haven't been in council chambers in several years, so I'm very happy to have provided that opportunity to them tonight. So I'll start with the general fund. We have two budget impacts of note for fiscal year 25. The first is to do a condition assessment at Barton damage. You've probably seen, we've been talking a lot about Barton Dam, and there's a project that will be coming before you shortly to do some repairs that's currently out to bid on some of the embankment. But we haven't really addressed yet the structural concrete issues at the dam. The dam was built in the early 19 hundreds. And if you can see in this picture, that's a picture of the sidewall of the hydro facility. And is this cursor work okay? Yes, you can see over here there are these bars that are exposed. So those are structural rebar, which is part of the integrity of the wall. So as part of our last five year safety inspection that's done by the regulator, they've identified these things as things that we need to investigate. Hence the request to do the assessment in this coming fiscal year. The cost of the assessment is about $120,000. So this is half of it. Funding of the work that happens at Barton Dam is split between the water fund and the general fund, because the dam provides power, which is part of the general fund, which takes the revenue from the power generation, and then the water fund, because the impoundment provides the impoundment for the city's water supply. So you'll see that on my water fund slide, where you'll see the additional 60,000. The other item I identified here is support for art fair. Do a lot of things to help make sure art fair is successful. The city does, and the associations that lead, that have asked for some support based on some of the expenses that's incurred, that are typically reimbursed by the art fair. So we're asking consideration from council to support art fair in the amount of 25,000. Well, that's a one time ask. We would anticipate that it would likely become a recurring request from the associations, but it's part of this budget request. It's just for fiscal year 25. Moving on to the engineering fund. Private development. This is the one area in public services where we're seeking an additional FTE. That FTE is to support our plan review process. We have currently have a pretty substantial backlog of private development plan reviews, and we also anticipate a lot more coming down the road. We are currently supporting one FTE full time contract support person from a consulting firm to help us maintain the backlog. So this would be able to provide some offset to actually the consulting services that we're using to provide those services. Currently in the water fund, we have three items. The first one is the other half of the condition assessment of the concrete work at Barton Dam. The next item is $275,000 for water system repair parts. So these are things like hydrants, valves, service connections and appurtenances we use for doing work in the water system. We have in our base budget that has been approved as part of the two year budget cycle. We already have $500,000 allotted for this item. So this is in addition to what is identified in our current budget. And the rationale for it is primarily one inflation. We've seen significant cost increases in some of these components and also when we're doing a lot of the engineering work, replacing water mains as part of engineering projects that we have throughout the city, we like to get ahead of those and replace some of this infrastructure to make sure that we're set up for success. So that might be replacing valves that we're not sure are going to work beforehand to make sure we can get good shutdowns, that type of work. And this is what this, this request will fund. And then the third item is water distribution system model and plan. This plan has already come before council and was approved, but it will be coming out of an additiona", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City's Utility Funds", "insights": [{"observation": "This cycle, we plan to remain within the plan we shared with you last year, which will result in user rate increases that you will consider for 6% for water, 3% for sanitary sewer and 3% for stormwater.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "In the case of the utility funds, the process generates a rate plan which typically requires an annual adjustment.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City's Pension Fund", "insights": [{"observation": "Our pension and retiree healthcare rate funding ratios are considered excellent and very healthy and they are attributable to the city's funding policies on those plans and the diligent oversight of the pension board.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Barton Dam", "insights": [{"observation": "The dam was built in the early 1900s, and the structural concrete issues at the dam need to be addressed.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "As part of our last five-year safety inspection that's done by the regulator, they've identified these things as things that we need to investigate.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Funding of the work that happens at Barton Dam is split between the water fund and the general fund.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Art Fair", "insights": [{"observation": "Support for Art Fair: The city does a lot of things to help make sure the Art Fair is successful.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Public Services Area", "insights": [{"observation": "This is the one area in public services where we're seeking an additional FTE to support our plan review process.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We are currently supporting one FTE full-time contract support person from a consulting firm to help us maintain the backlog.

So that might be replacing valves that we're not sure are going to work beforehand to make sure we can get good shutdowns, that type of work. And this is what this, this request will fund. And then the third item is water distribution system model and plan. This plan has already come before council and was approved, but it will be coming out of an additional ask for the water fund for fiscal year 25. I did want to mention that all of these additional fund requighted impacts would be captured in the the increases that Miss Prishan talked about previously during her presentation. So this wouldn't require additional rate increases for any of the utility funds. The next one is the stormwater fund. Stormwater comprehensive plan. This plan was part of our budget request for the two year budget. But we are, from a logistical standpoint, a little behind schedule. So what we're seeking to do is to flip flop the FY 24 and FY 25 funding allowances for this project. So this would allow us to make the project whole in fiscal year 25 an additional 166,000. That's 166,000 that we won't be spending in fiscal year 24. So it's really just the moving of funds from one fiscal year to the next. And then the third is the sanitary fund. This is an initiating project that wasn't identified in the previous budget, two year budget cycle. It's about a $500,000 project. So it's over two fiscal years. The first fiscal year is 350,000. And what you'll see when I talk about horizon issues a little later on in the presentation. We're working on doing some comprehensive planning in all three funds you saw the water distribution, the sanitary and the storm. And we're finding that we have a real need in order to make sure that we can stay ahead of what we may be seeing in terms of development in some of these areas. And when you'll hear from Mister Fournier later to talk about economic development and incentivizing growth in the city. We need to make sure that utilities are well positioned to be able to handle that. And that's the rationale for moving this project forward. Moving on to the streets funds. We have two funds that we'll be discussing, the majors and the locals. On the majors. We have some vehicle replacements. This has already come before you, so it's more of a refresher. The 1.4 million to replace several vehicles as part of our public works fleet. Vehicles will be coming out of the right of way. Maintenance that is budgeted at seven and a half million. So 1.4 million of the seven and a half million has already now been dedicated towards those vehicle replacements. The next item is road diet evaluations. This came from a council directive for us to come up with a plan to evaluate road diets on majors before 2030. We've identified a four year plan to do that. This is the funding we would requests for year one. You can see it's 150,000. We already have $100,000 in the budget, so this will just augment that to be able to handle what we think we need in year one to do that evaluation. That 150,000 would be programmed to come out of our capital maintenance budget, which is established at 650,000 and that's used for things like crack sealing on major roads. So we'll be doing a little less of that in order to accommodate this request by council and then on the locals. We have $500,000 in traffic calming. We have $250,000 budgeted for traffic calming initiatives in the county mental health millage that gets allocated for this purpose. The additional 500,000 would allow us to get caught up with the backlog of ones that have already been evaluated that you've seen, and now we need to do implementation of. So this will help us move forward. We're struggling with the backlog. There's a lot of demand for this program. So that's going to be something I'll talk a little bit about on horizon. Issues that we need to be thinking about a funding source for that in the future. If it's something that we're going to continue to support for this year, in fiscal year 25, we would propose the $500,000 to come out of the fund balance from resurfacing. So this is some balance that hasn't been used from a previous year that's now available. So it's important to note that when we're doing these types of initiatives, the size of the pie is fixed. So if we're doing more of one thing like traffic con, then we have to take it away from something. And in this case, it would be doing some road resurfacing. So there's sort of that natural tension between different multiple priorities, and it would take almost half of what the balance is that exists in the resurfacing fund from the previous year. Moving on to the solid waste fund, we have three vehicle replacements that are due right now. We're actually struggling with keeping some of our fleet in service, and that helps. That really is a service delivery issue for us. So this is a pretty important priority in order to get these vehicles replaced. So that's an important ask. The next one is route optimization software for our solid waste vehicles. We haven't done looked at the routes in over a decade. We've had a fair bit of growth, and this also provides us an opportunity to look at efficiencies. So if we can optimize the routes, there's an opportunity to potentially reduce equipment costs and potentially overtime for the folks who are working on those routes.

So if we can optimize the routes, there's an opportunity to potentially reduce equipment costs and potentially overtime for the folks who are working on those routes. So we think it's good investment in order to get current with what the current service area that we are serving. And then the third item is some temporary staff to help support our fall compost collection. I think that's pretty self explanatory, but obviously, when we have all of the bags put out, help having some temporary staff to help us get through the routes, which is really difficult to get through during the compost season, we're typically working, you know, over. Having the additional staff support there helps us become more efficient and get done within the appropriate amount of time. At the city administrator's request, we have taken a look with our Publix works team about, you know, how can we improve our response to snow removal. We know that that was a sensitive issue for a lot of you and your constituents. This winter, we've had a couple challenging storms to deal with. So in this budget request for next year, we're asking for an additional $500,000 to do a few things one is to use contract services to help support some of the work that we're doing, particularly in the local areas. I think, as you all know, we're focusing primarily when we're doing snow removal on the majors and the safe routes to school, so the locals tend to trail this contract assistance would allow us to have a contractor work in the local areas while we're working on the majors and help us get in that space faster. And we think that would improve our response. We also are proposing to look at additional salting on local roads. So this is something that we have the capacity to do. The cost really is for the additional media that we'd be using the salt. There is an environmental impact to this. So it's something that we want to be intentional about if this is something that we want to do, but we did want to raise it as an option for consideration. And the third item is to use contract support to help address right of ways and refuge islands. This is something that right now, parks is helping us to support. So if we were contracting this out, that would free up some of their staff to work on things that they need to be doing, which is being getting the parks cleared and the paths cleared. So we think that is an appropriate use of resources, is to contract some of that out. And then the last item, which I know, I've heard a lot from council about, is looking at how we can keep vehicles off the streets so we can be more efficient at getting the streets cleared. So we're working, and I think some of you are also working with legal on what that would look like. But we do have the ability to implement emergency conditions where we can ban cars from parking on the street, alternate day street parking. So there's a lot of different options that we'll be looking at and that we'll bring forth for your consideration to implement next winter. There really wouldn't be a material cost to that, but we would want to make sure that there was adequate enforcement in order to make sure that it's effective in the absence. I know I'm not nearly as dynamic as Nisi, but I'm going to give you my best here. But the municipal energy utility. So this is a request in the budget to do the phase two study to get an appraisal of DCT assets. We estimate that could cost upwards of seven figures will be. This would be an important step if the community at some point decides to bring a ballot initiative together to look at moving forward with the formation or the exploration of public energy utility for Ann Arbor. So this is a step that we've identified to be included in the fiscal year 25 budget for your consideration. So those are the budget impacts. Now I will quickly move on to the horizon issues. So I talked about the structural issues at the dams. We have four dams I think you're familiar with. They were all built in the early 19 hundreds. We're facing some similar issues at all of them. Some of the challenges that we have. Well, two of the dams are funded by portion of the general fund, are two that have hydropower. But the other two dams, Gettys and Argo, are currently funded by Parks Millage. And there's a tension there because the money that we tend to use for the dams takes away from the important things that we need to do in the parks. So that's going to be a horizon issue that we think that we're going to need to discuss as the needs for the dams are going to become greater as they age, and they're not cheap, as you can imagine. So figuring out a funding source so we can make sure that we can sustainably keep the dams in good repair and also be able to maintain parks at the service level that our community expects is going to be an important issue for us to consider down the road. Apologize for the fuzzy picture here, but this is a picture of Getty's dam, which has the old Dicksboro Road going over it, and then the new Dixboro Road, which is the elevated one. So these are both owned and operated by the Washtenaw County Road Commission.

But the other two dams, Gettys and Argo, are currently funded by Parks Millage. And there's a tension there because the money that we tend to use for the dams takes away from the important things that we need to do in the parks. So that's going to be a horizon issue that we think that we're going to need to discuss as the needs for the dams are going to become greater as they age, and they're not cheap, as you can imagine. So figuring out a funding source so we can make sure that we can sustainably keep the dams in good repair and also be able to maintain parks at the service level that our community expects is going to be an important issue for us to consider down the road. Apologize for the fuzzy picture here, but this is a picture of Getty's dam, which has the old Dicksboro Road going over it, and then the new Dixboro Road, which is the elevated one. So these are both owned and operated by the Washtenaw County Road Commission. The old Dicksboro Road used to go all the way through it, crossed the train tracks. Now it dead ends there, so you can't go all the way through, really. The old Dixboro Road bridge now serves two purposes. One is to provide access to Gallup park because there's a trail on the other side, and the other is to help service the dam. So we use it to do to maintain the dam and the infrastructure associated with it, such as the gates. That bridge has been deteriorating. The Washtenaw County Road Commission doesn't have resources to invest in keeping it in good repair. They've recently derated it and they put jersey barriers. So now it's a single lane bridge as opposed to a two lane bridge. And that's their strategy moving forward. That in the long run is not going to work for the city because we need to maintain the load rating to enable us to do the work that we need to do. Like if we had to get a crane out there, which we had to do several years ago, when we had a gate failure. So we were going to be investigating, you know, what does that mean for the city? They would like us to take ownership over it. They say they'll give us a really, really good price. I think they'll just give it to us, actually. And that would be a liability that we would be incurring in the long run. And based on the current funding for the Gettys dam, the bridge would also likely at this current state, be funded by the Parks millage, which would be another challenge for parks. So we need to look at this in the long run and figure out what our strategy is. We are going to have to take ownership of that. And again, something, it's a horizon issue that we'll need to explore on solid waste. So a few items there. One is a drop off station. I think you all know it's something that we're working on. We're hoping to bring something to you for your consideration over the coming months. We've been working with a consultant and our partners, including recycle Ann Arbor, to come up with what we think financially sustainable solution is for having a drop off station serve the region. Because this would be not just an Ann Arbor facility, but a regional facility. So it's something that we're working on. But we want also, the reason I'm raising this as a horizon issue is solid waste is a single millage. And we keep on asking more of it. We know that we want to expand our circular economy. We want to potentially consider growing commercial composting these services and all of them will cost additional resources. We know we're exploring right now when we do move out for the University of Michigan. Michigan, which will be happening soon, having some circular economy components there. So we're not just throwing everything away. Unfortunately, it's a lot cheaper to just throw everything away. But if we want to explore opportunities like this, then we're going to have to figure out how we're going to be able to fund them. And there's a lot of tension and pull on solid waste right now to do all these different things on the street funds. I think last year we put in about 12 miles of bicycle lanes and we're anticipated to do maybe five more miles this year. We've been able to absorb that with our current staff. We have basically one person who's dedicated to dealing with keeping them clean and maintaining the bike facilities. As we continue to add more, that's going to put some stress on our streets. Funds from a maintenance standpoint. And at some point you'll see. When I talk about future staff needs, possibly another FTE need. When we add little bits at a time, it doesn't necessarily, each individual item doesn't require the need for another FTE, but at some point you reach the tipping point. We're approaching the tipping point. Also on the streets funds, I talked about resurfacing versus competing needs. We know we have a road bond. We know we have a really strong community feel for getting the roads in good condition and getting our pacer ratings up. And we're working aggressively to try to move that forward as best we can. But there's other demands, like pedestrian safety that will compete against those funds. So that's going to be a challenge. That tension in the future is if we want to really advance our resurfacing needs, then it could impact how much we can do in some of these other areas. So something that we'll need to be continuing to talk about with you all and then the trunk line study. We know this is, I think there will be a council work session on this coming up over the course of the next few months. But this is basically the city taking over ownership of some or all of the MDOT trunk lines that go through the city. There's a lot of benefit to the city for taking control of it, but there's a fairly substantial cost, and you'll see that in the study. The state shared revenue that we get and the condition that the trunk lines will be delivered to the city in likely wouldn't be sustainable financially with our current funding model.

We would have to be stealing resources from other things in order to keep those new trunk lines maintained. So you don't get enough when the ownership is transferred over to you from MDOT in order to meet what we think the city's expectations of condition for those are. So it's going to, we'll have, I'm sure, a robust conversation about that, but that's a horizon issue, will need to be discussed discussing for the utility fund. So on the water side, you know, I think you're quite familiar with this because we just came to you for approval of the water strategic plan. But we're in the year like think this, this greenish color where, uh oh. And the treatment recommendations. So 23, 24, that's where we're evaluating right now. We will be continuing. Our pilot plant is up and running. We're still working out some bugs. But over the course of the next year, we intend to get a lot of good data that will help inform the decisions that we need to make. In terms of what does the rehabilitation of the water treatment look like for the next several generations? So that's really what you'll be seeing over the course of the next year. Utility system capacity analyses, those are the three analyses that I mentioned on our three different utilities. Those are going to be really important. Historically, we've taken the position where we don't really augment the system. We require developers to pay for what it costs to build the capacity to serve them. If we were going to be serious as a community about incentivizing economic development, do we want to be ahead of that? We need to be sensitive about what bolt allows us to do in terms of making investments in the system and how that cost gets distributed amongst our ratepayers. But what we're finding with some of the developments that we've been seeing that are large, particularly on the sanitary side, where there's not sufficient capacity to serve some of these new developments, the cost, it really becomes a barrier to get into the city and build because the costs are so substantial to improve the system, to be able to accommodate. So probably an appropriate conversation to be having is there, do we want to be thinking about making some investments so we're more friendly to allow folks who want to develop to be able to get in? And the capacity exists because in some of these cases, the capacity could take years for us to build, and that might not meet the timeline for people who want to come and invest in the city. So definitely a horizon issue. And that sort of ties into the economic development and zoning change that we've been discussing on the water system. So two figures here, and I'm getting close on the water mains by decade, installed. So the one on the bottom, you'll see that there's sort of a big hump, and that's in the 1940s, fifties, sixties timeline, where most of our buried infrastructure was built. And unfortunately, when you do the math and you look at what the life expectancy of that is, you'll see a big hump in the, which we're just starting. So we, in order to, you know, stay sort of current and replace the infrastructure at the right time, we have a big investment that we're going to be making, and this is in the drinking water buried infrastructure over the course of the next couple decades. And we're right at the beginning of it now. We haven't been replacing things at the right rate in order for us to, for this to be sustainable. And as you see, as we get to the 2040s, you know, we're talking about almost 50% of the buried infrastructure in the city is going to be reaching the end of its life over the next couple of decades. We can't do that all in ten years or 20 years. Not only would it just be hugely disruptive to the community, but we don't have the financial resources either. So we need to come up with a strategy to address this in a prioritized manner and to make sure that we are able to. And this is not unique to Ann Arbor. This is facing. Utilities all over the country are facing the same thing because there's a lot of growth in the post war eras. So the time, though, to start thinking about and planning for it is now. So on staffing, I've mentioned private development. The FTE that we've asked for this year, depending upon what the future holds in terms of continual growth and economic development, we anticipate that there could be additional needs in that group. And our transportation group, the University of Michigan and our republic's are both embarking on very aggressive capital investment campaigns, which has a burden on our staff to make sure that we're staying on top of their schedule and reviewing things appropriately. And that requires resources. And we think that it's possible we'll need a conversation in a future year about augmenting our staff to support some of the growth things that we're seeing in the community and then on public works, that was the person that I talked about.

As we sort of change our transportation infrastructure to be pedestrian friendly, adding bicycle infrastructure, it changes a little bit how we do our work. And we may need some additional folks in the future to help support some of the maintenance activities with the sort of reconfigured infrastructure that we have in the city. Sustainable energy utility we anticipate if, as, as council considers a ballot initiative for this over the coming months, depending upon the results of that, if there is support in the community for forming a sustainable energy utility, a future FTE will be needed to lead that. Currently, Missy Stoltz has in her climate millage and set aside a budget for this position. So it's sort of held in reserve currently. Once we got out of the gate and actually the utility became sustainable, then the rates from the utility would support that position, but we would need some resources, likely from the climate millage, to support that FTE. Initially out of the gate. I think this may be my last slide, but on the treeline trail, this is something that was adopted by council in 2017, and there's a collaborative agreement between the city and the Treeline Conservancy we haven't dedicated a lot of resources to this, but if this is something that is an important priority for council, at some point in the future there will need to be resources allocated in order to realize the vision. And this is actually my last slide, I promise this time. So I'm not going to spend. But this is the money, right? Started with the money, ending with the money, Marty. So we're working on a lot of things and this is really. We've been really successful. I'll call out our transportation group, who's done an excellent job of getting other resources historically to support their work. Safe streets for all. As an example, we're going to continue to pursue grant opportunities to help get all of the things done. And what I've listed here is some areas where we will be focusing in the future. But really the number one thing is the water treatment plant rehab. We're talking about one of the largest projects in the history of the city and definitely the history of the city's water system. Over $100 million. So we'll need to be looking at what type of grant opportunities we can to support that. That's going to be a major priority. It's been a priority for Mister Fournier in talking about earmarks when we're sort of greasing the skids for things in the future. But there's also a lot of opportunities in DC through lots of different programs that are available for utility projects of this size. So we'll be pursuing that. And with that I will turn it over to Mister Delacourt. I always love going after Brian. It's a reminder how grateful I am. I don't have anywhere near as many funds as he has to deal with. Yeah. Second year of a two year budget, we did not per direction and like most years, did not make a lot of changes, are not asking for, are not proposing a lot of impacts for the general fund. We are talking about horizon issues across the board. For us in the planning and development area, the number one thing we're going to have to deal with in the coming years is going to be the adoption of the comprehensive plan and the costs that are going to be associated with that. We're not proposing anything this year. We are asking for. We are losing two long term staff planners that have about 57 years of experience between the two of them. We have talked about and are proposing to replace those with three entry level planners out of the general fund. Our costs are covered from what we save in retirement funds. So that is going to be our big change in the planning and development coming up is the replacement of two with hopefully three. Going forward, we're going to have to work hard in balancing those concerns or those. The big issue that's going to come is the balance between council priorities and the planning commission work plan. Making sure everybody's in line, there's going to be a lot of work that comes out of that plan. And making sure we understand how to implement that is probably going to be what's most important. The planning process, as difficult as it is, is going to be easy in comparison to the adoption of the ordinances that are necessary, necessary to implement it. And we think once that plan is done at the end of the year coming up, as we've seen recently with TC one and some of the other ordinances, really working with the community to develop and adopt those ordinances are going to take a lot of time and effort. And we just want everybody to realize that as we go forward with that, it's going to take a lot of patience as we bring that forward to implement whatever those results are. We're not proposing any big changes in the budget. Like I said, we've worked with Milton, try to make sure the staffing is there and that the savings we get from retirements will replace the planning department staff that's there. But the majority of their time now is spent moving projects through the system.

The time and effort it's going to take to engage with the community, to work with them on the adoption and the implementation of the plan goals, turning those into ordinances and codifying them in a way that is actually implementable. With all the other things we've heard that go into that utilities and everything else is going to probably be a longer process than everybody realizes and it's going to take capacity. So we're not going to be able to implement. Everybody's going to, we're going to get done with the plan and everybody's going to be very excited. And the plan is going to have a lot of things it wants to do in it. And making sure that we take those in an order and in a way that we have the capacity to implement well is going to be what's important when that's going finish. So again, not a lot of budget issues here, but just a conversation over the coming years about the capacity of the planning department, the loss of those planners. We have about five planners right now. We know the majority of their time, even with the replacements, are going to be spent on moving projects through the system. We've heard those are important to revenue. So we will have a lot of conversations about that. But we appreciate, hopefully the ability to replace those two long term planners with the three entry level positions and grow that department building and rental. This is relatively easy for us. It comes out of the construction fund. This is one of the funds other than the general fund we have that pays for things. We took a little pause through Covid and didn't. We kind of waited to see what that impact that was going to have on the projects and the development that came through the system. We saw very little slowdown through Covid and it's seen an increase since. What we're talking about is using the construction fund. It has a healthy balance. It continues to grow. We have proposed in this year's budget to add three trade inspectors, which you think would be simple enough to do. We have a hard time finding qualified trade inspectors now. We spend quite a bit of money supplementing that with contractors to try to keep up with demand. The importance of inspectors is really significant in that one, it keeps projects moving. When we can't get out to a site, when we can't get the inspections done, the project slows down. That causes backlog for everybody, doesn't help our reputation in the community. And two, it's an encouragement or it's an inducement for them to skip the inspections altogether and move on with the project, which we all know what kind of problem that can cause. We have the demand for these inspectors. We're talking about three, trade inspectors in the mechanical plumbing area to increase that. The other thing we're doing is we had hoped that the implementation of stream would simplify the process to the point where we wouldn't need to handhold folks as much as we did. We do. It's different and the folks we have to handhold are a little different. But what we are also proposing is hiring a permit liaison. That would be someone who is a single point of contact for anybody moving a building permit through the system. Right now, a building permit sounds like a relatively simple thing, but it can touch on five, six different areas in the city. And for those who are less skilled or those who utilize or use our software less, it can become a difficult process. So what we're hoping to do is bring one person in who is there to constantly pick up the phone, meet with people at the counter, help them find where their permit is in the process. Especially when we're dealing with the smaller residential building community. We have a lot of residents who pull their own permits to do work that can be a daunting situation in any community. So we're hopeful that that person can be someone to help them get through the system easily answer all those questions. So that's there as well. All of those positions are designed to help improve customer service. It does touch on the work that John and the city administrator's office is doing on improving process and economic development. We think the number one way we can do that is help people get through the process. And then the other thing we're considering is, I haven't even told Milton this yet, but I stuck it on the slide because I was hoping you would tell them it was a great idea. Is maybe spending a little bit of the construction fund on an audit of the department. There are places that we can go and we're probably at the point with stream implementation, maybe considering bringing in an outside resource to audit how our process works. Everything we do, not something that's designed to find fault, but to find ways we can find efficiencies and improve the process throughout the department. So we are thinking about doing that. It would come out of the construction fund, not the general fund, but we think with these positions in place that we can do that.

It is really hard for us to find positions in the building department in the trade inspections. We've put in $100,000.01 time cost this year to help HR do direct recruiting of inspection staff. So with three or four positions hiring, we think that's a good expense and think it'll be worthwhile to get them all in here at the same time. Rental service our whole goal is always, we have. We're able to do about 6000 rental inspections a year. I think we have 30,000 rental units. We try to get them in every two to three years. The math just doesn't add up. We have six rental inspectors. We're not asking for it this year. They're paid for out of the general fund. But our goal is to show Covid set us back, but to show that each individual rental inspector is able to cover their own costs. And then hopefully next year, if we're able to demonstrate that we'll be back asking for some more. We'd really like to get into the rental properties more often. So, and also we've seen with the renters commission and some other things and we'd like to be able to get to those concerns on a more regular basis as well. This is what keeps me up at night, as I've told Milton and everybody hears me running around screaming and banging on tables at city hall about. I appreciate Brian's comments. The public service department and Brian have been excellent in these conversations. We have a capital shortfall in parks that is coming to fruition over the next 20 or 30 years. That is significant. I will add on the Dixboro bridge, the county was nice enough. We actually offered to take the bridge if they would just bring it up to standard and I think they told us no, which I was a little disappointed with. I didn't want to take it in the first place. But we have these things in the dam rehabilitations. The Dixboro Bridge, the Ada is a known cost. That's $20 million in today's dollars. As we implement that, those improvements over the next 20 years, that's going to get more expensive. We've started a capital study this year with a company to study all of park's capital assets. We anticipate conservatively $75 million in costs to come out of that. Hopefully it's not much more, but it's going to be a significant cost. We know right now we have playgrounds at the end of life, veterans, rank needs help. These are examples of all the costs that are going to come due over the next ten or 20 years that the current funding sources, there isn't enough money to cover them all. And we are going to work with Milton over the next year to bring, not this year, but hopefully next year, a funding plan for at least the next five or ten years, how to start to tackle these items in a reasonable manner. Otherwise they're just going to continue to deteriorate, fall apart and become. Become more costly. The way we want to look at that is obviously there is no one magic bullet that's going to fix this for parks. We've started the capital study. One of the initial things we want to talk about is the parks millage comes due in 26 for renewal. We are not currently looking at increasing that. We are working with finance about the potential to extend the years of it. I think it's six years right now. If we extend the years of it, we may be able to bond against it in a manner that would allow us to raise some capital to do some things without raising the cost of the millage. Obviously, our fee evaluation is going to have to be part of that. Sponsorship grants, public partnerships. I think council talked about it the other night, not only the golf courses, but I think an evaluation of park owned property to see if there's anything that could be monetized or generate revenue potentially to meet other council priorities. Whether it's sustainability, whether it's affordable housing that would help recoup revenue for the park system. We don't want to get there, but are there services that are outdated or are no longer necessary for the community? And then lastly, once all of those things have been evaluated, do we have to look at an additional millage or bond in the short term to pay for some of these capital assets before they get to the point where they're not recuperable, where they're not able to be repaired and actually more costly? That is park's priority over the next year. That's what we are thinking about over the next year. We hope to have a more thought through plan on how to accomplish this next year. But we wanted to put it out there this year as something to think forward about and give you guys all something to think about this year. That is all I have today. Like I said most we did ask for one FTE in parks that was paid for through moving some funding sources around between existing funds. There's no additional cost to the general fund. Milton was kind enough to approve that already and we're already in the hiring process for that. Other than that, we've really had no significant impact on the general fund this year.

We think that conversation for us comes next year through the parks conversation. So with that, I didn't bring my staff because they like me better when I don't ask them to come here and that's important to me. But we will certainly answer any questions you have at the end. Good evening. I'm here to talk about diversity, equity and inclusion through the office of organizational Equity. I'm going to start off with what we are not. We are not located in or under HR. We're a standalone office and we do get a lot of confusion about. Wait, you're not a part of HR? No, we're located. Our offices are there, but we are standalone. And I'll talk about why we're standalone as we go forward. So the first thing we'd like to do is increase our visibility, engagement and knowledge of the OOE and implementation of our expertise. We need to create some branding. We've got some great parks and rec branding and lots of other areas that are branded. And so that's something that we're looking to do next year. And we are dedicated to participating in community events that will give us strengthened stakeholder engagement and a connectivity to the community that we're still working to develop. I've been here almost 18 months now professional development. Our accessibility coordinator needs to go to conferences once a year to maintain the certification that they are currently finishing up. We have a couple of other small things that individually we have. I'm a certified diversity executive, things like that. Just continuing to stay in the front of our dei journey, and I think I know my plan is to position Ann Arbor as the leader in Deiaj plus in public service next, where I was kind of referring to, wait, we're located, but we're not. Everything begins with equity. Every one of our offices and departments and areas here in the city, as employees, we belong in and we are in. We talk to individuals from every department almost every day, helping guide the way that equity is brought into things. We want to empower my colleagues to seamlessly integrate DEIaj plus into reports, reviews, project programs. We're creating easy checklists and training. And we're also looking to kind of partner this in with future initiatives such as performance appraisals that are coming through to the city that will of course, bring better informed decision making through data utilization, and it will improve our accountability and transparency. Right now we're running around with, wait, who was over that? Or who would be in charge of this if we were going to do it in some areas. And so having everyone understand which way we're walking down a path would help in doing the accountability and transparency. Also looking to create an OOE ambassador, if you don't notice, I love acronyms. Infusing the EIAJ plus in every area of the city. So what that would do is we would have one city staff in each area who we train, basically bring up in a small credentialing kind of way. We've got our new learning management system. Thank you for approving that. That can help deliver some of that training as well as in person, so that the conversation of equity is brought out more. It's an inclusive culture. When there's meetings, the three staff that we are don't have to go to different departments and divide up and go to these meetings. They'll have baby experts in their area, and that will demonstrate a commitment to the Deiaj principles of Ann Arbor. Next is refreshing and refining all areas around accessibility, equitable and inclusive framework. So as we are kind of solidifying in the OOE office, we're realizing some areas that haven't been addressed yet. One of the things is my PowerPoint. My portion of the PowerPoint is not very accessible. If you're an individual who has a neurodiversity around reading right, if you have dyslexia there's a whole lot of words and a whole lot of acronyms with not pictures. And this is the exact opposite of what I advise people to do. Take words out, put pictures in is what you're supposed to be doing. So we want to create those languages, those rules. When you write a memo, it should always be this way so everyone can read it. Right. That's the basis of inclusion, is looking at all of those things. We also want to elevate the way that data is collected and asked best practices. We want to revolutionize the way that we do assessments here at the city, audits, accreditations and beyond for anyone that's interested and for some of those that aren't, it will again enhance our decision making through data. So I talked about the equity belongs everywhere. It really, really is. And I've been working on this and needs to be embedded in HR. HR is our blood of the organization. It goes everywhere. Without HR, we really struggle with ever moving forward. So we've been training DEI opportunities for HR employees, really pulling it in and saying, this is how this would look like. And we've begun measuring and assessing if there's changes that's going ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Ann Arbor Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Increased emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion through the office of Organizational Equity.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Dedication to participating in community events to strengthen stakeholder engagement and community connectivity.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Professional development and certifications for DEI staff to ensure continued leadership in DEI.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Creation of easy checklists and training for DEI integration in reports, reviews, and projects.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Implementation of a learning management system for training delivery.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Empowerment and improved accountability and transparency through better-informed decision making using data.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Creating an OOE ambassador in each city department to promote an inclusive culture.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Refining frameworks around accessibility and inclusiveness, e.g., making presentations more accessible to neurodiversity.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Elevating data collection and assessment practices to enhance decision making.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Training DEI opportunities for HR employees and measuring changes.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Ann Arbor Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Increased emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion through the office of Organizational Equity.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Dedication to participating in community events to strengthen stakeholder engagement and community connectivity.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Professional development and certifications for DEI staff to ensure continued leadership in DEI.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Creation of easy checklists and training for DEI integration in reports, reviews, and projects.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Implementation of a learning management system for training delivery.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Empowerment and improved accountability and transparency through better-informed decision making using data.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Creating an OOE ambassador in each city department to promote an inclusive culture.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Refining frameworks around accessibility and inclusiveness, e.g., making presentations more accessible to neurodiversity.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Elevating data collection and assessment practices to enhance decision making.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Training DEI opportunities for HR employees and measuring changes.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 3629964, "chunk_end_time": 4092830, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBTeY0Sw28g", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBTeY0Sw28g&t=3629s"}, {"start": 59000, "end": 65000, "text": "ures in is what you're supposed to be doing.

So I talked about the equity belongs everywhere. It really, really is. And I've been working on this and needs to be embedded in HR. HR is our blood of the organization. It goes everywhere. Without HR, we really struggle with ever moving forward. So we've been training DEI opportunities for HR employees, really pulling it in and saying, this is how this would look like. And we've begun measuring and assessing if there's changes that's going to expand the knowledge of our HR individuals and our new incoming HR director one day to look at everything through the DEI lens, look at it equitably and inclusively. And then the next area of focus is the modernization, I would call it, of recruitment. Right now, we're recruiting in a lot of 1980s, nineties ways. No shade on our recruiting staff or HR at all. They do a great job with what they have. But I come in with this expertise in this area and I'm excited to get it going. That would start with the way that we write our job descriptions all the way through retention and reengagement. So in public service, one of your biggest issues with your employees is they've been here for many years doing the same job. Just like on a line for any of the auto companies. You get disengaged, but you're still doing your job. And so reengagement is part of that. The recruitment and reengagement and retention are all areas that I look to as part of our recruitment, and it will drive institutional and systemic changes. When we can bring in individuals, younger individuals, who look at the world in a completely different way than a lot of us do, we're going to see institutional and systemic changes really happen quickly. The conversation, they walk in the door, things happen, things change. They ask, why are we walking down this path? This way? And it makes everyone stop and look at it and say, oh, what's a new innovative way we can do this? That's our hope with HR. And then horizon issues for us is an internal, so for all employees, an external equity assessment here in the city, because there has not been a DEI office, we have not ever run a full equity. What do you think about the diversity here in the city? Give us your feedback assessment. We've got no specific data that we're working on. And so as strategic plans for other departments, this would be that as well. It would also really help us focus as a city and you as the council on allocating resources in the areas that people say it's needed. You know, we do a great job with all the data that we have and we go out and look and see, but where are the gaps? Right. We need to find the gaps and close the gaps in the most equitable way possible. And that will increase satisfaction as it relates to the city government. It will increase transparency. It does some really amazing things. When you ask the questions, show the results, show the progress or the failures, because you do fail in some areas of this and just the continued move forward, you want to promote space to have those constructive discourses. And that's all that I have for you. Thank you very much. And it's Chief Kennedy's turn. Thanks, Larry. All right, good evening, mayor and council. So a couple of horizon issues with the fire service. Emergency management falls under fire. So for city our size, we really are at a deficit not having a turnkey emergency operations center, especially the last year, there were multiple instances where that would have been beneficial for city staff to get together. And so we just, we keep coming up with either natural or other incidents where that would be advantageous for us. So that it would be, the primary purpose would be to function as emergency operations center. The idea would be it would also be set up so if departments needed to use it for training, it could be set up that way with the idea that, hey, you could get evicted quickly if a situation arises that we need it for something else. Of the three items that's on the list tonight, the second one, the ambulance transport, is really the one that's probably the most pressing. We're seeing nothing but an increase far beyond our initial projection for how much we are transporting with the fire department. They transported twice yesterday. We were originally thinking this was going to be kind of a once in a, it was going to be a safety net. Now it's becoming a regular occurrence, and it just speaks to the need for that one of the bigger issues for this fall is this football season is going to be unlike what we have experienced before. It's not noon games against a sleepy community college in September between Texas and USC. The Big ten games that we saw at the end of the year. Welcome to September. These are going to be big, prime time national media coverage for many of these games. I have the strong desire to want to be able to put on additional rigs. We don't have that capacity right now. We just have the one ambulance. We do have a kind of an emergency agreement with Dearborn. They struggle with keeping their fleet online. So that's a. Our needed use for a second ambulance is going to become much more than what that agreement with Dearborn was ever intended to do. The proposal to Mister Dahoni were kind of two ways, one of which could be to get a used ambulance. They're used for a reason that comes with a host of challenges in terms of ongoing maintenance costs. The cost of a new one is also pretty expensive.

It's not noon games against a sleepy community college in September between Texas and USC. The Big ten games that we saw at the end of the year. Welcome to September. These are going to be big, prime time national media coverage for many of these games. I have the strong desire to want to be able to put on additional rigs. We don't have that capacity right now. We just have the one ambulance. We do have a kind of an emergency agreement with Dearborn. They struggle with keeping their fleet online. So that's a. Our needed use for a second ambulance is going to become much more than what that agreement with Dearborn was ever intended to do. The proposal to Mister Dahoni were kind of two ways, one of which could be to get a used ambulance. They're used for a reason that comes with a host of challenges in terms of ongoing maintenance costs. The cost of a new one is also pretty expensive. So I await his and miss Prashan's what direction they're going to want to propose for that. But that second ambulance is really something that's very necessary in an operational need for our department. And then the other one that we're really looking for. This will not be a budget request out of general fund, but is to fund the new fire station four on the east side. This is the station that's currently at Platt and here on Parkway. It would be to replace it at its current location. I know Mister Fournier is going to touch on this. This is part of current federal earmarks. This is also on the list for state of Michigan earmarks. This is literally shovel ready. It's gone through site plan approval. We are ready to bid this project. The big one that we recently found out is we receive funding from the state of Michigan, not the University of Michigan, but the state of Michigan annually for covering public facilities. Obviously the University of Michigan is the square footage behemoth of that. And so that funding historically was not very dependent. The state has funded that consistently for going on, I believe, five years now in discussion with the bond attorney that I would refer to, the finance department with those funds are going to be eligible to bond. So that's what we would advocate is if we don't receive funding, either state or federal earmark funding for this station, or there's a balance that we would this summer or fall, explore the bond market for that, ideally with a bid the end of calendar 24 and there's really no reason we couldn't start construction next year. Construction costs are only going to go up. This station is truly infrastructure is failing. We had to install a sump pump to kick the sanitary sewer out. So we and just continued investment in this building is just good money after bad. So that is what I have and Mister Fournier, good evening. I will try my best to be brief. I want to talk about what our earmark requests are for this year. Federal earmark requirements requests are being put in right now with Congress. I will start with our state appropriations. We're asking for three projects right now. First is finishing funding for the election center, which we still have a lot of interest in leadership in the legislature on this project. So I'm optimistic. As chief Kennedy has said, we are also asking for funding for the fire station. $12 million total. Ask not convinced that there's $12 million of money in the legislature for this project, but we're asking for support in any amount that they can give us. And lastly, we're asking for funds for the emergency operations center. Since our ARPA funds have been expended at the state level, there is less money to go around. So earmark opportunities certainly exist in Lansing, but they're not as bountiful as they were in the last fiscal year. So we're trying to keep that in mind and be a little more strategic about what we're asking for on the federal side. I don't know how to say this politely, but Congress is a basket case. They haven't passed their budget from last year. However, our representatives, Representative Dingell and Senator Peters and senator Stabenow have asked for submissions for earmarks for the coming budget for fiscal year 25. The guidance hasn't changed this year, mostly because the guidance hasn't actually been set. So they have simply asked us to use last year's guidance to ask for projects. So we are renewing our requests from last year. They all scored very well, but because of the political machinations in DC, were washed out at various parts of the appropriations process. We'll be asking for $1.5 million for a train station design and engineering to get the train station project moving again. $2 million to help with the Barton Pond embankment project. That's a $6.8 million project total. So we're looking for funds to help offset some of those costs. And we're also supporting a request for the treeline trail to help them kick off another round of property acquisition for their efforts at $2 million. It should be noted that there was one other ask that we asked for last year, which is funding to help support our vision. Zero efforts in the downtown to update pedestrian signals. Congresswoman Dingell, it appears, has been successful at getting that earmark request partially funded, which is a bit of a coup. There are a lot of Democrats who were shot out of earmark funding this year in Congress. And so when you see her, please thank her for her diligence moving forward. You've seen a lot of these projects already mentioned by staff, but we have quite a bit of capital obligations coming up in the next 1020 years. Replacement of the water treatment plant is important.

The Barton Dam rehabilitation, all of the expenses related to our sustainability plan and the carbon neutral land arbor plan, and of course, the train station. Many of these projects, four of them, by my eye, are more than $100 million projects. And so, you know, when we ask for community project funding from the state or the federal government, that's usually funding that comes at most in a couple million dollar chunks at most. And so we do our best to fund the priorities that we have. We look for projects that are shovel ready and can be right sized to that ask amount. But we also aren't shy about ask, asking for support for the larger projects. But these larger projects are not going to be completed by some kind of saving grace of money from the federal government. And I think that's important for us to keep in mind. We need to be accumulating sources of funding from a broad spectrum in order to get these projects done. So with that, I'm proud to say I might be the shortest speaker tonight for once in my career with the city of Ann Arbor. And I will turn the microphone over to Maura Thompson. Good evening, Mayor Taylor, council members, nice to be with you tonight. So we're gonna jump right in. I always like to start with reminding everybody that the downtown development Authority runs two systems. We run the parking system for the city of Ann Arbor, and we run the tax increment financing system, better known as TIF. And through TIF is how we make our investments in downtown. And it's important to note that the TIF system does not support the parking system and the parking system does not support the TIF system. So tonight, I'm going to start with the parking system. So for FY 25, some of our major areas of focus in the parking system include, as I think you are all well aware, we have a proposed slate of rate increases. The DDA board will be voting on these rates at their April board meeting. Should they approve the rate increase, the rates will be implemented in June. Getting this rate increase approved is really critical for the DDA to meet the two main priorities that we have in our parking system, which is to maintain these very important city assets and to run a financially sound system. On the sustainability and energy efficiency side, we are working on in FY 25, replacing 888 metal halide light fixtures in two of our structures. So the forest street structure and the fourth and Washington street structure will have complete light fixture replacement. They will be replaced with leds that will save on our energy consumption and on our costs. We will also be replacing all of the rooftop fencing on all of our facilities. If you recall, it's been about seven years. We started a project where we began installing fencing on all of our facilities. We began at the rooftop and we've worked our way down. Our goal was to get every level covered above level two. We finished that this fall, and now, just as we intended to do, we're revisiting the rooftops so the new fencing will have an enhanced design and enhanced materials. And then as we do every year, we will be taking on about $1.6 million in annual restoration. Things like, I don't need to read these, all concrete masonry repairs, weatherproofing, a whole host of things. And all of this is in service to extend the life of these city assets. So on the horizon for the parking system before I get into some of the highlights for the future, I have to say that all of this is predicated on parking rates being approved. Should those rate increases not be approved, our focus will look much different and we will have some very challenging decisions to make. So, assuming being optimistic and assuming that parking rates get, that those rates get approved. Financial stewardship is something that we're always looking at in the parking system. So through our rates study, we utilized specialized software from a company called Muniworth. They developed a modeling system where we are now able to look at the impacts that changes in utilization and changes in rates have on the financial picture of our parking system moving into the future. So we now have this really powerful budgeting tool that we can use to keep on top of changes that are occurring in the system. And what's the impact on the capital improvement side? We will continue to follow very diligently a 20 year maintenance plan. We just updated this plan to include all of those capital improvements that would defer during the pandemic. So this is a particularly important year for that capital improvements plan because we're starting to program into outlying years all of those capital needs, including everything that was deferred. And again, the goal of this is to maximize the life of these city assets. We'll also continue on the light fixture replacement. As I mentioned, we will hit two structures in FY 25 in outlying years. We will just continue that work throughout the system. And finally, the DDA is committed to continuing to to fund the GOPAss and the get downtown program to encourage transit use.

And this is not only to help move the needle on our very ambitious VMT goals of reducing our VMT by 50%, but the GOPAss is also a really valuable tool for our downtown employers to offer for their employees. So now we're going to move on to the TIF side. And just as a reminder, TIF is the only revenue sharing tool we have in Michigan to make investments, infrastructure investments in our downtown. So the DDA really works hard to leverage these tax dollars to maximize the community benefit. So for FY 25 on the TIF side, we are in a very intentional planning phase and all of the initiatives in 25 are connected and coordinated with city efforts. So we are in the process of developing a new development and TIF plan. This will be a DDA plan that is in alignment with current city goals and a plan that is in alignment with state statutes. State statute has changed since the last time our plan was updated in in 2003 and we are doing this work really in parallel with the city's comprehensive plan, and we anticipate having this plan completed probably in June of 2025. So it's a lengthy process. The downtown Area Circulation study this is a collaboration with the city. The study itself has four main pillars that we're looking at. However, the overall goal of the study is really to balance the demands that we're seeing placed on our downtown streets. The recommendations that come from this study will inform future capital investments for the DDA, which in turn will inform our development plan. Energy Utility study this is a collaboration with our colleagues in the Office of Sustainability, and I believe you all just approved at your last council meeting, the energy utility study contract. Shortly you will be seeing a cost share from the DDA coming your way. We are participating in funding a portion of this study because amongst the many things the study is going to look at, it will be looking at identifying locations for geothermal in our downtown. So again, the recommendations from this energy utility study will inform our future work, which will inform our development plan. We'll also continue in FY 25 on working with our, again, our colleagues at the city on defining maintenance responsibilities in our downtown. So we've been working on determining who takes care of what elements in our downtown. And the goal really is to identify gaps in maintenance and also look at things that perhaps the city is currently maintaining where maybe it might make more sense for the DDA to take over some of those things. And again, this is all in service of preparing for our new development plan. And finally, in 25, we have a major focus on data collection. So we recently subscribed to two data services, Placer AI and Replica. We are also installing additional counters along our bikeway streets. And what we're looking to do with this data is to really understand pandemic recovery trends downtown and the outcomes of our projects. And we've just kind of dipped our toe into the water on looking into this data. There's just so much. And I'm actually going to bring, I'll be here Monday night doing a DDA update, and I'm going to bring you all a sample of what we're seeing. I think you'll find it really interesting. And so on the TIF side, on the horizon, the pandemic taught us many lessons. One of the lessons that we learned was the importance of having a resilient downtown. And by resilient I mean resilient to crisis, whether it be health related, whether it be climate related, whether it be economic. So we are focusing our efforts into the future on doing what we can to ensure that we have a resilient downtown. And by focusing on the areas I'm going to talk about. So place making and vibrancy. I think we all know that really what we need to make a downtown vibrant is people. And in order to attract people, we must invest in quality of life infrastructure. I recently read an article about the path to prosperity in Michigan, and one of the things they talked about was we need to really shift the way we're looking at economic development from kind of the traditional we need to attract businesses to we need to get a concentration of talent. So basically what we want to do is what will bring young, talented people here? What are they looking for in a community? And I think what they're looking for, and I think the data shows what they're looking for is walkability. They're looking for places that are safe to bike. They're looking for transit rich communities. They're looking for communities that have a certain experience. So investing in place making is very important. 820. We know that we have very ambitious climate neutrality goals. And we also know that our infrastructure projects can help move the needle on some of these goals. Again, the recommendations from the studies we talked about on the previous slide are really going to inform the work we do.

We know that all of these things contribute to safer and more comfortable streets, and we are committed to continuing our work to try to advance vision zero. On the affordability side, we'll be continuing to work with our partners at the housing commission. We are always looking for ways or opportunities where we can coordinate our infrastructure work so that we are supporting the work that the Housing commission is doing. 121 Katherine and 350 south fifth are great examples of this, and we will continue to work with them on those efforts. And then, of course, we're committed to our housing grants. And typically those housing grants, although they've been used for many things, typically they're safeguarding existing units in our downtown, which is really critical. And finally on the horizon for the DDA, when we're thinking about challenges, our biggest challenge will be revenue constraints. In 2017, the DDA's Tif capture was capped. Our growth is limited to 3.5% a year. And just to give you a little perspective of that, in FY 25, the TIF capture above the cap will be 27% of that total capture. By 2032, it will be 49% of the capture, and it continues to escalate. So we know that we will not have a shortage of projects, but we will be challenged to really prioritize which projects we move forward with. And that is all I have. And I think miss hall is up next. Good evening, mayor and city council. I'm just going to highlight some of the big picture issues that we're working on. Number one, affordable housing development. The housing commission's budget is about $50 million a year, but only a small percent of that is part of the general fund. We receive $160,000 annually from general fund, and we receive about $8 million from the county mental health millage, plus the affordable housing millage. So most of our funding is actually not part of the city's budget. But just a reminder, all of our ftes are in the city's budget, paid for with general fund and then reimbursed with our funding sources. So on the affordable housing development side, we will be breaking ground at Katherine. In April, you will be invited to our groundbreaking ceremony. Once we pick a date, you will all be invited. We are hoping to own the property at the end of March or the first week of April, and then we are right away going to start with our groundbreaking, 350 South Fifth. We actually had interviews with our two top candidates today for co developers, so we will have someone selected in the next couple weeks. So we will be moving forward on that project on March 18. 123 west summer is on the agenda for sale. It's a small portion of 721 North Maine and at Ashley Street. Ihn family Shelter has moved their offices in. They've been there for a couple weeks. Hopefully. You've also been invited to their open house where they've been able to move their administrative offices out of their shelter and have expanded their family capacity at their shelter on Jackson Road. The other issues that we're working on is how to finance all of these projects. And of course, the affordable housing millage is a huge help with gap financing. And also on March 18, there's an agenda item for your consideration to do bond financing with our Catherine project, which will enable us to build more housing sooner in the next few years and leverage the millage to pay back the bond over the life of the millage over the next 18 years. The other big issue that we are working on is the services provided to our residents. A large majority of the funding that is used to pay our nonprofits to do on site services, as well as with our voucher tenants, is through the county's mental health millage that passes through our department and then onto our nonprofits. After we're done, I'm going to just hand out a sheet, or I can email it to you as well. All the different nonprofits then why and where they're funded at. So you have an idea? Some of our horizon issues, a big one is the county mental health millage. Last Wednesday, the county started discussions, the county board started discussions about re issuing that on the November 2024 ballot or re upping it and requesting it to be funded. But there's a lot of discussion, discussion on potential changes as to what actually will be covered by that millage. That is, 100% of the funding that's in our affordable housing bucket of the 40 40 20 split is passed through to our nonprofits for services. So if we do not renew, that millage will have a very big impact on the properties that we have and the tenants that we work with. The second one is the marijuana rebate funds. It's not really part of the general funds, but it does impact the work that we do in our partners in the community.

It's not really part of the general funds, but it does impact the work that we do in our partners in the community. Last week there was a summary of the different projects that were council initiatives and how you wanted to spend the council, the marijuana rebate funds. And so I just provided a six month update on what those funds were spent on and how they were utilized. Largest program was a new initiative called that the community that is working on it called Rising Hope, and that is for trauma informed case management services for families that have vouchers that are in the justice system somehow criminal justice system. There is funding for a variety of youth programs, probably many of which you have heard of, as well as eviction prevention funding, and then some funding for our Catherine street project, for the non residential part of our project. The other horizon issue is really doing this extra development, and we've secured a lot of new grants outside of the city has caused a strain on my staff, both in having enough staff to do the work, as well as having space for people to actually do the work, both on our offices and our maintenance facility. We do have quite a few FTD that are in the budget, all of which would be paid for with funding that we secure outside of the general fund. And so we don't fill those positions until there's the immediate need for them, and then we have the funding for them. So when a property comes online and we have revenue coming in to pay for property management, maintenance and financial services is the primary items, we are continuing to look for a permanent place for us to expand our services and consolidate our offices. We have. Most of our offices are between Miller Manor as well as south industrial, and we don't have room between those spaces for all of our staff. And so those are our main items that we're thinking about in the future. Thank you. So you had a lot of information thrown at you. I can tell by the looks on your faces, it's been a lot. Everybody's here for questions. I know by the rules. We have a hard stop in seven minutes. I don't know how you want to handle it. I don't know if anybody here for public comment, but we're ready to answer questions. If you ask your question, the appropriate person will step up here and answer it, and then I'll come back and close it out whenever we're done. Are there questions? Councilmember Dish, if I may interrupt briefly, perhaps to relieve the suspense. I guess what I'd suggest we do is we run through questions, and if indeed someone shows up for public comment, we'll either hear them or push them off to the end. But you all are here, so there is public comment. Great. Well, we'll have one or two public comments at 845, and then roll back with questions, since you all are here and we all are here. Council member, dish. My apologies. No need. Thank you, staff. That was pretty amazing. I have actually two questions for Miss Thompson. You mentioned that 17% of the trunk lines are within the DDA, and I wanted to ask, how do you imagine partnering with us to develop the financial capacity to take these over? Or what were you thinking about in flagging that for us? And then. I'm sorry, but I just need you to go through what the last thing you said a little more slowly. So, by 2032, the Tif capture above the DDA's cap will be 40% of the TiF capture. I'm just confused how that can be. Yeah, sure. So, by 2032. And now I'm going to give you rough numbers, because I don't know them off the top of my head, but the total TIF capture will be, I'm going to say, between 20 and 22 million. And the split will be the DDA would receive 51% of that, which will be about, I don't know, ten or 11 million. And the amount above the cap would be 49% of that. So I'm kind of making up these. The dollar figures, but the amount above the DDA's capture will be 49% of the total capture. And in terms of the MDOT jurisdictional transfer study, depending on the direction that council goes, because those. There are parts of those trunk lines that are within our district, by statute, we could either participate in funding, participate in projects, so we could be a partner on those. It just depends on what council decides and what direction that goes in. But we certainly are eligible to be a potential partner. Further questions. Councillor Harrison. Thank you. And thank you all for your presentations this evening. This question is for Miss hall. Couple questions. Thank you. I know you did provide a summary for us on the programs that were utilized by the. With the marijuana excess tax revenue, so thank you for that. I wanted to ask you if you could elaborate a little bit more on the impact of each of these programs, if you could. I think they're each quite different from each other in that the Rising Hope program. What we did was we gathered the various nonprofits, the sheriff, and others who work in this area, and said, how would you create a program where you would collaborate with each other? So there's different agencies that do stuff on their own, like catholic social services, so's.

I think they're each quite different from each other in that the Rising Hope program.

So there's different agencies that do stuff on their own, like catholic social services, so's. And we brought them together, and they created the program together also with the Washington Housing alliance. And so they created a system to coordinate and determine who was best at certain parts of running the program. And so I think of all the programs, it is one that has a structure to it. Whereas, for example, the youth programs were all existing nonprofits that had existing programs that we were able to supplement and add to and enable them to expand what they were doing, some of which had overlapping collaboration, and some of which are sort of standalone. And the way those ended up being funded was, again, I reached out to the entities that we work with the most that we know serve the most low income youth in the community, which is knpeace and Avalon. And then in talking to them, they recommended other organizations that are also youth programming. And they all sort of supported each other in how those were funded. The eviction prevention was intended originally to be a collaboration with the county in putting funds into an eviction prevention program. That county funds, I'm not even sure yet if those have. I think they're just now becoming available. So those got spent by the city, our portion of the funds, without having the county as part of that partnership. Ours went so fast, and that's exactly what it sounds like, is eviction prevention. Where there is somebody who is going to lose their housing, they're about to be evicted through the court process. And what they need is actual funds to pay back old rent or court fees or that kind of thing. And then the third one or the fourth one. Sorry, Kathryn Street 150 was for all the work. Like the architect engineer, the designing, the community engagement related to the non residential part of our development, because we can't spend our residential funds on our non residential portion. And then a one time $325,000 was for the physical build out and construction of the space. And in my report last month, I requested renewal of these projects. But obviously that is up to you on what you prioritize and how you want to look at that. Any of them can be scaled up or down depending on what funding is available. Okay, thank you. I think I do have a follow up question for the rising Hope program. You referenced that there is an average of 15 families per month that's receiving services. Is that speak a little bit about the growth, I guess, of do you see that more families, or do you see that growing, growing need or. Yeah, I think the growth happened about in the third or fourth month because it took a couple months just to bring people together and talk about, you know, how do we make referrals. How do we keep confidentiality? How do we track things? Things like that. What are we tracking? What are we doing? So it took a couple months before the program was up and running, and then it was about letting the community know that this service was available. It is not just for folks who have vouchers through the housing commission. There's other vouchers in the community that are administered through other entities, included those other voucher families as well. And so now it's really folks hearing about it getting into one of the groups that are doing the actual programming. And some are quick and easy. Nothing's easy, but more straightforward. And some are much longer term and more complicated. And I would expect people to have reasons to come back and use different types of services. It's a very broad, client specific services. So it could be anything from help with a security deposit, help with mental health issues, help with financial issues. It could be with youth in the program. It could be with adults in the program. So it's very wide. What can be coupled. Okay, great. So it's pretty broad. And do we have any data yet on. I mean, really the question, I guess I'm wondering is, is it helping to keep people housed? I mean, that was what the overall goal was, was to help keep individuals who are out in the community and not living in supportive, you know, within supportive, you know, services to kind of keep them housed. Yes. And I actually have new data that I will forward to city council that I totally forgot I was going to do that. I just got it last week. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you so much.

First, I want to apologize for interrupting the conversations, but thank you for giving me a moment to speak. My name is Heather Zelensky, and I'm here tonight on behalf of the Autism Society of Greater Detroit. I came tonight because I wanted to be able to introduce our organization to this city and to the council that serves it. About eight years ago, there was a handful of small affiliates in Michigan. They were related to the autism Society. The national organization. National had shut those doors, closed down. Those individual operations did a little bit of a restructuring and came back with a model that allowed for one affiliate for each state. The Autism Society of Greater Detroit is that one affiliate. We're completely volunteer led, and that means that we have to currently focus our services on the five closest counties. So Macomb, Wayne, Oakland, St. Clair, and Washtenaw counties. However, with the support of our community and members such as you guys, will be able to spread our services to accommodate the needs of the state of Michigan over the next five years. Our main purpose is to be able to connect between services, service organization, state services, and the individuals that are impacted by autism, as well as other neurodiversities. We offer resources 24/7 through our website as well as through our referral service. We hold events such as resource exposure training for professionals or organizations that want to interact with the autistic community. We have adult social club meetups, vaccination clinics for those that are overwhelmed with traditional medical settings, peer support groups, and more. As we help the community, we're able to find and connect with resources that are available to them. Sometimes we're also able to identify gaps services that just aren't available in the state of Michigan. In those instances, we would write a grant and then we would partner with community organizations that exist to create things that fill the gap for those individuals. If you don't, if you have an opportunity that we can partner with you guys or partner with the city to be able to come on board on some of those events, we would love that opportunity to be able to make our name and our mission a little bit more well known. Obviously, you can contact me directly. I'll leave some information at the end of the table, or visit our website, which is autismsocietygreaterdetroit.org dot. Overall, I just look forward to being. Being able to work with each of you and each of the cities in our state, to be able to help every individual live life more fully. That's all. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone else in house who would like to speak at public comment? Is there anyone online who would like to speak at public comment? Mayor, no one has their hand raised. Seeing no one. Public comment is closed. Councilmember Ackman, thank you. I have a question for Chief Kennedy. You had mentioned an increase in the ambulance transport needs, and I was just wondering why you think that is. I mean, if I could. If you. Maybe you could refresh my memory on why we got it in the first place and why maybe the need is increased with Huron Valley still at play. Sure. The reasons for the transfer, the reasons for the increase are the same reasons we got into it. There's a national paramedic shortage. It's even more pronounced for private ems. Fire departments are continuing. Fire departments are actually struggling with recruiting, which a decade ago would have been unheard of. We're still very fortunate in our city being somewhat of a destination department, but the issues that are confronting HVA are national issues, and it's really just staffing. So we're finding that just, we're getting called when they go to zero status that they don't have units available. We're also finding that as our staff are becoming more comfortable with this, because this is a new thing for them, we have some protocol ability where if it's a patient that doesn't, if a patient meets certain thresholds, excuse me, we can cancel HVA and transport ourselves. And what that helps system wide is that frees up an advanced unit for a more critical care patient. So this is really having a really, I mean, the intent is for the city, but it's truly having a countywide impact that we're taking care of the low acuity patients, so the higher acuity patients, the paramedic resources are available, so their staffing has continued. Our staffing or their staffing needs have continued to struggle, and our staff has become more familiar with it, which is really kind of all pointing to that increase. Follow up question now that we're going to be charging fees, as I don't think we have until recently. Correct. Will that help us? You know, how much, to what degree will that help us fund the actual service? So working with finance, the fees are meant to be cost neutral. Cost recovery. Thank you. Thank you. Cost recovery.

So this is really having a really, I mean, the intent is for the city, but it's truly having a countywide impact that we're taking care of the low acuity patients, so the higher acuity patients, the paramedic resources are available, so their staffing has continued. Our staffing or their staffing needs have continued to struggle, and our staff has become more familiar with it, which is really kind of all pointing to that increase. Follow up question now that we're going to be charging fees, as I don't think we have until recently. Correct. Will that help us? You know, how much, to what degree will that help us fund the actual service? So working with finance, the fees are meant to be cost neutral. Cost recovery. Thank you. Thank you. Cost recovery. Once we get about 90 days into that, literally at the last meeting, the funds were approved. We're still working with our third party provider. There's a tremendous amount that needs to get set up with Medicare, Medicaid billing. It's quite a mountain to get all that set up. So really to be determined. I wish I had a better answer for you. We did try to put some preliminary data together that will be used as part of the upcoming budget. So. Yeah. Councilmember Briggs, thanks. A couple questions for Mister Steglitz. Thank you so much for coming up, and thanks for all the presentations. I was hoping you could speak a little bit more to the FTE. Edition for the plan review. I think you mentioned that that was coming from. It was going to maybe offset what we've been spending on consulting. I don't know if that was the intent would be we'd be using some of those funds to pay for the FTE, or if we also are going to need the consulting, the intent would be to have an offset. So the FTE would offset the cost of the consulting support to the degree whether we would still need to use consulting to support to augment our staff. It would be sort of TBD. Depending upon what the demand on the services are right now. That's a full FTE. We would anticipate that that would begin to shrink as we brought another person on board. Okay, great. And then I know you were presenting for Doctor Stoltz for the MEU, but just in terms of that phase two study, could you speak to the. Where the funding and that was anticipated to come from? Was that general? Was that. That's a big question. And I wrote her address. Okay. Okay. And then could you speak a little bit more to the separation or the dams being funded partially through parks? I didn't quite recognize that that funding arrangement existed. And kind of historically. What was the thinking behind that? Historically, Ms. Prashant may be better suited to answer that question, but I'll start with my recollection. Originally, the dams were all funded out of the water system. Is that true? No, going back. So we also had a hydro fund at some point, some time ago, the revenue for the two hydro facilities, which are Barton Superior, it was decided to bring those into the general fund. Barton was always split 50 50 between the water fund and the general fund, because again, it provides the impoundment for the water supply. The two other dams, Argo and Gettys, because basically they serve as recreational purposes, were added to the parks fund. And thats the history and thats where it currently. Okay, that's what I assumed. I just wanted to make sure I was making the right, correct assumptions on that. Okay, yeah, that's it for that. Thank you. And then I just wanted to make one, I guess, general comment pertaining to. For Mister Delacourt, you had mentioned. Sorry. Looking scrolling through my notes so I remember what it is you mentioned around the parks or the. Yeah, for. For funding for the parks that, you know, no silver bullet's going to address the funding needs. You know, one of the pieces was taking it, taking a look at properties and potentially how those can meet other council priorities. I guess I would just hope that also that's being thought of as also making meeting park's priorities. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Councilmember Cornell, my first question is for Miss Thompson and thank you to city staff for being here and for your presentations tonight. When you mentioned the parking system on the horizon, you said that the work that you wanted to do is in some way predicated by the increase in the parking lot, the parking rate increase going up. I'm asking you to look in a crystal ball, and I realize that's not fair, so I'm going to say that right now. But do you know of these, because there's four priorities here. Do you know have any inclination what might need to fall off if that parking rate increase does not go through? I would say if the parking rate increase does not go through, we would take a holistic look at our parking system and probably work with our engineers and reprioritize things. I mean, I couldn't pick out one thing, but we would certainly maintaining the safety of our facilities would rise right to the top. So we would take care of critical infrastructure issues first and probably work our way down. Thank you for that. And then I wanted to, I guess, confirm, because, you know, what the TIF capture will be so you can anticipate that revenue. So I assume that everything that is on your TIF system list is. We have the funding for that. Well, when you're talking about the TIF system and we're talking about what's on the horizon, those projects are unknown. Our only planned project right now is the fourth Ave project in 2026 that is programmed. Everything else is going to be based on the work that we are doing this year in planning.

So from the circulation study, from the energy utility study, from our base level of service work that we're doing with the city, potentially the MDOT jurisdictional study, the comprehensive plan, I mean, there are all these things that we collectively are doing as a city, and we know we can estimate what our TIF capture is. And given the cost of goods and services and the increased cost in construction that we are seeing, we certainly won't be able to fulfill all of the potential opportunities that could come our way. I think the one thing that when you talk about quality of life, infrastructure, and sort of the things that we want to do from an economic development perspective to advance the city, that feels precarious to me. And so I think that's something to really think about. As we look at the budget as a holistic framework, how do we prioritize that piece of it in relation to all the other things that we want to do. Yeah. And, you know, as staff, looking on the horizon is our main concern. And as we do this really important work with this development plan, and we will be engaging with all of you. We actually just hired our consultant team at our last DDA board meeting in March. So you're going to start hearing from us and I have to just give a plug. Beginning tomorrow, the comprehensive plan, the circulation study, and the development plan. Public engagement does start at the library. Three days of workshops. A two da.org comma homepage has a link to all the times. I won't bore you with the details, but we're certainly going to be talking about exactly what you're saying. Thank you. My other question is for Chief Kennedy. In your comments to, I think councilmember Ackman kind of asked the question I was going to ask. I apologize if this feels duplicative, but when you talked about the increased demand for ambulance services, I'm not sure if you're saying that there's actually more emergencies happening or if it's just that the staffing for HVA is not keeping up with sort of what the usual is, and then we're having to step in and fill in that void. It's both. Okay? Yeah. Significant increase of calls from calendar year 2023 to 2024. A big chunk of that was with the multiple storm events, but secondary to the storm events was the increase of EMS responses. And that was out of all of our responses, the most. Even with the storm events, September was our busiest calendar month and always is our busiest calendar month coincides with 12,000 freshmen and a bunch of home games that we are repeating this year. And what is becoming again that September always being the busiest month. A lot of those home games in September had been that noon kickoff, which always we see the least demand of noon games are games are always extreme stress on emergency services for the city. The noon games in September were always ones that we took a little bit of sigh of relief with the USC and the Texas game. There's no way those are going to be noon games for where the markets are. And so we're going to see the increase of emergency services calls dramatic for most home games. Excuse me, daily we do between 20 to 30 calls a day. A typical OSU or MSU had always kind of been the peak number of calls we would do every year, and those would be 100 plus. And so we're expecting those hundred plus call days to be instead of two games a year, we're probably looking at four or five games a year. Now. So that's what we're trying to get ahead of. And being able to at least turn on another rig will make a dramatic difference for us to address those peak demands. Thank you, Councillor Gazier. Thank you, mayor. I have a question for Laura Orta. Hi. Can you. Well, firstly, thank you for your report. It was very informative, and it was really great to see some of the things that you're thinking about in the future. I was wondering if you can elaborate on how the new accessibility coordinator, Tracy Byrd, is being utilized and the impact of her position on the city's ability to address accessibility concerns. Absolutely. So Tracy's been on board for about six months, and she's seeing more traffic than I am around diversity and equity. She is a conduit for the citizens and our commission on CODI and individuals within the city. There's one of the things she's diving into are our transition plans. Plans. Parks and Rec just did that really big study, and they're dedicating 30 years to it. Our transition plans are old enough that we need to, in most of our buildings, start looking at at least bringing us up to date for the 2010 changes in the laws. We're allowed to stay with where we created that transition plan, but there will soon be people coming and talking to us about that is what we're hearing from Department of Justice and the Michigan disability groups. Tracy is taking in all of the feedback and utilizing the tools that we have right now for answering the issues. But there are many, and we're also absolutely partnering with areas like DDA and, you know, the comprehensive plan because making certain that we're bringing access there is. She's got her eye on all of it. So I'd say that she's able to do a lot and explain a lot to indivi", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Maintaining the safety of our facilities would rise right to the top.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "A big chunk of that was with the multiple storm events, but secondary to the storm events was the increase of EMS responses.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We're going to start hearing from us and I have to just give a plug.

She's got her eye on all of it. So I'd say that she's able to do a lot and explain a lot to individuals who have already done an amazing job here, our city employees. But there's a lot for all of us to learn and to implement some of the changes. There's still some steps that have to happen that we're looking to streamline a little better. Thank you. I have one quick follow up question you talked a little bit about. I think it was equity champions. Yeah, the ooe. If you could just elaborate that on a little bit, it would be appreciated. Absolutely. So right now, to have, if a staff has a meeting on anything, let's say Brian, they sit down and talk about water and the water mains and things that need to happen. Someone at the table needs to have at least a percentage expertise of what we have. We being the office of equity on thinking about marginalized. That's why we call them marginalized individuals, because they're individuals that we haven't thought of primarily when we have done anything in this world. And so training individuals to ask the questions. Well what about. Right. We kind of joke that we're the uncomfortable questioning asking group within the city. And so training these individuals under curriculum that we're creating with the certifications that we have and my expertise in teaching this subject for years, these individuals will be able to represent. And then looking at the equity report that's related to resolution 18 to something that we submit to council quarterly, we want to have more substantial data to that and those individuals will be able to say they'll give us that really micro view of what's happening in each area so we can report that out better to all of you. Thank you. You know, I thought it was referring to like a disability champions effort. Yes. Just, you know, kind of training at least one member of each commission to have an ADA or accessibility lens so they can point out things in different commissions. We can talk about it more. Yep. But that's absolutely, you know, the DIAJ plus. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions? Well, before turning it over to Mister Hone, I just, I'd like to, you know, thank staff members one and all for, for coming in, you know, we. And well, for coming in. Good luck. I'm thanking you for coming into the building in which you work. Well, darn it, I'm going to thank you anyway. You know, it is, you know, I think what we hear, what I see, and I think the council sees in members of the public who have the pleasure of watching us see, is a set of professionals who come in every day and just work their butts off to think about how they can improve services and enhance quality of life for the residents of the city of Ann Arbor. They do so with grace and vision and they do so in a resource constrained environment. We all were operating here in Michigan, where the political culture over the decades has disinvested in local government and government itself. And that is difficult for progressive communities such as ours, such as ours that are doing everything they can to help and provide outstanding places and spaces for residents and community members. But we are doing it. You all are doing it. And for my part, I couldn't be more grateful. Mister Dohoney. Thank you, mayor. So just a couple of observations before I get the commercial again about questions. The one thing that Chief Kennedy did not mention that will be a factor in the run volume. University of Michigan is introducing alcohol sales starting fall with football. Right, chief? Yes, sir. So when you factor the drinking, that will go on before the game, all during the game, and after the game. Trained professionals, we just know your run volume's gonna go up. I mean, even the hip hop people believe that taming was perfect. It's all good. That's my train of thought. I will not say this will be a top priority or the top priority. I don't like to throw characterizations around like that, but the one thing that our city does not have, and in my professional opinion, must get, is the emergency operations center. If we don't get funding from some source, state or federal, I just. I need to be transparent. I've got to make that happen, because we've been lucky. We've had incidents that have come up weather related. We've had, I don't know that we would have needed to activate it when the explosion happened, but there's a lot of uncertainty that happens within a community. And the way that we do it now, we have perfected the art of talking through teams or in group chats. That's not the way to really handle an emergency. You have to have that center. We need the synergy. It's got to be hardwired, and we need to be in the same physical space to properly respond. So if we're through with a group meeting, when seconds matter, you need to be able to turn to your colleague and say, what about this, and what are we going to do about that today? We can't really do that. So it will be on the top, near the top of our radar until we get it done. If somebody else can pay for it, fantastic.

It is 07:00, so we will get started. Welcome to the Tuesday, April 23 meeting of the Ordinance Revisions committee for the Ann Arbor Planning Commission. There will be two opportunities for public comment. One at the beginning about anything not on our agenda this evening, and one at the end where you can speak about anything you wish. Um, so our first item, I mean, our first session of public comment. Um. Oh, I don't have my script about the. Okay. So I think if you want to speak, you can raise your hand using the zoom raise your hand feature. Or if you're calling in by phone, you can press star nine to speak to the commission. And when called upon to speak, please state your name and address for the record. We'll just give it 1 second. I guess there's no television delay, so we don't really have to wait. Right? This is digital online. Yep. Okay. I'm not seeing any hands raised, so we'll close the public comment, and we will move on to item three, a discussion on a petition for text amendments related to tc one standards, chapter 55, unified development code, and I'm going to turn it over to Stephen. Oh, thanks. We have a petition that has been submitted by a petitioner, so this would not be a staff initiated request, but once, once petitioned, you know, obviously we have a huge hand in how our own code is written. The petition came through midwestern consulting on behalf of the project team and the owner that is developing what they're calling Arbor south. That's officially at 28 45 South State street. We often know it better as 777 Eisenhower, and it asked for. And they are working on the first site plan application that we receive for a project in that is zoned TC one. And they have come across some very practical difficulties in applying the TC one standards. I think they've done a great job working through, and they've been working on this for maybe a year or so. Perhaps their team can really clarify. But they've been working on this for quite a while, and they made a great, good faith effort to apply the standards. Undoubtedly, when you have a brand new zoning district and the first project, you're going to get some questions. And they, I think, have done a good job boiling it down to what really needs some. Some attention. They've asked for five amendments to the standards related to curb cuts, building dimensions, building frontage requirements, some exceptions to the parking structure design, and maybe adding a definition for a block. And in our memo to the ordinance revisions committee dated April 23 today, we've gone through some preliminary analysis of each one of those requests, I'll go through them at a very high level. Also, the applicant team is going to explain how this would, how this relates to their particular project as staff, as the ordinance revisions committee. I'll just point out that although these will benefit or these will apply to their project, these would be applicable to the entirety of the TC one district. And so while I generally would like to work with them, make sure their project is successful, because, and I'm doing this because I think their project does meet the intent of what we wanted in the TC one district. And they have found some details and some practical difficulties meeting our intent, but it would be applicable across the district. And now we've got something like 600 acres of land. I don't know the percentage off the top of my head, but we've got 600 acres of land that is zoned tc one. They've got 23 of those, but they've got actually a small percentage of the total zoning district. Now moving forward regarding their request to address curb cut limits, TC one limits curb cuts to smaller sites get one. Larger sites get two. Outside of the TC one district for comparison, every lot gets one. You get a second curb cut for the second hundred feet of frontage you have, and then your third and additional curb cuts come with every additional 600ft of frontage they've asked to amend. The limitation on curb cuts apply to on the street frontage rather than per site. So in assuming you've got a little bit of a larger site, that would be, that corner lots would have four curb cuts, and maybe if you've got the entire end of a block. So three frontage site, that would be six curb cuts and so forth. As staff, upon reflection, I think the most important aspect that we were trying to accomplish with limiting curb cuts is not necessarily restricting the total number of curb cuts, but we were really just trying to restrict the pattern of curb cuts on a long street so that the driveways can possibly mimic the street blocks of downtown or a more urban area. And so I think that we can support this request. We don't need to necessarily, or we can, and we can support this request by maybe even having one curb cut every 250ft. And that would, would mimic sort of the pattern downtown. It would enable larger sites to have more curb cuts, but probably in proportion ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Midwestern Consulting", "insights": [{"observation": "The petition came through Midwestern Consulting on behalf of the project team and the owner that is developing what they're calling Arbor South.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}]}, {"name": "Arbor South", "insights": [{"observation": "They have come across some very practical difficulties in applying the TC one standards.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}, {"observation": "They've done a good job working through the new zoning district practical difficulties and have made a great, good faith effort to apply the standards.", "classification": "Governance", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Midwestern Consulting", "insights": [{"observation": "The petition came through Midwestern Consulting on behalf of the project team and the owner that is developing what they're calling Arbor South.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}]}, {"name": "Arbor South", "insights": [{"observation": "They have come across some very practical difficulties in applying the TC one standards.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}, {"observation": "They've done a good job working through the new zoning district practical difficulties and have made a great, good faith effort to apply the standards.", "classification": "Governance", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1360, "chunk_end_time": 384872, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUYl4An2ahk", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUYl4An2ahk&t=1s"}, {"start": 4000, "end": 10000, "text": "ve asked to amend.

And that would, would mimic sort of the pattern downtown. It would enable larger sites to have more curb cuts, but probably in proportion to the size of their site. Their second proposed amendment, or requested amendment, I should say, is regarding building dimensions. In the TC one district, building dimensions are limited to 250ft in width parallel to the street, and then for that size, then it's 360ft is a maximum diagonal dimension. These dimensions were roughly based on the blocks the central blocks downtown originally planted. Our smallest downtown blocks. Those blocks are actually a little bit larger than 250. We rounded down, and the petitioner requests an amendment to exceed that 250 foot building with dimension on larger lots. And they've identified that as three acres or more as staff. Yeah, there's a variety of the spice of lights. There's a variety of blocks downtown. Downtown is fairly comfortable for pedestrians. I think there's room for a variety of building sizes in the TC one district. So we generally support this with a little tweak, I believe, as exactly written. And I get that it's not the final language, but sort of is exactly written. I think that they are saying that a larger site, their arbitrary definition is three acres, but a larger site means all of the buildings on that site could be this larger size. And I'm suggesting a slightly different version as a concept, and that maybe the first four buildings on the site should be this smaller size, and then the fifth building and so on and so forth on a larger site could be bigger. And I even say, like, you know, we can even talk about, as an aside, maybe matching the large buildings that, matching the building size to the actual dimensions of a downtown block that was not brought up by them. I'm just bringing it up myself on the premise that we like downtown, maybe we can replicate it exactly. Their third amendment relates to building frontage. Buildings in the TC one district are required to span 70% of the lot width. Again, this is trying to introduce those hallmark elements for a continuous street wall downtown onto these not downtown sites. And for comparison, the D one and the D two districts. We don't have a separate building frontage standard, but we have a minimum and a maximum required front setback. And so the building front is sort of implied. The building goes right at the street to form a continuous street wall. And in the downtown, we allow up to 20% of the frontage to exceed the maximum required front setback for an entry court or a plaza area. Petitioner has requested an amendment to provide some exceptions in the TC one district for certain design features that I think we all support. Public open space, natural feature preservation, plazas, park areas, and so forth. Staff, we thought about this, and, yep, the TC one district could be amended to be more consistent, could be amended. Now, I think I would like to suggest that we move amend them more toward what we've got in the D one and D two. A little bit tried and true. And if we're going in that direction, then the concept would be actually get rid of the building fronted standard in the TC one district and just like downtown, rely on the minimum and maximum front setback and then slightly different from downtown where they give a 20% allowance. We can keep that, keep our same notions, but have a 30% allowance for things like driveways because the TC one district is going to have driveways, there's no alleys, but also those other features that they had mentioned, driveways, sidewalks, plazas, open space and parks, required buffers and so forth. Fourth Amendment that's on the table. Parking structures in my own words, our standards require that parking structures have active uses on their first floor. Doesn't have to be the entire first floor, though, just right up against the sidewalk. The first 25ft of a parking structure building. This applies in D TC one districts. It's not specific to TC one, it's in the parking structure. Use specific standards. The requested amendment would be to allow some exceptions in the TC one district. The petitioner suggested two options. One would be giving an exemption to that active use 30%, or that standard active uses. Again, my words, just for descriptions, there's code language. It's in the middle. But this active use is only applied to the ground floor when you're on a transient street frontage. If you are internal to the site, or if you're on a regular street, a non transit oriented street, then you can have the parking space right up to the edge of the building into the parking structure. Staff we do feel strongly that parking structures are not part of the street wall in a pedestrian oriented environment. But there's probably room for some flexibility here. We do allow, we've got a little bit of flexibility downtown, so there's probably room here.

And then finally, the petitioner requests a definition of block. As staff, we are not opposed to adding this definition, but first, for consistency, for clarity, and just for better code, maybe we cannot rely on block in the first place and therefore we don't need a definition if we use the existing tools that we have and focus on building width, maximum diagonals, minimum setback, maximum front setback, and so on and so forth. And if you and with our building width dimensions, that's basically regulating the building size. And we don't necessarily need to regulate blocks because if you've got a maximum building size, you've got, you've got to space those buildings out. I think, you know, that's one approach to do it. If that doesn't work out, if that doesn't pan out, then absolutely add a definition of block. That concludes my spiel. I wanted to keep it quick and just introduce staff's position. I'll turn it over, or with your thumbs up, I'll turn it over to Tom Colbert to help make the connection between these general text amendments and their actual design. Or at least I think that's what Tom and I talked about talking about. And then we'd like to hear your feedback as the ordinance revisions committee. These amendments will eventually work their way into like code language proposal form, go to planning commission for a public hearing and a recommendation, and then go to city council for approval. And so we very much welcome your feedback about concepts, specifics, or anything in between. Thanks, Alexis. Yeah, Tom, good evening. Are you able to see my screen? We are, yep. Thanks. Awesome. Thank you. Planning commission members of the ORC and planning staff, my name is Tom Covert. I'm with Midwestern Consulting. I'm here this evening with a number of folks from Crawford Hoying, Russell Hunter, Don Brogan and Todd Johnson. Oxford companies representative Andy Andre, architectural design team leads Ben Ritterboss and Matt Cherry, and my colleague Candice Breyer. We'd like to thank you and planning staff for this opportunity to give a brief presentation. I'll try to be brief. I appreciate Alexis giving input on our request, and as you can imagine, on a regular basis we're interacting with developers and property owners looking to develop in the TC one corridor. It's by that lens and the lens of the Arbor south project that we have encountered ordinance items we think might warrant additional consideration. Our goal with our suggestions is to create predictability, limiting risk and uncertainty. I mentioned the Arbor south project lens that has made visible our requests and share with you that the project designers have an evolving, thoughtful concept. This is a bit different than some of the planning commissioners may have seen before at our conceptual meeting. It is a plan that's been evolving, taking input from many different stakeholders. And as I mentioned, we have our designers here at the meeting available to answer any questions you might have or participate in dialogue as you see fit. Alexis had mentioned our request, our first request considering adding clarity or consistent consistency to the allowable number of curb cuts. The TC one codes set curb cuts based upon lot size and lots have a specific definition as a parcel, land planted lot or site condominium lot elsewhere in the ordinance. As pointed out, it suggests that for all other zoning classification, curb cut standards are based upon ownership and contiguous land. And then we have table 5.211 that ties allowable curb cuts to street frontage for those other zoning ordinance classifications. In application of this code, there can become uncertainty. And the uncertainty comes to with regard to what the lot is and what the best parameter for determining the allowable curb cut would be. Just some examples if it is the current lot or parcel configuration that sets the number of curb cuts as seen here. This is a map washma image and we've highlighted the various parcels and condo units that exist at the project property. We might be allowed eight curb cuts if we look at proposed lot or condo unit that informs the number of curb cuts allowed. By example, we may have over 21 curb cuts allowed based on each of the buildings being a different unit in our condominium. And if it's the proposed block that establishes the allowable number of curb cuts, you can see here with the frontage we have on south state, Eisenhower and boardwalk, we might realize about 14 curb cuts based on block length. With application of public road frontage establishing the number of curb cuts or interpretation, we might realize six curb cuts. And this has been what we've used to move our concept forward, limiting any risk to interpretation through an entitlement process that might change, changing obviously the site layout moving for", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Midwestern Consulting", "insights": [{"observation": "The petitioner suggested options for parking structures, noting that staff feel parking structures are not part of the street wall in a pedestrian-oriented environment but showed some flexibility for non-transit corridors.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Crawford Hoying", "insights": [{"observation": "Tom Covert from Midwestern Consulting, representing multiple entities including Crawford Hoying, discussed their ongoing interaction with developers and property owners to create predictability and limit risk and uncertainty in the TC one corridor.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Oxford Companies", "insights": [{"observation": "Oxford Companies made a request to add clarity and consistency to the allowable number of curb cuts based on street frontage.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Midwestern Consulting", "insights": [{"observation": "The petitioner suggested options for parking structures, noting that staff feel parking structures are not part of the street wall in a pedestrian-oriented environment but showed some flexibility for non-transit corridors.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Crawford Hoying", "insights": [{"observation": "Tom Covert from Midwestern Consulting, representing multiple entities including Crawford Hoying, discussed their ongoing interaction with developers and property owners to create predictability and limit risk and uncertainty in the TC one corridor.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Oxford Companies", "insights": [{"observation": "Oxford Companies made a request to add clarity and consistency to the allowable number of curb cuts based on street frontage.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 689296, "chunk_end_time": 1142944, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUYl4An2ahk", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUYl4An2ahk&t=689s"}, {"start": 14000, "end": 20000, "text": "rrent lot or parcel configuration that sets the number of curb cuts as seen here.

And this has been what we've used to move our concept forward, limiting any risk to interpretation through an entitlement process that might change, changing obviously the site layout moving forward. Our requests two, three and four pertain to the interrelated project elements of building dimensions, frontage and block length. Building dimension in the tc one code limits the building dimension to 250ft. We would like to suggest, as Alexis pointed out, that consideration be made for larger building dimension, allowing opportunity to have efficient building design. We'll talk about that a bit further in a future slide, but also consider if the building has a larger frontage dimension. We would need to consider a larger diagonal dimension as well. Building frontage code requires building frontage at 70% of the lot width. Through our concepting, we have learned that we can meet the intent of the ordinance with urban blocks and active frontages, but become limited in ability to include unique pedestrian open space elements along these frontages. These spaces along the frontage may be for natural feature preservation, gathering space or art installation. As code is written, it does not allow for these spaces in a meaningful fashion along the frontage. We would like to have these spaces considered as part of the allowable frontage when calculating conformance to frontage percentage and I'll have graphic definition of this in a bit. And while you're looking at these parameters, as Alexis suggested, we might want to consider a definition of a block. Is it the street or roadway center line, two street or roadway centerline, or the pedestrian space and curb line? Or the edge of the street? Or, as staff pointed out in the review, is the block size controlled by curb cut and building dimension? We think a majority of the projects in the TC one zoning district will be redevelopment sites. We believe there will be future projects that will be land assemblages like ours that have size beyond a typical parcel or planted lot. With an established block, we think there might be inclusion of proportionality allowing for flexibility and block size. This will be an important element of code versus using variance requests as a solution for building dimensions greater than 250ft. Remember, as an example, the Arbor south project is 23 acres in size with established access points and utility corridors, easement agreements and all those things influence block design, building dimension, etcetera. We may be the first property assemblage type project that will need the opportunity for larger block size and building dimension and percentage of frontage. Let's dig into this a bit with some background you can see with our existing condition, we have a superblock which may be more consistent with block sizing. As you move away from the Ann Arbor's urban core, you can see how property and building dimensions access utility corridors. Allowable curb cuts begin to influence our concept and block configuration. Breaking down that superblock, which I think is the goal of the TC one zoning classification in our existing urban areas, we see and staff, confirms urban blocks that take on different sizes as they emanate from Ann Arbor's main street. We see varied block sizes, 250ft might be too small for a large block and 600ft might be too large for large blocks. Maybe an allowed window of or an allowed window of block sizing that leads to proper urban fabric. Taking away the need for variance, or in our case, you know, variants, might mean uncertainty or risk to a developer with a perspective project. In fact, to us, it is almost indistinguishable when you compare our concept with a number of slightly larger blocks to the fabric and cadence of Ann Arbor's urban core. However, with application of the current dimensional standards of building dimension, frontage percentage and block definition, we could not realize this layout without gaining variance. And again, to development and to developers, variances are big risk and create uncertainty for a project. Additionally, the larger building dimension, and in turn larger block length, helps with future proofing our parking structures. One of the things we've been looking at is how can we future proof our parking structures structures? The larger building dimension and block allows the structure to have dedicated ramp area versus each side of the floor becoming ramps. This enhances the opportunity for reuse and repurposing or future proofing of the parking structures. With this slide kind of drilling down to our concept plan, you can look at the occasion where we have blocks that have buildings with dimension longer than 250ft to meet the 70% frontage requirement. But again, in comparison, these slightly larger 250 foot building lengths are indiscernible from existing urban blocks and to us meet the intents of the ordinance creating the urban fabric and cadence with our blocks and buildings.

We have a public space here and we have some public space here for the building and some space here courtyards for the buildings as they front on these right of ways. We think we have a unique opportunity here for pedestrian green open elements. With application of code, these spaces could not exist and would need to have building faces. We would like to see these pedestrian green open elements be considered as part of frontage calculation. Our fifth and final request pertains to parking structures running upon public right of way. As written code requires the first floor for the first 25ft from the front of the permitted or. I'm sorry, let me restate that. As written code requires the first floor for the first 25ft from the front be permitted. Primary use or not a parking structure. We are suggesting that for projects of a larger size and in blocks larger than 250ft, there's an opportunity to interface the parking structure with the public right of way. In our case, the structures are not just for vehicles, but for bike parking and storage and service area access. And allowing for small opportunity of the parking structures to interface with the frontage also aids in wayfinding and ease of access. It also allows for the architectural change along the frontage. Our example of this in the Arbor south project is along boardwalk. Boardwalk is not a designated transit corridor. We will be. This area with the yellow dashed line will be a front door of sorts for a large portion of our office use community, allowing this space to be easily identified and recognized as they visit the site. It will aid in converting vehicle trips into pedestrian trips and it does that without sacrificing the desire or ability to have primary use. Sorry, primary use along boardwalk. This candy striped area is primary use. That is fronting on boardwalk, but we have this little bit of the parking structure that interrelates with the corner. Again, I thank you for this opportunity to share our request with you and our findings as we've worked through our project in the TC one or utilizing the TC one ordinance. We have a great group of designers on the phone or on the video conference here today and would be happy to answer questions or look at graphics and talk through this with you. Thank you. Thank you. All right, so we're now in discussion. Is there anybody who would like to kick us off? Questions or comments? Yeah, go ahead, Dan. Yeah, I'm sorry I wasn't on video. You know what? I was going through the, and thanks very much for the petition and for the presentation. When I was going over the details earlier today, it, the one change that I think I had sort of strong feelings about was the change to the frontage requirements. It felt to me like the other proposed changes in the petition are either fully consistent with the underlying purpose of the district or they're not, but they're not offensive to it. A non offensive changes to the curb cuts in the way that they're calculated, to me, seemed like the kind of thing that legislative amendments often have to tackle. The size of the project in the way, just the way that it is, probably wasn't something foreseeable when the district was being created. And I think that's a change that makes a lot of sense. The changes to the frontage requirement, though, you go back and you read the documents, some of the planning memos from 2021 regarding the importance of creating that street wall effect for pedestrian. The whole point of that 70 30 split in the way the frontage was supposed to be calculated and the way that it was supposed to present on the, on the thoroughfare seems to be an really integral part of what the district was intended to do. And it's hard to, it's hard for me to rationalize, you know, not two years or so, I can't remember when the district was created. I think it was 2021. So we're not that far away from when it was created. Changing that policy judgment, that doesn't feel right to me. And it doesn't feel consistent with what the district was created in part to do, which was to create those streets again, that wall effect that a lot of great downtown blocks have. And when I walk around downtown, the problem that we have on a lot of our blocks are these public plazas and gaps that create dead space. And exempting those areas from the frontage requirement seems to recreate some of the most challenging aspects of our downtown and our TC one districts, wherever they're created, because, again, this is a text amendment. So we're not just talking about your project. We're talking about how TC one will roll out everywhere. Thank you, Commissioner Adams. Maybe it would be helpful to kind of go, to go to the top and work our way down as a way of working through it. I think it's a lot of material.

So we're not just talking about your project. We're talking about how TC one will roll out everywhere. Thank you, Commissioner Adams. Maybe it would be helpful to kind of go, to go to the top and work our way down as a way of working through it. I think it's a lot of material. So maybe we could, mister covert, do you mind maybe just going up to the curb, cut maybe some of the diagram, and maybe I will, just for my own edification, and maybe in case anybody else is having this question, ask planner to Leo, the real. Um, sorry, hold on. I'm trying to find my notes. I think my question is, um. It seems like there are two things that need to be thought about here. So one is just language, right? Like, are we talking about lots, or are we talking about blocks? Or are we talking about street frontage? Like, what is the thing against which we are measuring? And then the second question is whether we want to change the allowable number of openings and have it be more similar to table 5.211 or something. Like. Or, I mean, we could debate kind of the numbers, right? Am I understanding that? Right. Right. I think you're understanding it correctly. I agree. It's both talking about the language and about the numbers. I feel that the intent was similar to the way we do it in every other district, but we, instead of one for up to 100ft in frontage, and then two if you have 101 to 200, and then the third for every incru. I think we wanted, we did want to cut that. Cut that way down and just say you get one or two. And so I, you know, upon reflection, I see where we could have made this simpler, more spread it out. And if we put all curb cut regulations in maximum number of openings, this probably, I think this will address our language issue. That's not what the petitioner requested, but that little staff value added, I think that would address the language issue. I also think that was sort of our, in our intent. We didn't intend to intend to reinvent the wheel, but we wanted to definitely cut it down with that additional. With every increment of 600. We didn't really want that. But here's. But then, but I'm saying now, a new way of staff thinking is, and maybe it's not so bad. Maybe three curb cuts is not so bad. If you've got that much frontage and you're the cadence of downtown if you. If you. We can. I feel like we can work with this. I'm not insisting, but I'm explaining our rationalization and coming to it. So, talking about the language, I think it'll help if we talk about a number of openings all in the same spot in code for consistent language. We've never really had a problem with table 21 one. Now, talking about the numbers, I somewhat put it back on the ordinance revisions committee. As staff, I think it's fine to have another row in that table to say number of openings other than the TC one district, no change. Number of openings in the TC one district and it would be one per insert our number. 250ft. 300ft. 400ft. And my final point, just for discussion. This particular site, I can't help myself. I have to call it 777 Eisenhower. This will get more curb cuts if we change, this will get more curb cuts than what they're currently permitted. And they have a lot of street frontage parcels on the stadium boulevard corridor in particular are very narrow. With this change, we won't get any more curb cuts than we're currently permitted because it's one per lot up to. But some of the biggest sites might get more. But our TC one district covers a variety of land patterns. Lots are very narrow in the west stadium corridor. They're sort of large in the state and Eisenhower area. And Plymouth has a range of large and small. Lots are also very small in the Washtenaw area, very narrow. And this would apply there. But with the change, I don't think we're going to really see more because we already said you get one per lot. Switching to one per every so many feet, I think, is not, as a practical change, not a functional change. My zoom crashed for a minute there, so I apologize if I missed something important, but that's okay. I just rambled on. Do any commissioners have questions or comments about the curb cut? Question I think Commissioner Adams already expressed. I don't know what the right word would be, but it's agreeable, it's friendly. Lack of objection. I mean, Alexis, you live with this, and obviously you're thinking about the implications to making it line up and work with other sections of the code. I was looking at it purely as does it make sense to define it based on lot as opposed to frontage? Now the petitioner is making a good point that defining it based on lot feels, especially as you get very large lots, that doesn't feel quite right to me, so that the conceptual change of moving to frontage makes sense. However you set that up is something that we can hammer out. Yeah, I think that seems reasonable to me. Commissioner Hammershmidt or Mills, do you have objections or questions about that? Okay, I'm good. Okay, thank you. So let's move to then the question of building dimension. Let's kind of maybe take these separately, because I think they raise different issues. So the request is to increase the allowable building dimension. And I think staff has also thrown out the possibility of maybe allowing increased building dimension after a certain number of smaller buildings or 250 foot buildings have already been accounted for.

And I think staff has also thrown out the possibility of maybe allowing increased building dimension after a certain number of smaller buildings or 250 foot buildings have already been accounted for. Yeah. Commissioner Mills. So the question that I've been trying to understand and going back to the UDC, and because the version of the UDC online doesn't have all of the amendments, like, I'm not 100% sure what is fully going on. I have been trying to figure out, are we talking about a single building dimension or the blocks within the development? Because I think that we have a regulation on the size of the blocks, but maybe that's changed. So can you refresh me? I'm like, are these two things separate the a single building and then the blocks within the development? It looks like Alexis is grabbing the UDC, but my understanding is we were regulating building dimension, but because we also have a frontage requirement that building dimension and block length become linked, at least in one of the, like the version of the UDC that's dated the 23 February of 2023 and their subsequent amendments. So, like, this is where I'm just trying to figure out what it is. Once upon a time, the UDC effectively said, in all buildings, when the site is more than 62,500 sqft, it's got to be, it must be designed as blocks 250ft on each side, or as near as practical, given the site shape. The reason that this is so, actually, I'll stop and say that particular question, but just to say that the amendments are published at a two gov.org UDC, if anyone would like to collect those recent adjustments to the TC one district, which Alexis carefully and thoroughly places there, all of our benefit as she plugs away at the 9th edition of the UTC. Thank you. Is anyone else getting a curtain go. Is anyone else hearing an echo when Hank talks? Yeah. Okay, Kelly, for some reason you're. We're hearing you twice, so I don't know. Uh, yeah, Leo, did you want to chime in? Yeah. Um, Commissioner Mills, you are exactly right. The 8th edition of the UDC has a table in the youth specific standards section. So if you're looking at a paper copy, it's going to be around page 61. But some of in working through and we work through. And there was questions about this particular table and some of its standards. And again, the blocks. Well, this says blocks 250ft. Does that mean from building edge to building edge? Does that mean from the out the sidewalk to the sidewalk or the middle of the driveway and so forth. And we have already done one significant change to the TC one standards. I don't have the ordinance number at my fingertips, but the individual ordinances also posted online, as Ms. Kelly mentioned. So it's a separate document now. It will be incorporated. But what it did was it moved the TC one table out of the youth specific standards, inserted it later in the code into the dimensional standards, and we swapped the concept of the sites must be divided up into blocks. For the language that is in the memo and this is the approval language. There's a table 500 1780s instead says that for development arrangement, when the site is more than 62 500, which is about an acre, it must be designed as two or more blocks with sidewalks, plazas and so forth. And there's no dimension there. And that was done on purpose. But there is a dimension about the maximum building size. I recognize that the words maximum building size are not there, but this is like what we're talking about. But this is also one of the details that we're discovering the hard way. It does need to be much more precise. But we removed the. You have to the nitty gritty about making blocks into the implied. We have a maximum building size. Therefore our intention is you make yourself sort of blocks in a regular pattern and you're. So we don't regulate the blocks anymore, but we did. And the maximum building size, though, never changed. It's 250 square, not square feet, 250ft. So, yeah, I'll stop there. Have been answering follow up questions. Now we're getting. Now we're talking my language of super nitty gritty code ordinance language. Well, I wanted to make sure that I wasn't being. Well, I am crazy, but being crazy on that thing. And this is my. The reason that I think it matters is that one of the things that makes really long blocks downtown, not. I mean, you can still tell the difference in the map that you maybe. Maybe this is also earlier in here. Can you go back, Mister Colbert, to where there are that where you showing? Yeah, that one. So. So when you're walking between fifth and division like that is a long block, but it never feels that long because we don't have buildings that are that big. It's the blend. And so. And also, even in the places where it's the small or standard 305 by 305, it's not one building. And so it feels different. There's, like, interest. I don't know. Like, I don't know how to explain it, but it's, like, not monotonous. And I. I want to make sure there's flexibility. And, like, we're sadly never going back to the place where we, like, have all of these individual character, row Housey looking downtown buildings. Right. That all have their different facades.

And so that's what I worry about in changing this standard, especially since the block sizes aren't otherwise regulated anymore. And so, I mean, yeah, changing this suggests to me that we are imagining having some buildings that are the size of a block. And that just makes me uncomfortable in, like, I just don't see how that I. The feel. I don't. I need. Maybe I need to be proven wrong about where this is, and it. And it doesn't feel unwalkable, but, like, that's one of my concerns with this particular change. And so I can see some flexibility in. In maybe there's some times where it's bigger. But, like, this is why I also want this clarity, because we're not talking about block sizes. We're talking about single buildings. And that's just. That's where I am on that one. Commissioner Hammerschmitter Adams, do you have. Okay. Hammersmith. So I think I have similar feelings, and I've been just trying to. So I. On the one hand, like, I kind of get the point of, like, you have a bigger lot. You should be allowed a bigger building, potentially. But I'm kind of. Sarah, like with you. Like, I'm just imagining walking past a building that's exactly the same, looking for, like, a long superblock. And I don't know if we have any sort of ability or purview. Like, the only thing I think that would make me feel okay about that is if you mix up. You made it look, like, more interesting on the front, not like just one building. Like, it could be one building, but it could look like five different buildings. And I don't know if that's even something we're allowed to do because we don't do form based. But I have similar concerns of walking past something that feels like a never ending, similarly looking thing. I mean, I would, I would, as an architect, I'd be really opposed to anything where we mandate, like how many, how many different buildings it has to pretend to look like. But I wondered if anybody from Lord Eck and Sargent wants to offer some perspective about how you approach the idea of designing a 250 foot long or 350 foot long facade. Yeah, I mean, I can, I can chime in here. Tom, do you mind going to our site plan? And if you can take a look at each one of these blocks individually, there's really no area where it's the entire length of the block. Maybe there's like one spot, but we do have some articulation along the frontage. And Alexis, you probably know this better than I do. I'm trying to remember. And if the downtown overlay district has, doesn't it have a requirement where you have to step back? There has to be some sort of articulation in the facade where it can't be one straight street wall the entire length of the block. I'm just trying to think out loud here of what, you know, we took careful consideration of not making these, you know, we're trying to not make super blocks. And so we did break it down and we're creating these moments along the, the street as you walk down. Like if you zoom in, there's like a main street that goes through the middle and it's supposed to be very inviting for pedestrians and slow down movement of vehicular traffic. And it doesn't want to be a large monolithic set of buildings. It wants to be smaller chunks and have these courtyard moments as you move down. And I think, I think that helps do what you guys are kind of hoping to do with not creating large single structure buildings. You have a question, Jay? Well, it's more of a comment. I mean, you know the way, and I'm going to do this a bunch because I don't have any background in architecture design. So I'm only, I can only do what I'm trying to do for better or for worse, you know, reading again. So that the change that I was thinking about was not our good building, our big buildings that take up whole blocks, good or bad. I was looking at it. The TC one district that's enacted by council allows for a building that's 250ft on all sides, so it allows for very large buildings. And I was analyzing the petitioner's change purely from the lens of is 300ft versus 250ft with the difference in the diagonal. Is that something that I should care about. Given what I understand to be true about why TC one was passed and I didn't have any heartburn about it. It didn't feel like, I mean, I think that is a big building. So I definitely hear the comments from the other commissioners about. That's not something I'm used to walking by. So I don't really have a good sense for, whether it's good or bad. But in terms of the petitioner's request, I didn't have any heartburn over the fact that it's moving from 250 to 300. It's big. I'll concede that. Yeah. I mean, I would just, I guess, maybe add that there.

I understand, and I know Commissioner mills in particular will have some anxiety about relying on, you know, the good design sensibility of the development teams and architects who happen to bring proposals before us to do this. So I think we want something to ensure that we don't, you know, end up with a, you know, monolithic, massive, undifferentiated facade right at the street. But I also, I mean, just really quickly, because I didn't have much time, but I just looked downtown to see is there anything that is this dimension? And the parking garage at fourth and William across from bleak, it's facade along fourth, in my quick Google Maps measurement is 300ft. So I think we could look, we could take a minute, and not tonight, in the intervening weekend or weeks, and look around for other examples in town of buildings that are approximately 200 to 300ft, and check them out. And just because I think it's something that you probably have to have a kind of, you need to get a physical, visceral sense of what that is. I think it sounds bigger than it is. But I also understand that we should, we could consider certain ways of some kind of form based language that would require some differentiation in the setback or in the street wall. So maybe, Alexis, my taking the temperature, it seems like there's some hesitation here to just make it bigger. Without a bit more analysis of what that would mean. I'll just say that it's fine. That is the purpose of tonight. Yeah. Okay. So then the next question, I think, was about building frontage. So this is, you know, now, just to be clear, you have a building, it's on a, it's on a block of some kind, it has some sheet frontage. And so this, the current requirement is 70%. Right. So of your block, no more than 30% of that can be open space or plaza, etcetera. And if I'm. If I can be loudmouth and talk again because I had. I had issues with this one. The February 21 staff memo to or to this body. New buildings must be placed to create a street wall along the transit corridor. The intention statement from the TC one district itself. Pedestrian friendly designs are critically important in this district. The flexibility that was baked into the regulation, was that 30%. That's where the flexibility is. We were. I have to think again. I'm imagining that planning staff, orC, and council all could have made a different policy choice, but they. They weighed. They wanted to create that street wall, but they acknowledged that you're going to need that. It can't just be building from curb to curb. So you got 30% to play with. And I just don't read. I don't read TC one or any of the documents that fed into it as tolerating big carve outs and exceptions and gaps in open space. That's just not what the district was intended to do. Thank you, Commissioner Hammerschmitt or Mills, do you have comments or questions about the frontage? Yeah, Commissioner Mills. I want to make sure that I'm reading this right. I mean, I agree 100% with Commissioner Adams here. And also I want to make sure that I'm understanding what we have right. That this is applying to, like, all of the sides of the blocks. Is that right? Like, it's. If in this case, where there are new streets that are created internally, that frontage requirement, does it. It applies to both the transit corridors or the existing Eisenhower and state, but also to the roads that are inside. Is that right? I think this is a little bit of the crux. Like, now that you put this into application, the word is frontage. It is defined in some places that sort of imply that it's street frontage. And then, yeah, I would there. I would. I would not necessarily apply this internal to the blocks. For the side or the rear of these internal blocks. Those are not streets, actually, in point of fact. In point of fact, the layout that they've got going on is they're not even private streets. They would be regulated as parking lot and driveway, because there's a specific definition of private street. What they've got are driveways and access points and vehicular circulation that mimic or that read as streets. And in the end, the design is perfectly fine. But here's part of the issue. Exactly, that we're talking about. We're talking about, we're regulating building frontage, but that's a little bit of a term of art. And so, therefore, how do you apply it when you are not doing it between public street and public street, when you're doing it between one public street on one side but a driveway on the other, or between pedestrian muse? And so that's the regulatory question for clarification that's before us tonight. Wouldn't another question be that it says 70% of lot width and the lot here is not. Doesn't align with the block? Yeah. Yeah. And I for clear going to the site plan, just so we can look at the existing street frontage as it's currently designed. Thank you. Yeah. And while he's pulling that up, I should just say our staff position is I don't want less than 70. I don't really want less than 70% of building frontage or presence. But.

And while he's pulling that up, I should just say our staff position is I don't want less than 70. I don't really want less than 70% of building frontage or presence. But. But I wonder if it could be articulate, like, literally explained better so that we still can get pedestrian muses between buildings, so that we still can get faux streets and so forth. I don't. I don't. I'm not really trying to support reducing the 70%. I'm wondering how can we rephrase it so we still basically get the 70%, but it is easier and more clear to apply. We don't have to have these discussions about when and where do you stop. Is it the lot? Is it the site? Is it the block? That. That's where I see there's room for help. Thanks, Commissioner Hammerschmitt and then Mister covert. Oh, sorry. That was. I was going to say that question led to more questions, but. Okay. I know. Okay. No, you can do it, Sarah. Well, what. What I was getting at, and I appreciate you bringing this up, is, like, I was not clear if this was necessary because of what's happening in the middle of the site or if what's happening along State street. And if it's what's happening along State street in particular, then, like, if we're not even applying this within the site, we're only applying it to the frontage, then I'm really not cool with reducing that percentage. But that's, I guess I need to understand, like, where the pain point is from the developer. Commissioner Hammersmith, would it be helpful to have mister? I think so, yes. To us. What's going on again? Okay. Yep. Thank you. So one of the things when we're looking at frontage and the percentage requirement, if we're considering the lot, then we're considering a point here to a point at the corner, and then corner to corner and then corner to property line here. If we're looking at we've been applying the frontage requirement on a block basis with a measurement from center line to property line or center line. In the case over here, broad boardwalk, center line to center line. So we are eating up percentage or feet in half of the roadway width, you know, the pedestrian space or element? Pedestrian space, element, and the roadway. If we're measuring, and I heard Commissioner Adams say from curb line to curb line. So there's like this notion of where are we measuring that from? From the frontage as an overall dimension. Are we measuring it on block? You know, block dimension, percentage to foot? So that if, if we're looking at it, we just want to make sure we're applying that, because we may meet that if we're applying it to partial, you know, the whole partial line or overall. So, but if we're going from block to block, we are really having dimensional space that's tied up in the complete street, if you will, the roadway, half the roadway, the pedestrian space, the walking space, and that kind of thing. So I think what we're really looking for is clarity in that measurement. And just to confirm, you're only thinking about the 70% requirement on state Eisenhower and boardwalk and not interior to your project. Correct? That's correct. Those are the public right away is correct. Okay. And that aligns with what planet DeLeo is saying, but maybe is answers a question that Commissioner Mills had. Okay. Commissioner Hammersmith. Oh, did you have something else, mister Covert? Or was that it? I do not. Thank you, Mister Hammerschmitt. Yeah, I mean, I guess my main thing is just sort of like how, like, especially on a block like this, where you have these internal streets that, you know, lead to more things like, I guess I have a question of on a. If it was just one block, would their curb cut to, like a parking lot count in that 30% of non building? I think the answer is yes, but I don't know. You want me to weigh in on that? Yeah, we're looking at you. I don't know if anybody else knows the answer. Yeah, I think when you are, I think it's pretty clear if your site is tiny compared to this one, and the building needs to be, you know, it says the building is 70% of the lot width. Let me get the exact phrase. Building shall be 70% of the lot width, provided this allows 30ft between the building and the side lot line normally, or 45ft between the building and the side lot line when you're adjacent to residential zoning, extra 15ft because conflicting land use buffers 15ft wide. Um, so it's real. Like if your, if your lot is 100ft wide, we want it to be 70ft of building, 30ft for your 24 foot wide driveway and 3ft on each side. Example. But when you have a frontage that's 900ft long, I'm ballparking like Eisenhower. Well, does that, you know, I should have said 1000ft long. Yeah. If your, if yours is a thousand feet long, do you want buildings 700ft? And then that leaves 300ft. But you know, do you want more? Do you want less? And then of that 300ft, is it okay to have just 30 foot driveways? Can you have one driveway, one muse? Can you have a c shaped building? All these are, you know, design questions that don't apply when you've got a hundred foot wide lot on stadium, but the questions that do apply when you have a thousand feet of frontage on Eisenhower or Plymouth. Okay. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, like my gut and I figured you were going to say like that.

Okay. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, like my gut and I figured you were going to say like that. The driveway to a parking lot or to whatever would count. Yeah, but in this case, because it's like the intern, like it's leading to something else. So I'm like, do we, if we're looking at this as like one site and not a block and not like block by block, which is sort of how I would think that we should look at it, like maybe if it's, maybe if it's not just a curb cut just to get to parking, it can be exempted from the total calculation. Yeah, I don't know. This is kind of, I think, though I'm happy to keep on discussing it. But just so you know, I'm definitely getting the sense that like the continuous street frontage, the street wall, you know, minimum 70% is very important. I'm just going to assume that you understand that you're understanding and can work with different ways of expressing this that might be clearer, but I get that. Like, it's very important to make, to even maybe increase the amount of building frontage, but be clearer and how it's applied and we can come back. This probably, almost certainly is an iterative process. And I think for my purposes as staff, what I'm sort of hearing is, don't change the intent of this particular amendment request, don't change the basic parameters. Just clarify the existing language if necessary. And so, you know, we can move, we can still discuss it, but I do feel I get the sense that we can continue working and continue this iterative process. That's where I'm at. What's that? So that's where I'm at. That's where you're at. I just want to offer one more comment, which is that I think there's a really big difference between 70% curb to curb and 70% lot lot line to lot line. Because if you do not account for the roadway and the public right away, the sidewalk and stuff, you have a lot less building fronting. You have a lot less building at the street wall. It's a lot more, it's a lot more. There are a lot more gaps if you do it curb to curb as opposed to lot line to lot line. So, and I think generally what we're trying to go for is as much building kind of at the street level, pedestrian friendly as we can get, and have it still be kind of a friendly space. But I think this idea that in a kind of dense urban fabric, we need little, that we need kind of plazas in front of buildings or c shaped buildings with little plazas or pocket parks. Like, I think if we look around, we can see a lot of examples of those that don't actually work as activated space. So I just would, those are, I'm just putting my kind of preference on the table here, which would be to make sure that we're getting a good amount of street frontage, we're not reducing it building at the buildings to the street frontage, I guess, to be more clear. Okay. Any other comments about percentage of street frontage? And I agree with you, or. I understand Alexis. I think it's a two stage process. Maybe the first step is to just clarify the language, like in how are we measuring and what are we measuring? Then we can debate the numbers after that. Right. So block definition, this was a bonus. Oh, no, wait. What about parking structures? That isn't showing up here in the presentation? But that was. Oh, here it is. Sorry. So I think the proposal here that planning supported consideration of would be allowing parking structure frontages on non tc one transit or non transit corridor streets. Commissioner Millis, do I see your hand up? Yeah, yeah. And I'm having troubles figuring out the buttons today. So it was earlier when you brought up the parking garage that's on, that's across from Blake. That is actually my example of like, the worst block to walk down. It's like, I mean, in terms of what's going on, it's long and there's nothing else happening there. And like, so I would love to not see more of that. Like, that is not an inspiring block to walk on at all. Well, we're never gonna have 300ft of parking garage on the corridor. Well, I mean, I guess that that's the question that I have is like how would this then apply? Like how much I'm curious about what the dimension is that is on the kind of on the plan and what seems reasonable. Like, yeah, we've got a lot of, you know, it's different than walking past the one that's a couple blocks up across from armada or in literati. Right. Like it's shorter. I don't know. Especially in the east west dimension. Yeah. So what does it look like on. Actually the. Yeah, so that's my, that's my sense. The one by literati. Whoops. Hold on. Okay, now my Google Maps is being weird. So never mind. The other building that is about 300ft is 618 south main or the yard. Those kind of face each other, but they're both about 300ft long, I think too, as a reference. But now that I understand that we're only talking about boardwalk, state and Eisenhower, those are the only ones that would be regulated by this parking structure limitation. Or is that not true?

Well, in point of fact or point of clarification, as written right now, all of those parking structures, their ground, the ground floor has to be active use for the first 25 foot of depth. And the only exception would be for the actual driveway to get into the property construction. That's true. Internal to the site or only on Eisenhower, state and boardwalk it is. It says any parking structure adjacent to the street. But you said these aren't streets. Yeah, right. See, see, adjacent to the street must be, must be so activated. So this would apply then to state, Eisenhower and boardwalk. And they have, they're basically requesting a little bit of relief via an amendment. And of the two options, and so you tell me maybe you disagree with my little preference, but of the two options, one option would be keep it as written for state and Eisenhower. But on boardwalk it could have zero active use on it. If we're saying this only applies to in the tc one district transit corridor designated streets, that would be the text amendment. Their other option to consider would be say 70%. The frontage on the street has to be active use and that would apply all three streets. But there's a bigger allowance for not active. Not activated. Yeah. Commissioner Adams, I agreed with the staff recommendation here. I thought that the, as between the two, the two types of relief the petition requested, offering relief on the non transit corridor side where maintaining and creating street wall. Again, going back to the purpose and legislative history of the document, seemed less important to me to create and preserve that on boardwalk. And if that, if that. If changing that language makes it possible to facilitate more projects, not talking about this one specifically, and gets us the street wall that Congress or that council wanted to create on state and Eisenhower, I feel like that's at least worth considering. I'm not saying it passes, but it feels possible. Commissioner Hammersmith, I also agree with staff's recommendation, and I'll leave it at that. I think it's fine with the non tc one streets. I also think it's probably fine. I think I would want to. I just would want to take a minute and go look at the corridors and think about. I think between now and the next time we talk about all of these things, I want to think about them as generalized conditions and not just for this site. Right. I think that's the due diligence that we have to do. But I think in principle, I agree. Is there another comment that you just made me think of that's unrelated to this? I think when we did tc one, we were just sort of looking at them. At least. I was as like, here is a parcel and then here is a parcel next to it. And I wasn't really thinking about these larger assemblages that could take up like three street frontages. So I think, like your point? Like, we all should probably take a closer look at the streets that we rezoned. Like, what the heck's behind stadium? Like, I don't know. I haven't really thought get deep into the site and like, what happens if this happens all over the place? So I think with these, like in, in light of this, and this is a really interesting first cc, one project to have, because it's not just like one parcel. So in light of like the things that these petitioners have brought, I think us all kind of going and doing that and looking at these things, like on stadium, on other parcels along state and Eisenhower, on Plymouth, on Washtenaw. It's good homework for us to do. We like homework at the Orc, right? Yes. I think the last thing on the memo was about, or the report was about the definition of a block. And the suggestion in the report was that we might be able to just drop the word block altogether. That maybe the first thing to do is refer to language that we use elsewhere in the UDC and see if we can articulate what we need to without using the word block. Is that right, planner Deleo? Yeah, I can't guarantee that that, but I wondered if I feel that that should be explored. Yeah. My only question, and I don't. You maybe have thought about this already and maybe there's an apparent answer, but I think the one thing that doesn't get accounted for in lots, frontages, building size, et cetera, are like pedestrian cut throughs. Or maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe if we have a street frontage percentage and we don't have, we don't anymore regulate the dimension of a block. So you could, you could have 3250 foot buildings spaced along one massive street frontage. Right. As long as each building isn't more than 250ft. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense to me then to, yeah. To basically begin with that wordsmithing project and see where that leads. I mean, clearly it's been very helpful to the, just to the petitioner has been very helpful to have all this brought to our attention. There's obviously a lot of clarity that we can bring in addition to maybe thinking about changing or tweaking the actual regulation, but just clarifying where we're measuring and what's being required, I think is very helpful feedback.

So thank you. Thank you for the opportunity. Is there anything else to discuss, then, about these amendments to tc one? Yeah. Mick's Kelly, I just wanted to clarify what I heard taking notes throughout the conversation this evening. Can you hear me without an echo? Yes. Okay, great. I put in your question. So for curb cuts, the committee members have no objections to the staff proposed proposal for building dimensions. This was while I was changing out my, my audio, but I have that this needs further discussion. And we. There wasn't a clear consensus right now. Yes, that item. I think there was a sense that if we were to substantially increase allowable building dimension, we would need to consider potentially some other kind of form based code that would ensure differentiation along the facade or something like that. And just as an aside, Mills, the other building that you're going to be very familiar with, which is 300ft, is city hall, along fifth. So, yeah. So is that a fair characterization to the other commissioners? Like some hesitation about increasing the size, and also if we were to increase the size, some way to think about differentiation. Okay. Okay. So hesitation, which could be alleviated with design regulation. Yeah. And I also think, my sense is that people would be open to larger buildings only on much larger sites. So where that threshold is, maybe it's up for discussion, but I think purport, it says something about like five acres or something like that. Three acres. So for building frontage, the ORC supports staying close to the intent of the zone, but we want to start first with clarifying how we would apply it and then have a second path discussion to consider how that would be applied, how clarified regulation would affect project. For example, like the 28 45 south state 777 Eisenhower. Okay. Parking garages. I heard agreement from Adams and Hammerschmitt to go with the staff recommendation for relief on non transit streets. And from Abrams, you were leaning towards staff recommendation, but would like to think about how this applies to other corridors. So mostly support for staff recommendation, but let's consider how this applies more generally in tc one. And finally, for the block definition, my takeaway was that the building frontage conversation may illuminate what we want to do with this because we might have better understanding of how we're backing ourselves into blocks and buildings if we figure out better how we are applying building frontage requirements. Yeah, sounds good. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Anything else? TC one amendments. All right. Then we will move on to the next agenda item, which was UDC simplification continued and I don't. Staff didn't prepare a staff thing. Or is this just about maybe an update from Commissioner Hammerschmitt Mills and myself about what work we have done and also maybe beginning to loop Commissioner Adams into the conversation? Yes. As a preface to that, I'll just say that I know it has been the scope of ORC due to staff capacity and also trying to stay within the approved work program. It seemed like it was a little hard to get traction with the homework model. So I don't want to. I just want to leave it open that I don't want to force the committee to stick with that. Because this particular item, the TC one text amendment, will take up quite a bit of staff time, and it has some time sensitivity for the developer they're proposing. I mean, they've requested a presubmission meeting date, and it's a serious proposal, you could say. And so we want to make sure that city regulation isn't standing in the way of good development. So I think that this could take us into the next ORC meeting. I also want to just connect to a little bit of uncertainty around new work that may be coming down from the new resolutions that city council passed. There were a variety of requests that relate to zoning regulation, planning, planning department process that will, some very likely involve the ORC so that we can use you as a sounding board. I know that upcoming, although it was not ready for this evening quite yet, we will be bringing forward some amendments to stormwater. Ordinance manager Leonard is working on that with some staff in public services. We're also going to be proposing some changes. These are out of necessity. They're not on your work program, but they're arising out of operational necessity, some changes to the pud ordinance, and that takes us into June. So I just want to just put that out there for adding to this discussion of the UDC simplification, because anything that is discussed here, the idea is that, you know, serious proposals to amend would go back and staff would work on them. But there's, I think, kind of like an order of priorities here, because if there's not a very clear sense from you all of what you want to prioritize with that, then we could, we definitely have other work that could occupy the time for the committee.

Thank you for all of that information. It reminds me that, I guess one question we didn't answer in terms of the TC one amendments would be next step, like do our things. Does it sound like maybe the next step would be to go to a working session for the full commission or coming, do you think things would come back to RC in June that hasn't necessarily been determined, but because of this, you know, sort of was previewed and started at a working session, and if we are able to make progress on it, we don't want to lose momentum. I would definitely entertain bringing it to a working session. I didn't have that, a pretty determined idea of that. I don't think it would be inappropriate to bring it to a working session, since you all have already talked through some of the finer points and could help to contribute to that discussion. And I feel like we had, by and large, consensus around most of the points. I think if there were things that felt very thorny and not a lot of consensus among the committee, it would make sense to bring it back here. But I could see this moving to a working session of the full commission next. And if that were so, that would mean June. The June agenda would include potentially revisions to the stormwater ordinance and also to the pud for June, depending on readiness. Yes, for the puD, but definitely stormwater. That was like, is there the possibility of room in the June agenda to discuss something? Therefore, we could plant the seeds of that tonight and work on it between now and then, or whether June is full. So it sounds like it's 50 50. We're not sure. Well, I do know right now that the June working session is not full, and that would be on June 11. Yeah, no, I'm talking about whether Orc should try to work on any zoning simplification is that the language we're using. Yeah. UDC simplification between now and then or not. That is what, given the information I've provided, you can now discuss amongst yourselves. I just wanted to provide context so that you didn't feel pressured to. I think there's plenty of content for you to consider without that pressure. If you would like to please discuss. Okay. I feel like I've asked a lot of questions, so maybe I'll pause for a minute and see if other commissioners have a sense. And also, Commissioner Adams, maybe you have no idea what we're talking, what we're referring to because you've been given no background. There's a kind of very nascent but long standing, I think, conversation, emerging conversation about a desire to simplify, to think about simplifying. Certain aspects of the UDC primarily focused on zoning categories and the use and the use table. So, for example, we have some zoning categories which are almost identical, which we could potentially consider collapsing as a way of simplifying the EDC. Or we have different use classifications in the table, but like all of their permitted and special exception uses are almost the same. And we can think about also having fewer total of those. So that was a project that was maybe initiated by Commissioner Sovey before, for she departed and she had put together a spreadsheet that was kind of looking at the use table and looking at the use classifications that had very similar uses and proposing kind of ones we could smush together. I think Commissioner Mills and Hammerschmitt did some work looking also at the UDC and looking at just zoning categories for ones which are similar. And so I think we have a, we are beginning to have some ideas about places where we could focus our attention and think about the ramifications, the benefits of some of that work. But because of the comprehensive planning process and departures on their team, I think the planning staff have not had a lot of bandwidth to like, this isn't something they actually have the bandwidth to contribute to. They have their plates full. So it was kind of like quote unquote homework that we were doing on the side. But at some point we would need to kind of formalize that work and I think share it with planning staff and move it towards something actionable. Yeah, go ahead, Commissioner Adams. I mean, that's a huge project. I don't have to tell they've done things like that at the congressional level and they take years. And the problem is you can't do it piecemeal. Right. Because the person that if you do a chunk, you got to make that chunk connect to all the other chunks and they've all got, they've got to sync up. So it's almost got to be one or two brains. I mean, you'd probably, I mean, I've read enough of the UDC to know there's probably pieces you could break off. But I would worry if, like, even if, you know, sit down and take a chunk and you say, I'm going to simplify it, it would be inconsistent or incompatible. That's part of the reason why it's kind of a mess. The way that it is now is that it's been amended and pieced together different times, that there's sections of it that don't make sense.

Yes, I think you're right. I think there are, like, as a small example, it's been pointed out that like, m one and m one a, which are like manufacturing districts, have the same dimensional standards, they only have one variation in their use table. And so that would be a very easy thing to probably combine. But we also could say, well, what's really the impact of that? Is that worth the time and the effort that it might take? But maybe there are others which are also things we could bite off which may have more impact looking at some of the commercial districts. But you are right, I also. Yes, it's a big thing, and there are other kind of big things like conflicting land use buffers, bike and parking, ev kind of chunks of the ordinance that need, that could use some attention and updating at some point soon as well. So, yeah. Commissioner Hammersmith, for what it's worth, I've kind of been having fun. I don't know if fun's the right word, kind of reading through the UDC just to see like, where. Because, you know, a lot of times I'll just like, look through for like, the things that I need, but I don't know that I'd ever like, and I don't think that I finished yet, but, like read it consecutively. And I think, like, I'm happy to continue to do that and just like note my notes in that document for what they're worth. The things that I was mostly noticing, I think are really they're gonna be. And I think I mentioned this up to some of you after like our last in person meeting too. Like, there's like eight pages talking about, like, what was it? Like the floodplain or something? Like just wade through that to get to the next section. Just like there's so much in there in the way that it's currently organized makes it really hard to find stuff unless you do a control app. And trying to think of it as, like, coming from, I guess I am a developer now, coming from the perspective of a developer, like, it was almost impossible. And I, we work. I was, I was on planning commission when we redid the sign ordinance, and I was still like, I don't know how to find in here. Like, what? Like, what is my project? What type of sign? Like, it's just really hard the way that it's organized because it's like, I'm a residential developer, what applies to me. I'm an office developer, what applies to me. And we have it set up kind of in like the reverse. So for me, I think it's more, I think, like, the donning stuff, hopefully will come through the comprehensive plan. So spending time on that right now might not make sense. Like, hopefully that's a takeaway from this. But a lot of it for me is just like, the length and the organization just makes it really hard to read and to find the things that you're looking for quickly. Yeah. Commissioner Mills, as you were talking, Commissioner Hammerschmitt, the first. How many years, Miss Celio, that I was on Orc, we were finishing up zorowing this. This is so much more legible than it was before, and there's still room. And the whole idea behind Zorro as the zoning ordinance reorganization was to make it so that we could see where there were conflicts and make it easier to read. So, but it's great that we have Mister Leo on this because she, in terms, if anybody is going to, like, collapse things, it should be Mister Leo because she has read the whole thing. I agree. I don't think that there's any. So I did go through, and I don't, I mean, I thought it was fun, but it was also some work to go through and figure out, like, where are there, might there be opportunities to collapse? And so I kind of feel like I don't want that to get lost because it's not going to change those things. Right. Like, aren't going to change. And so if, if this does move up the priority list, I want to hopefully have that coupled with Commissioner Sovet's use table collapsing analysis. I think that that's a real strong starting point. We took this on in part because this was when we voted on UDC prioritization, or, I'm sorry, on Orc prioritization. Like, this was one of the things. And I, you know, we did the homework because we said, if staff doesn't have time. Like, we still want to move this priority forward. So I'm curious, in light of the things that have gotten put on our plate, maybe we ought to look at what is on Orc's wish list, what was on our prioritization list wishlist for the next fiscal year, because that's coming up. So we can see, like, should this, should we do, like, gradually do a little bit more, or should we just put this on ice and move on to the next thing? Yeah, that's my sense. If I may, although I think the work plan might be revisited around the time of the fiscal year. It was organized in calendar years, not fiscal years. So when it says 2024, that is intended to mean until December. I. In previous conversations with Miss Dalio, I'll let her speak for herself. But our understanding of the zoning simplification was not chiefly zone collapse. It was more early successes of just strike through language reorganization for clarity, things that mostly just removing language.

But our understanding of the zoning simplification was not chiefly zone collapse. It was more early successes of just strike through language reorganization for clarity, things that mostly just removing language. The benefit of just truly simplifying in ways that we could push out and just actualize quickly. Not that eventually the. The district consolidation wouldn't be part of that, but that is something that we're hoping our paid consultants will weigh in and put their intellectual effort toward. And then we could pick it up from there, because after the comp plan is updated, we'll have to have a conversation. And hopefully this is being previewed, or will later in the process with the complaint subcommittee is, what are we going to do about updating the UDC? How do we want to go about it? Do we want it full overhaul? What are the recommendations that have serious bearing on that? And district consolidation is an obvious and core part of that. So I was, my takeaway was that the zoning simplification work of this subcommittee right now was not primarily the work of the zone consolidation, but I don't know. Miss Dalio, did you have thoughts on that? You had expressed some reservations to me before about, like, cart before horse with that type of thing. Yeah, I agree. I think that there's a difference between simplification and, like, the zone collapse. Zone collapse, I feel like, would also include map amendments. You know, like, you gotta. If you're gonna get rid of a district, what? You gotta. You gotta deal with the map, and I'll just leave it at that. Yeah, that was my understanding as well. And there can be a lot involved in simplification, I think, to developer Hammerschmitt's point, but also Sarah Mills. It is structured a ton better than it was because it wasn't a single document before, but, you know, I personally had hoped to somewhere get around to very consistent language. The triggers can be different, but the consistent language for application. When does each section apply? Do you. Which is not there? And things like that, I think are some small, some can have some big impact on folks. Um, and then again, like, you're just reading through. Um, I think we regulate to the nth degree sometimes, and we don't need to anymore. And so just, you know, and it would be some surgical strikes, but it just make. It might make it a lot easier to interpret and. And enforce and. Yeah. So now I'm getting into the weeds because I like this stuff, but I'll just say. Agreed. Agree with Hank, I think. Yeah, there's a difference, though, between zone collapse and just simplification. Plain language, that kind of work. Commissioner Hammersmith. So I agree with both of you, and that's how I was doing. My read, for the most part, was. Was I found some scrivener's errors, so I noted those. And I. And I, like, noted places where I was like, this has a lot of words, but I don't know that, like, I don't want to just start, like, doing surgery on these paragraphs either. So, like, I don't. I don't know the best way to, like, do that, except just to note where I'm, like, I feel like we could say this more concisely and maybe that's, like, an okay first step. I don't know. But that's sort of how I was also approaching this. So I'm gonna just keep doing it in my spare time. And I'm glad that I didn't see this before you guys zeroed it together. Yeah, I mean, I think I am hesitant to kind of collectively agree to do homework if we are being told, which I think we're being told that there's not staff capacity to support that work moving forward in the near term. So, like, we could work on stuff, but it doesn't. Even if we worked on some of those, like, simplification and clarification question or things around language that hank you. And that makes Kelly and Miss Leah were just describing, I don't think staff would be able to take up that as a project before, I don't know, 2025. I don't know. Or the fall or. I'm not sure what the timeline is, but it certainly doesn't seem like that's something which is going to happen in the near future. So if we're not making changes to the zoning map, which really should, in a comprehensive way, be done through a comprehensive plan? Yes. We can take on suggestions for section reorganization, language simplification, and plain language proposals for clarity to get clear development. I mean, a lot of what we were discussing tonight was clear language. How does this apply? Interpretation questions. And there are sections that are much more tested and have known issues than application of tc one where this would be, you know, a small change could have a really helpful effect. And we did have this slated for 2024 to take on and make, make staff time for. So, yes, we would just. That particular piece of district consolidation and collapse and how that would play out through the city, that would require a lot of public engagement and would have a lot more property implications than some of the other types of changes. Got it. It's a worthwhile effort, but it feels like a very different exercise. Got it. And I'm going to put changes to conflicting land use buffer or bike anything.

Okay, so that's in the, that's in the plausible category. Yeah. If we acknowledge some of those, have a roll up of suggestions, some discussion, and you want to say, okay, staff, these are the things that we want to simplify. We have the rough draft. Let's move this into a amendment proposal and take it to the full commission. Yeah, absolutely. I think what we're lacking is a little bit of the direction for what those particular areas are. If you want us to go back and suggest a few places to just narrow the focus of the discussion, we could do that, but it was left kind of wide open at the discretion of the subcommittee. You know, read through it. What do you. There's a lot of things to improve, but if you want staff to help narrow that field, then we can think about that and come back with some ideas. And then just to review the, our quorum and meeting rules. The quorum for this committee is three. So no more than two of us can, like, meet, meet for coffee and sit down with UDC and talk about it. So. But we can communicate. But we can communicate over email. Am I right about that? Not on substantive matters. That would be construed as like a back and forth where you're making a decision as a quorum. Okay. I guess what I was wondering is like, it's 845. We have one more public comment session. We need to kind of move on. But I want to figure out where is the space where this committee could discuss what they want to, what they want to do. If anything, it's right now. It's only right now. I wasn't sure. Is that the kind of thing we can discuss over an email or not as a quorum? Right. Like, individual emails are fine, but if it's four of us or three of us on a, on a email exchange, that's a, that's a meeting, right? If you're talking about something more than basic logistics of, hey, we're meeting here, or here is this document link. Like, if you're discussing the substantive matter of the committee, this is my understanding, you know, I'm not an expert in this. Just have. So I guess it depends what you want to sort out. You could, I think you had two working committees before, and then commissioner Selvay left the planning commission, and I'm not sure how exactly you all had divided work. We didn't. We never really have subcommittees. I mean, we talked about it, but we kind of just worked individually and just haven't talked. We mostly talked about how we couldn't talk. Right. We emailed about time to meet. Okay. So maybe quickly then, we could just try to come to some agreement about, between now and June. We could do nothing. We could each individually continue to look through the UDC and flag things. That might be the kinds of editing and clarification that Alexis and Hank described. We could decide to work on clubs and come back in June with a proposal about that. We could do something else that isn't on my radar that one of you has an idea about. I was using that as an example of something we had already done that would fall in that category. We're going to look at clubs again. Oh, okay. Got it. I mean, we did just look at them, but if there's more to do and it's a, it's. Everyone agrees. Okay, well, we did punt on, we did punt on variable club. Like, with that related to the parking lot and, like, downtown parking lots versus. And, like small parking lots and backyards. Um, there was a potential next phase. I think my vote would be at this point. We don't, I don't think we have a kind of, like, we're not consolidating around an idea, so maybe it's best to just individually, if we want to, and have time, look at the UDC and at our next meeting, we could put on the agenda some time to talk about whether anything is coming up out of that that we want to formalize. Yes. Commissioner Mills, one of the things that strikes me in going through my analysis, that's not zone collapse version, but the bike parking and ev table is really complicated given that it's not required anymore. And it just strikes me that Commissioner weich has brought this up as something, as bike parking requirements is something that he's interested in. So, I mean, my sense in going through this was I think the Transportation Commission should weigh in, but I don't know if that's. Maybe at the next meeting I will just suggest that, like this is this, there may be convergence, like if he's interested in working on simplification or different standards for bike parking. Anyway, that that might be an opportunity to simplify that table. That's the one that strikes me that we haven't talked about recently, but that there might. Yeah. Okay. So for next meeting then for June, perhaps. I say no pressure if anybody has time, but like, let's not make this homework specifically. All right. Then I'm going to close that part of the agenda and move on to agenda item four, which is our second opportunity for public comment.

State your name and address for the record. If you're joining us on Zoom, you can use the raise hand feature. If you are calling in, you can press star nine. We have one hand raised caller with phone number ending in 942. You have permission to address the planning commission, the Orc ordinance revisions Committee. Hello? Hi. Hi. My name is Margaret Goodley and I live at Oakbrook condo community and I'm speaking once again to oppose the change in zoning of the 25 25 Ann Arbor Saline road parcel from office to r four e residential. I am not opposed to development of this parcel. I'm opposed to a change in zoning from office to residential development. I believe the residents would not oppose an office development that falls within the current zoning restrictions, albeit as long as the developer doesn't try to somehow add short term rentals into an office zoning. The reasons for my opposition is many, but I'll focus on three things quickly. First, due to the totality of not only existing rental units within a one to two mile radius of this location, but the already approved and proposed rental developments in this area, it is already overly saturated rental units, one being her south proposal you discussed tonight, the number of rental units among the nine existing apartments, which also include Cranbrook senior Tower, is 23 32, and the approved and proposed development is 1967 with a combined total of 4299 units. The proposed development would bring that up to 4524. And this is not enough to maintain a taxable viability of the city. Are public schools to support the public school. Secondly, I have support affordable, family friendly and working professional housing developments. None of the proposed and already approved housing developments fall into this category or fit into the goals of affordable housing of the city of Ann Arbor. The design itself is unsuitable for families with children. It has a two story clubhouse and a rooftop terrace that I guess that kids can view the daily traffic crunch entering and leaving Ann Arbor from I 94. Or they could view the football traffic during football season, which residents either leave town, find themselves trapped on Saturdays. The developer of this proposal built Sentara and it's already unaffordable. Lastly, I request that this project is rejected because of the appearance of my ward for Representative Jim are setting up and encouraging selected residents to attend meetings with the consultant and architect of this development. Thank you. Was I muted the whole time? Is there anybody else who would like to address the ordinance revisions committee? Also, to the last speaker, I did say thank you. Sorry I was muted. You can use the raise hand feature in Zoom or press star nine if you're calling in. Okay. I don't see any other participants indicating that they would like to address the commission, so I will move on to item six, which is adjournment. We did just have one more phrase. Would you entertain another speaker? Yep. Absolutely. Okay. Joy Fried R, you have permission to address the ordinance revisions committee for three minutes. Thank you. I also live in the Oakbrook condominium development, and I have concerns about that same development that Margaret had just discussed. And my concerns are, one, the whole traffic issue related to Ann Arbor Saline Road and some of the recommendations for dealing with that increased potential increased traffic was to drive through the Whole Foods parking lot. So I don't think that's really a very realistic solution. There's also additional development that's happening closer to the bushes on South Main street, etcetera, that's going to clog that area even more so that they'll be back up along Ann Arbor Saline Road. My other concern is that when you look at the proposed design of the building, it does not fit at all with any of the architectural consistency of this area. And, you know, you were discussing in the earlier presentation how not having sort of a long block of cement to walk by. Well, that's exactly what is being proposed by this developer, that it's basically a big block building without really any architectural interest. So that's another reason. And again, to reiterate, Margaret's concerns about this is not encouraging family friendly development, providing affordable housing, given that the proposed rent is about $2,300 a month per unit and the target population that the developer mentioned was retired seniors and young professionals. Again, this does not address the goals of this community that have been expressed several times over the years. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Let's wait 1 minute and see if there's anybody else who would like to speak.

That was just formally submitted the last time we met, I believe at a working session where there were a number of callers they had not yet submitted. And so we did just review internally today and decide to accept that in the formal review. And members of the public can go to stream a two gov.org comma search for that address and follow along with the files and progress of that submission. If they're curious about where it stands in the what would be the next step for that project being brought for before the commission? Or like the public, what would be the next opportunity they would have to comment on that project? It would be a public hearing at the planning commission. Okay, but, and if it is a rezoning, I'm sorry, it hasn't. That public hearing has not yet been scheduled because it's just been submitted. No, we wouldn't know the date of that until staff get into the actual process of the review and determine how well the what is submitted meets with regulations like we've been discussing tonight. So this is exactly the kind of comparison with regulation that would have to happen at a granular level across multiple departments. Fire, waste, water, solid waste, private engineering, all sorts of reviewers. Great. I would guess it's probably two months away or so from being scheduled. Okay, thank you for the update. I am not seeing anybody else raise their hand. So we'll move to adjournment. We're adjourned. Have a nice evening all. Thank you all.

I'd like to invite Jennifer hall up from our housing commission, and she will do the introductions. Good evening, mayor and city council. I would like to introduce the community leadership council. If they could stand up, please. This is a group that's been working with me on our Dunbar tower. We just had our recent groundbreaking a couple weeks ago. So if you're out there, you can see that we have geothermal bores going in. And I would like to ask David Malcolm, Shirley Beckley, and Tisha Montague to come up and just say a few words to thank city council. Good evening. My name is Tisha Montague, CLC member, and together we are a group of local residents, community leaders, and public servants dedicated to supporting the affordable housing initiatives of the city. We want to thank you for your continued support in our upcoming projects. Also, we are looking to host another amazing event in the heart of downtown Ann Arbor, the african american festival. I'm just going to briefly touch on it. The AADF promotes diverse. It brings together neighborhood into dialogue, increases creativity, offers opportunities for civic pride, and improves our general psychological well being. Not only does it support local businesses and entrepreneurs, but it stimulates the local economy as a whole. Thank you to our mayor and city council members who have attended, supported in any way. And as we celebrate our 27th annual event, Ann Arbor celebrates 200 years in a booming and blooming community of opportunities. We pay homage to those who've come before us, and we honor their legacy with a day long celebration of music, culture, amazing food, and fun for the entire family. Thank you. Good evening. My name is Shirley Beckley, and I'd like to thank the mayor, our. It's nice to meet you Mister Dahone. This is my first time meeting you. I'd like to say hello to you and to all the council members and to thank you so much for giving us the opportunity of this project for affordable housing, which has needed so much in this town at one time. I used to work for the housing commission. That's back in the seventies, that's been many years ago, but it's good to see that we're expanding and allowing to have some affordable housing. And the extra topping on the cake is that we're going to have some of the projects in what was once our local black business district and black community. And thank you again for supporting us and to continue supporting us. Thank you. Hello Mister Mayor, Mister Administrator, council persons. My name is David Malcolm, I'm a longtime resident of Ann Arbor and I appreciate you affording me the opportunity to speak with you. I appreciate you supporting and funding this project. I think it's very much needed. I promised Jennifer I was going to be good up here, and I'm going to promise you the same. But I just want to say I'm hearing a lot of ramblings about this project and how it's supposed to cause negative things within our neighborhood and I don't see that at all. I've been in this neighborhood for 52 years of my life and we used to be a village, we used to be a community. And I want to see that come back. I hear people talking about people that they don't want moving into the neighborhood and things like that. I want to pose a question to those naysayers to this project. What if, and I'm not a what if guy, but what if back in the day, you know, we put a wall up and you know, the Gremlins that came and hit the natives over the head with Plymouth Rock had that wall for them. Will we be the same America? Will we be the same Ann Arbor? No, we wouldn't. We need to make sure that we support projects like this. We support a lot of different things in this city. We need more markers to show people what we've contributed to this community. And I hope that you will continue funding these projects because they are absolutely necessary. And I appreciate you.

Thank you Miss hall et al. Thank you so much. I was thanking you all. Is that the extent of the administrator's report? Excellent, and thank you very much. We now have the pleasure of our periodic update from the downtown development Authority. Miss Thompson, you have to con. Thank you, Marcus. Good evening everybody. I know you all have a very busy meeting tonight, so I'm going to try to keep it somewhat brief. I don't see the. Marcus, I don't see it on the screen. So I wonder, perhaps I should wait. Okay, it looks like we're good to go. Thank you for your patience. So I. Hmm. Try the mouse. Oh, here we go. Perfect. I got it. Marcus. Okay, so I'm here tonight just to give you some brief updates on the parking system and the TiF system. So we'll start with the parking system in June. We will finally be implementing our rate increases. We've been talking about this for over a year. The DDA board did approve those. The slate of rate increases in April, and we will be implementing in June. We also have an operational change to our parking system coming in June. On June 2, which is the first Sunday in June, you will see gate arms down at all of our facilities. Parking patrons will have to pull a ticket to enter and insert a ticket to exit. Parking will remain free. This is best practice in the parking industry. It allows for tighter revenue controls than we have right now and also allows us to track utilization. This is something we've been talking about doing for a number of years, but we were unable to implement this until we had consistent ticketing equipment throughout our system. So we finally have that in place, and we're able to do this. We started communicating this fairly broadly beginning about mid April. You can see on the slide we have sandwich boards at all of our facilities, notified some of the nearby churches. So we did our best to get this out there. We've also been working with supportive connections to get Narcan dispensers in four of our parking facilities. I anticipate these being installed maybe this week. I mean, they're coming anytime soon. So the Maynard, Ann Ashley, Forest and Forth, and Williams structure will all have these purple dispensers. You see, supportive connections will be responsible for maintaining the inventory. Our parking operator won't be involved in that. And I also want to give an update on rooftop fencing. I know I brought this to your attention previously that we will be replacing all of the rooftop fencing on structures this year. Our engineers recently determined that we'll also be able to add a curved element to some of the fencing in some locations. So, similar to what you have or what I'm showing here on the screen, we haven't gone out to bid yet, so this isn't the actual fencing that we will be using, but it will be something similar to this. And again, we will be installing this in any location where it's feasible. And then finally, on the parking side, we just completed the first phase of an analysis of our on street accessible parking. There were recently some guidelines issued on the quantity of of on street accessible spaces that we should have. So we did an analysis of all of our blocks. The new guidelines base the count on block perimeters, which was a different way of looking at blocks from how we typically look at block faces. So we completed that analysis and we know that we need to add about 50 spaces. So the next phase of this process is actually determining the very best spaces for those 50 spots. I think many of you know, we have challenges on our downtown streets to have truly accessible spaces between the slope of the street on some blocks and then the various elements, we have curbside. So if you think about street lights, street trees, signage, street furniture, sidewalk cafes, in this photo, you see grass. So there are a lot of obstacles on our downtown streets, but we will do our very best to place those spots. And then just quickly on the Tif side, just a few updates. In March, we completed our downtown, our first round of public engagement, downtown planning workshops for our circulation study. And we collaborated with the city and they had information on the comprehensive plan. We felt like, and I think my colleagues at the city felt the same way. These were super successful sessions. We had over 350 people attend the workshops. We had well over 700 comments. We conducted 27 small group stakeholder meetings. And as you can see from the photos, we had a really wide range of ages in participating in these events. We will be doing our second round in September, so stay tuned for more information on that next round. Happy to report that our bike counters the public facing webpage is now live and up and running. We have counters on William street, division and Miller Catherine. First street has equipment that is not operational to date. We anticipate getting that up and running as soon as we can, but the figures you see in front of you or on the slide are from the first of the year.", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Downtown Development Authority", "insights": [{"observation": "We've also been working with supportive connections to get Narcan dispensers in four of our parking facilities.

We have counters on William street, division and Miller Catherine. First street has equipment that is not operational to date. We anticipate getting that up and running as soon as we can, but the figures you see in front of you or on the slide are from the first of the year. So January 1 until mid May, and we've seen close to 65,000 people using our bikeway street. So that was good news. DDA staff have been working on creating a public art and place making program. We're calling this program elevate. The goal of the program is to just enhance the downtown experience for all people and really to bring joy, more joy to our public spaces. Our board will be voting on this program in June and should it be approved, we will be implementing as soon as we can, some various projects. And then finally, I invite you all to the bicentennial bikepalooza, which takes place this Saturday from noon to two at the old Lylot, the corner of fifth and William. We will have the community high jazz band there. We'll have lots of of activities for the kids. We'll have face painting. It's all free and open to the public. And if you participate in two of our education stations, you can get one of these nifty bike opalooza t shirts. So hope to see you there. Thank you very much. Thank you. We now come to public comment general time. Public comment general time is an opportunity for members of the public to speak to council in the community about matters of municipal interest. To speak at public comment general time, one needs to have signed up in advance by contacting our city clerk. Speakers in all instances, whether home or online, will have three minutes in which to speak. So please pay close attention to the time. Our clerk or the time clock will notify you when 30 seconds are remaining and when your time is expired. When your time is expired, please conclude your remarks and seize the floor. Our first speaker today is Ken Garber. Thank you, Mayor Taylor. Ken Garber, second ward. Appreciate the opportunity. I'm with Ann Arbor for public power. Thank you for funding a phase ii feasibility study in your budget that you will be approving tonight. Last time I was here, I explained why that phase two study needs to arrive at evaluation. It also needs to avoid the errors we saw in phase two. The subcontractor Nugen badly bungled the FerC stranded cost formula. We documented all this with our expert, Chris Bisdog, in a letter we sent to staff and copied to you back in February. I'm going to go over it now, so I don't have a screen, so please forgive the whiteboard. Here's the FErC stranded cost formula. Okay, SEO is stranded cost obligation. Yeah, the Newton error started with RSE, which is revenue stream estimate. They included the distribution revenue, which is possible, but they failed to include the distribution costs, which go away with the revenue once Ann Arbor leaves the system. So sorry. Here are the errors summarized. And the second one is they didn't submit. They didn't subtract transmission revenue, which is really costs that are recovered through the rate base. They didn't consider. Ferc has a cap on stranded costs. New gen never considered that, as far as we can tell, and that there's no capacity value included in the CMVE. And finally, the worst, the most serious error is that the length of obligation is 20 years according to new Gen. Now, just backing up stranded costs are the difference between retail and wholesale revenue for the utility once Ann Arbor leaves the system based on any stranded generation that may exist. Now. Right now, FERC requires utilities to mitigate stranded costs. Right now, DTE doesn't have excess generation. It has a severe shortage because it's shutting down coal plants and it's trying to meet demand from new electrification. So the idea that we could be on the hook for 20 years of stranded generation costs is pretty absurd. It's conceivable there could be nothing. In aggregate, these errors really inflated the high end stranded cost estimate and thus the overall valuation in phase one. When we submitted this documentation to staff, we got back a letter from Rick Bunch of five links energy, who defended his study but did not contest or much less refute any of our points. Rather, he said that his stranded cost obligation was a worst case outcome. Unlikely, but possible. Well, it's possible that the earth could fall off its axis tomorrow and we could all die, but it's not a reasonable possibility. And so I think. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Jean Ross. Good evening. My name is Jeannie Ross and I'm here to ask the council to continue to support the rising hope for housing program. I live on Freeze Avenue in Ann Arbor and have been a resident for a total of 30 years. Originally moving here in 1980, I eventually moved to Florida and returned in 2020. I became engaged with a brighter way originally as a board member, and I transitioned through several roles until my current position as development director. Several other people have already explained what we do at a brighter way, so I won't go back into the details.

Several other people have already explained what we do at a brighter way, so I won't go back into the details. I would add that during the past few years we've expanded our mission and scope to include offering assistance to anyone who is just as impacted. Living in Washtenaw county, we widened our mission because we recognize that being social justice impacted continues throughout your entire life, and not just for the first three months, few months after you return home. Living in a diverse community is vitally important to me. I worry that Ann Arbor is becoming an unreachable city for most people, and I hear people talk about this wherever I go. I mean, we all know the cost of houses that are selling currently in our neighborhoods. Ann Arbor is a beautiful, small city that has so much to offer, and finding a way to welcome everyone is what makes it truly a special place, and I would really like to see us maintain that. I want to thank the council for funding the program last year. The results of it are significant. We're changing the trajectory of people's lives not just the people we see in our offices, but their families as well. And as a result, our entire community. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Kathy Griswold. Good evening. My comments are really just addressed to the public and anyone listening because I've talked to the mayor and this council many, many times and nothing. So a general comment. Fund equity. Fund equity is like a rainy day fund. It is not raining. Let's leave it there. What's really disturbing is that we are not addressing our basic safety infrastructure for our children in this budget. We're spending some of our fund equity and we are ignoring the very basic needs of our children. I'll give you a couple examples. King school crosswalks. Vegetation just keeps growing and people tell me, Kathy, you just need to go out there and cut it. That doesn't solve the problem. In Detroit, they have a two week program right now to address vegetation proactively, and they're basically giving warnings and educating the public. In Ann Arbor, we can't do that. The other one is the rectangular, rapid flashing beacons that have been requested by the community for Stone School Road. The communities asked for those over and over again, but we can't fund those now. Vision Zero is a data driven program, but we are not collecting data. Or if we are, we're keeping it a secret. Our 2023 crash data, pedestrian crash data, is not yet publicly available. The state's vision zero program states that we should do an analysis after a crash and determine if there's any contributing factors that can be improved immediately. We haven't done that back to 2020 as far as I know, so. And lastly, when our last transportation manager was hired, I had requested that we get a civil engineer with an urban planning master's degree. We did not do that. Raymond is an excellent planner. However, we do not have operational expertise in the transportation area at a high enough level in this organization to make meaningful improvements. I believe that the city of Ann Arbor is liable when crashes occur at an intersection where we have already identified the deficiencies. So if for no other reason than to protect the city of Ann Arbor, please take the appropriate action. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Jeff Hayner. Hello. I'm going to get to DC six real quick. A couple of things coming up. I don't know if folks are aware of this in Ann Arbor. I mean, many of us are, but this weekend is a movement weekend in Detroit. It's a 24th annual weekend. It's one of the largest electronic music festivals in the world. And it's pretty fantastic. It's really good for the city. A lot of people from Washtenaw county participate in Ann Arbor. I'm playing on a Sunday at old Miami and then an after party Sunday and then Monday and then after after party Thursday at Elks on the 30th. And then tomorrow there's supposedly a meeting from the group art space that's culminating what has apparently been a mostly hidden two year process to announce a location here in Ann Arbor where they're going to try and compete with the Ann Arbor Housing Commission for low income housing tax credits to give low income housing to artists. And lord knows we need more low income housing here. So I don't, I don't oppose. I'm not opposed to that idea in any way on its face. I'm just, I'm sorry to hear that. I caught the end of something that's been going on for two years now, mostly out of the public eye. Okay. DC six hundred s of rule changes that have happened in the last couple years under this body have mostly been designed to shrink or eliminate public input, give a simple majority new powers to limit council discussions, reduce public notice, reduce council's accountability to residents, and shorten meetings as much as possible because apparently you're all very busy. And there's a couple things in this batch of rules changes that are super offensive. Number one, if 30 people show up, you're going to reduce their time to two minutes each instead of three minutes.

And I got to be honest, like, we were chatting today about this and public speaking time is important to the public and go ahead and do this and treat us like three fifths of a person because that's what you're doing. You're taking away a third of what we have to say. The more important it is, the less you want to hear it. I'm sure that's fine. And the democratic party is reclaiming their opposition to free speech and public representation with a vigor unseen since the 1860s. I have to say, when they crushed the republican free press down in the south, another thing that's offensive is that now you're going to allow yourself to look at phones or electronic devices during meetings. And so now you can chat on Twitter with your rabid followers like Julie grand used to do, or you can shop for furniture like Jen Eyre used to do. I have photos if the press wants to see them, you know, two and a half years later, I still get knocks on my door from residents begging for help. That's why I wanted to have an ombuds person. I just got a letter this week from somebody. Your first act was to. To quietly hide your home addresses from the public so they still think I'm on city council. You created a situation that now you're going to pretend to solve by giving yourselves $100,000, mailing out shiny flyers touting how awesome you guys are. And the Dems in the state house abuse their franking privileges. And this is even worse. It's disgusting. Budgets reflect values, and yours are the values of sociopaths. Narcissistic sociopath. Thank you. Our next speaker is Sean Higgins. Hi, I'm Sean Higgins, the secretary of Ann Arbor for public power. I'd like to express gratitude on my behalf and on behalf of our organization to city council for setting aside part of the budget to fund a second phase feasibility study into municipalization. This type of study is essential to inform the public what to expect from municipalization and to provide a basis on which the city can argue the valuation of DTE's assets and franchise. In the case of pursuing municipalization, we feel strongly that the study must include valuations of stranded costs and going concern in order to deliver the public more precise information on cost than the wide range that came from the first study. There is precedence for this in Pueblo, Colorado's phase two study. We also feel strongly, given the deep investment in this project from ourselves and others in the community, the RFP drafting process must have public input. Our organization intends to continue our advocacy and watch the RFP and study processes closely as this is a great step forward and we want to be certain that it's done right. Again, thank you for your work, as well as your time and communication with us to bring reliable, renewable and responsible energy to this city. Thank you. Our next speaker is Michelle Hughes. Hi, this is Michelle Hughes. And I. I was looking at the proposed budget amendments, and I was really hoping to see something about unarmed response in there, and I was disappointed that I did not see it. We've, you know, a couple meetings ago, you guys passed it. Several meetings ago, you guys passed a thing saying, hey, city council is still committed to providing an unarmed response program. But the actions I haven't been seeing, that backed up by action, the city has decided to turn down the three and a half million dollars of ARPA funding that would have funded the program for a while. And there's now, nothing in the budget that I'm seeing that would fund an unarmed response program. And I really hope that if you guys don't pass an amendment to fund unarmed response this time, that you will, that you're intending to pass a budget amendment later on. And I know that you guys put out two different rfps and then nitpicked the responses until they were found unacceptable. And that's not something that people do. If they're serious and committed to creating a program, that's something that NiMBys do. If they want to not have a, you know, if they want to stop a housing from happening, they'll find some reason to knock it out. And it seemed like that's the kind of thing that was happening with the RFP, is that reasons were found to make these rfps not happen. And I hope that we can instead get something that will happen, be committed to it, because an unarmed response program is going to be very important. I'm a member of the trans community, and there's a lot of us who have mental health issues, and we can't just call the police and say, hey, my friend is suicidal. Can you do a wellness check? Because my community doesn't trust the police to 30 seconds. And there's a lot of other minority communities in town who are similarly afraid to call the police and with good reasons. There needs to be someone that's able to provide services safely and in a trustworthy manner. So we need an armed response. Thank you.

I'm a member of the trans community, and there's a lot of us who have mental health issues, and we can't just call the police and say, hey, my friend is suicidal. Can you do a wellness check? Because my community doesn't trust the police to 30 seconds. And there's a lot of other minority communities in town who are similarly afraid to call the police and with good reasons. There needs to be someone that's able to provide services safely and in a trustworthy manner. So we need an armed response. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Tom Stolberg. Good evening. This is Tom Stallberg. I'd like to talk about the budget, specifically the Fifth Amendment, which asks for $100,000 so that you council members can communicate with us, your constituents. You say that it's for equitable communications because some people don't have as much access to technology. Computers do. Email. You know, somebody could call the city and say, trying to figure out how to write to my council member or how to reach them. And the person that they'd reach on the phone at city hall could look on the website where you have your email addresses, but also your phone numbers listed. You might want to list your mailing addresses as well. I suppose if they wrote to the city, it might go in your mailbox, city hall, but you might not be checking your mailboxes. There's a lot of ways you can communicate with the constituents without spending $100,000 of tax money. And I want to know how well this has been thought through and whether you've vetted this through the city attorney's office. You know, it's one thing when you spend your personal time money putting out newsletters and communications, or especially in the campaign, when you spend your campaign funds or pack money or whatever to communicate to us, but now you're spending our money to communicate to us. What if you say something that's inaccurate? What if it's, you know, not purposefully inaccurate, but inaccurate? This is taxpayer money. You know, who vets the communications that are going out from individual council members right now I'm guessing that reports from different departments are carefully reviewed prior to them being sent out to the public. Your individual council members communications that we're going to use this hundred thousand dollars for, who's reviewing them? What's the process? I don't see that in this budget amendment. So perhaps you want to talk about that. Maybe you want to talk to your city attorney about that. What about privileged information? Citizens have asked for information and been told it's privileged. What if you accidentally communicate privileged information and then you get into the whole, I won't even go to FOIA right now. But the bottom line is it's different than a campaign where your campaign communications, even if there's inaccuracies, they're challenged in the process of campaign. They're viewed through the lens of a political campaign. This is 30 seconds from Mississippi with city money. The other thing I don't like is couching it as equitable communication. That's progressive. I'm a long time progressive. Don't hide behind things that you're going to say are equitable when this is just marketing for yourself. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Jeff Crockett. Well, I'm here to share some very exciting news. My name is Jeff Crockett and I am the head of the history subcommittee, which is coordinated with destination Ann Arbor, the library Green Conservancy, the State street district, and the Kemp House to plan Ann Arbor's 200th birthday celebration and picnic on Liberty Plaza this Saturday from 11:00 a.m. to 02:30 p.m. longtime Ann Arbor resident and radio personality Lucienne Lance is emcee.

We believe that this celebration provides us the opportunity to set aside differences and unite to celebrate the diversity that has made Ann Arbor a great place to live. Bring a picnic lunch or buy a takeout lunch from one of the nearby restaurants. We hope to see you there. And by the way, this came from Elmo's t shirts. You too can have one by going down.

Yes, hello Counsel, I'm Alan Haber. And in parallel with the Ann Arbor birthday party on the Liberty Plaza, there's an Ann Arbor birthday party on the community Commons library lane lot. And again, you are all invited. This is begin with native american recognition of where we actually are on this land and in our history. And we continue, besides having a really, really free market, not flee, but free, where people bring things of their surplus to give away and share with one another and we'll have a delicious food truck there, of course, in about five bands throughout the course of the day. The conscious cafe, which began two years ago in the co housing world. And we'll begin a conversation that actually invites you to think more deeply about what's going on in the world, the old knowledge and the new knowledge that is coming into play. And we'll have a that's a conscious cafe is getting itself established and is itself present to Ann Arbor as the Commons. Also is a presentation. We'll have a discussion on permaculture, another president too Ann Arbor, and on the local economy, toward a cooperative economy and sharing what we have in our resources. So this is a time to see how we can talk and visit and become community together. The peace table, which is traveled the world and will be on the common to help us bring our highest values to the question of how do we make peace, not through our divisions, but looking at our commonalities. So you're all invited and all you in the city who are watching and those people here. This 200th birthday, Ann Arbor, is our opening to our third century, where we look to improve what has been and have new directions of cooperation and community. So you're all invited and looking forward to a very happy Ann Arbor 200th birthday and the beginning of a very prosperous third century. Thank you all. Thank you. Our next speaker is Christine Crockett. It's a pleasure to share some very happy news with you this evening. In 1983, during the administration of Mayor Lou Belcher, the old Fourth Ward Historic district was created celebrating the oldest residential neighborhood of Ann Arbor. The following year, in 1984, we established the old Fourth Ward History Historic District Neighborhood association. And since that time, for the past 40 years, many members of the association have participated in many aspects of community life in Ann Arbor. This was recognized at the most recent conference of the Michigan Historic Preservation Network, which was in Kalamazoo. On May 10, we were awarded the community award, and this poster was at the conference to show some of the many activities we have been involved with over the years. The historical street exhibits, the downtown Neighbors Party, which, by the way, was my idea, distributing student swag under beyond the diag, that program at the University of Michigan. Lots of open meetings where we had candidates nights for many years, and everybody was welcome and they were well attended. I'd like to thank the people who helped support us in this endeavor. Our first ward councilperson, Lisa Dish, wrote an enthusiastic letter of support, as well as Ann Bannister also wrote a letter. Our former council person, state senator Jeff Irwin State representative Jason Morgan, Jill Thatcher in the planning department and also the historic district coordinator, and Christine Bremmer, the president of the Old Westside association. Our application was fine tuned by Eileen Tyler, who is here tonight, and she is a lifetime winner from the Michigan Historic Preservation Network, as is her husband, Norn Tyler, and they're both residents of the old Fourth Ward Historic District. The preservation network has been instrumental in attaining tax credits available for the restoration and reparation of the historic built environment throughout Michigan, and this year they are working on upping the level of that funding to $100 million. We've been able to take advantage of it, as have other people in Ann Arbor, to maintain our beautiful built environment. So we just want to share this happy news. We're very proud of this and we intend to continue our work in the community.

Are there communications today from council councilmember Adina I will note that in addition to some of the other celebrations that are happening this weekend for the actual 200th anniversary of our city AFC, Ann Arbor, which has the local semi pro soccer team which has partnered with the city this year for the Bicentennial, they are donating three trees for every goal they score this season. They will be doing a celebration this Saturday as well at their home game and unveiling some bicentennial swag. So I encourage folks to stop by and support our local soccer team. Further discussion further communication Council member Watson for those ward two residents that have been closely following the Nixon Road project, you'll note that I mentioned an info session in May during the last meeting talking to city staff. There's going to be a little bit of a delay in that meeting. We're looking to June or July, so I will keep residents updated on that. I'd like to thank the members of the community leadership council who are present in chambers tonight. We're all. For many of us who attended, we're all still basking in the glow of the groundbreaking ceremony last month and looking forward to the opening of Dunbar Tower. The dedication of the members of the CLC is proof positive of our community's collective investment in Dunbar Tower's success. Further communication councilmember song I'd like to echo my thanks. I'm preparing to speak at the invitation of Mishra, the state housing Authority, on our work here in Ann Arbor in addressing the housing crisis along with Detroit Mayor Duggan, the head of Mishta and a local developer in Detroit. And when I asked our housing commissioner Jennifer hall for some talking points, what she would take pride in in the work here in Ann Arbor. She pointed to the continued and constant engagement with the leadership council on I think it was twice monthly basis. I'm really proud of that work and I'm really glad that this is ongoing. So it goes past the groundbreaking. And in her email she also said that it's about repairing trusts and continuing that trust building. So I'm really excited to be able to go to Mackinac and say that this is the work that Ann Arbor has invested in and continues to invest in, and that's in partnership in recognition of history. I also want to thank folks for bringing that poster. It reminds me of the work that I saw in Martha's Vineyard and oak bluffs and seeing the historical homes there, historically black community and Martha's Vineyard, and the importance of place and community and beauty. So thank you for sharing that further communication. Councilmember Ackman thank you. On the theme of affordability, I wanted to let people know about an event tomorrow at studio studio. It's an art space meet and greet for those who are not familiar with art space. They're a very well respected group out of Minneapolis that helps with affordable and workforce housing for creatives. You know, there was an article, I think, about a week ago on m live about Ann Arbor's funky past and where it is in the present. And I think that, you know, anybody that's been here for any period of time knows that we've lost a lot of creative people to surrounding communities because it's so exciting, expensive to live here. And so Artspace is here engaging in an arts market study where they try to understand the needs of that community. In fact, Artspace is already working on the Dunbar Towers project, so they already have some engagement with the city there. Anyway, the event is tomorrow. 530 come out. There's going to be musical performances, discussion Q and a, and hope to see you there. Councilmember Harrison thank you. Last week during National Police Week, I visited Atlanta, Georgia to learn about their policing alternatives and diversion initiatives, otherwise known as PAD. Pad. In response to non emergency quality of life concerns related to mental health, substance use, or extreme poverty, police officers with probable cause to arrest can refer people to pad instead, avoiding arrests. If the individual and pad agree, the officer leaves without creating a police report. I was able to see this in practice, and I learned a lot from interacting with the dedicated team of community members, mental health professionals and police officers. This collaboration reduces unnecessary arrests and connects individuals with vital supports and resources. Speaking of National Police Week, I know that I'm often recognized as the police reform Council member and I just want to take a moment to sincerely thank our police department, led by Chief Andre Anderson, for their dedicated service and commitment to our community. I appreciate your hard work and willingness to adapt to the changes that council has implemented, namely the driving equality ordinance. So thank you. Further communication from council.

Speaking of National Police Week, I know that I'm often recognized as the police reform Council member and I just want to take a moment to sincerely thank our police department, led by Chief Andre Anderson, for their dedicated service and commitment to our community. I appreciate your hard work and willingness to adapt to the changes that council has implemented, namely the driving equality ordinance. So thank you. Further communication from council.

May have a motion, please, to approve the consent agenda moved by council member Ghazi Edwin. Seconded by councilmember Harrison. Discussion of the consent agenda, councilmember Adina. Thank you, mayor. I just wanted to call quick attention to CA eleven, which will adopt an Americans with Disabilities act transition plan for Ann Arbor Parks. This is the culmination of a couple of years of work, including an assessment of city owned recreation facilities, community centers, community wide parks, natural areas, neighborhood parks, as well as recreational programming and services. And by adopting this plan today, we will set into motion a series of immediate and long term actions to make our parks and recreation facilities, programming and spaces more accessible. Unfortunately, this work is not free, and so it does include a commitment to funding over the next 30 years and given the already limited fiscal resources within parks, staff are already working on a financing strategy for the plan that will likely include federal and state resources, philanthropic dollars, public private partnerships, and other ideas. Both the Parks Advisory Commission and Commission on Disability issues support adoption of this plan, and I just also wanted to briefly thank our committed parks staff for the work that went into developing this with our consultants and for the future work they will do alongside our city's new accessibility coordinator to implement this plan in the years to come. Thanks. Further discussion all in favor? All opposed? The consent agenda is approved.

Be one in ordinance to amend chapter 55 zoning rezoning of 0.65 acres from Twitter Township District to r1 D single family dwelling district 3701 through 3713 Riverside Drive move by councilmember Dish Second by councilmember Watson discussion please have b one councilmember Dish. I'll be brief. City staff recommended r one B for this rezoning and what we are doing here is rezoning parcels that have been recently annexed to the city. R1 requires a 10,000 square foot lot minimum and so if we rezone to that, the max that could be achieved would be three houses on this 0.74 acres. The land use plan calls for single and two family residential uses for this site, so it would not be inconsistent with a rezoning to r 1D, which is what the planning commission recommends. And what is before you to vote on. R 1D carries a 5000 square foot lot minimum and slightly, very slightly smaller front setbacks. This rezoning as we have before us, what planning commission presented r 1D is consistent with goal c of the land use element, which is to provide a full range of housing choices, size, price, design, accessibility, etcetera that meets the existing and anticipated needs of all city residents. So I will be voting yes for this as I did on planning commission, and I hope my colleagues will join me in accepting this recommendation. Further discussion all in favor? Opposed? It is approved. See one in ordinance to amend your fondest hopes realized c one an ordinance to amend section 460 and 461 of chapter 49 sidewalks of title four streets and sidewalks of the Code of the City of Ann Arbor, moved by councilmember Cornell seconded by councilmember Briggs. Discussion Please, of c one council member COrnell thank you. I want to thank the residents who reached out after our snow events this winter and pointed out areas of opportunity to improve our accessibility within the city and to do a better job collectively as a community with our snow removal. So what this ordinance change involves are a couple of things. One of the things I think that was surprising to me was to find out that citizens private homeowners paid the same amount of fees as commercial entities or apartment buildings when snow removal was not done according to our current ordinance. So this change modifies that and commercial multifamily dwellings would have more additional fines than what homeowners individual property owners would have. So hopefully, I know we heard a lot about half blocks long of property downtown that snow was not removed from and that that was obviously a really significant barrier for those who walk or bike or have mobility issues. So that closes is that preferential treatment, so to speak? And the other big change in this is that it adds an email option to deliver a citation. So currently a citation is delivered by mail. The person who owns the property might not be local, it takes several days for it to get there, and by that point, the snow is hopefully either melted or gone anyway. So this allows for expanded notification options either by phone or by email, as well as snail mail to Woohoo, who is the owner's agent listed on the property. So these two things for us in talking with community standards and with the legal office, really help to make our snow removal compelling and also motivating for people to actually do it. But I think levels the playing field in some ways where there are some pretty significant disparities. Councilman Rodina, thank you. I just actually have a quick question with regard to the fee or the fine ranges in the ordinance. And so I appreciate the change to differentiate between kind of the bigger complexes and single residents, but I wonder if the city attorney could explain how citations are generally issued when there's a range of possible fines for an offense. So like the $60 to $100 or $250 to $500. And I'm particularly concerned here about how to ensure that we don't have bias or inequity in our citation process. Thank you. Go ahead, John. My apologies, Mister Riser, Mister Reiser. All good. You're on. Okay, thanks. Sorry, I don't want to jump on my boss, but currently it's just the ticket, obviously, and it's a ticket based on whether it's a first offense or whether it's a second offense. Under the proposed ordinance, it would be a ticket for one kind of zoning district, which would be r one, two, or three, which are single family duplex or townhouse or something other than that, either commercial or, or four reals, which is like apartment buildings, apartment complexes. So the bias would be if you've got more property, if you're a commercial district, you're going to get a bigger ticket. So that's done based on those are in commercial districts and there's, you know, more sidewal", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Ann Arbor", "insights": [{"observation": "Ordinance to amend chapter 55 zoning rezoning of 0.65 acres from Township district to R1D single family dwelling District, 3701-3713 Riverside Drive.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The land use plan calls for single and two family residential uses for this site, so it would not be inconsistent with a rezoning to r 1D, which is what the planning commission recommends.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "R 1D carries a 5000 square foot lot minimum and slightly smaller front setbacks.

So that's done based on those are in commercial districts and there's, you know, more sidewalk to a plow, they get more use. And so that's, that's what differentiates the two. Currently, of course, council could actually. Sorry, sorry. I think I'm going to. I'm going to. I think I. You may have misunderstood or I may not have phrased correctly, within those individual. So for example, for an r1.02 reals and three reals, even within that, for the first offense, there's a range of a fine of 60 up to $100. 2nd offense is 100, up to dollar 253rd is dollar 200 to dollar 400. And so I guess I'm wondering, within those offenses, how we're ensuring that one person isn't getting a $60 offense or certain neighborhoods are getting a $60 offense while others are getting $100 offense. And currently the only way to know that would be to ask the court administrator to see what the fines have been. If a ticket is issued and it's not set for a formal hearing, then it'll go before the magistrate and then someone can accept responsibility. Responsibility, or accept responsibility, either outright or with an explanation. And then the magistrate listens to the plight the story and then imposes a fee accordingly. Even though it's $60. Some of those have been as low as $10. And the drafters of this motion wanted there to be some minimum accountability, even in residential districts, for not shoveling snow. So they set a minimum of dollar 60. It will be up to the magistrate if it's an informal hearing and if it's set for a former hearing, that would go in front of the judge. When I adjudicate infractions in the 15th district court, it's often if someone accepts responsibility, we haven't plead to the lowest just because they're cooperating and, you know, we're trying to enforce through education, and there's no reason to ask for a higher fine structure than you, than you really need to. That's what the second offense provisions are for with a mandatory minimum of in a residential $100. So I don't know if that answers your question. It's up to the discretion of the judge or magistrate who imposes the sentence for informal hearing. Thank you, Councilor Ghazi. Edwin. Thank you, Mayor. So I, you know, I'm one of the co sponsors on this, on this ordinance change, and I think that it's, it's necessary for various accessibility reasons. This was something that was reviewed by members of CoDi because there are currently, obviously, a lot of accessibility issues with inadequate snow shoveling. I also want to make sure that in the enforcement of this, that we are thinking about unintended consequences, and we need to make sure that people who are unable to shovel due to disability or maybe there's economic or social hardship that they get connected with the resources that they need. So, you know, one of the things that I'm trying to do right now is also help the city explore how to increase capacity for snow match so that it can become more robust. But in addition, in this ordinance, I would like to make an amendment that would ensure that individuals would be connected to resources if they need them. Should I just go ahead and read it. Forward it to clerk. Okay, I believe that's already been forwarded to the clerk. Can you send that back around, please? Is that my notice? Sounds like it got through. Okay. Okay. So the amendment would be adding a paragraph under section 461 one. It would be a separate paragraph inserted, which would make it paragraph two. And the additional text would read. The notice shall contain information directing residents with disability or other access needs to contact community standards for potential assistance, including from programs that pair residents with volunteers to assist them with snow removal. Is there a second 2nd by Councilmember Adina? Councilor Grasiadwin, you still have the floor. Thank you. I think that, you know, any, any point of contact that we have with residents, whether it's a warning, that's another thing that should be pointed out about this. It's not just giving out fines. There is a warning that goes out. And in that warning, it will be explicit that if you have an access issue, if there's social, economic hardship, you can call this number and we will help. So I hope my colleagues will support this tonight as well. Is that amendment friendly to the body? The amendment is friendly. Council member gazed, you still have the floor, should you wish. Well, I just. I also want to thank, you know, council members Cornell and Briggs and Ackman for all your hard work on this. I do have a question for attorney Reiser. Would it be possible to utilize funds from the fines that are generated from this to potentially fund some of the assistive services that we provide, like snowmatch or potentially expanding snow match? I guess that would be. Oh, go ahead. Sorry, I don't know if that's for me. Or maybe it would be Mister Dohoney. Is that wrong? Right. It should be the attorney rising attorney riser.

If you know how to answer that question and what the court does with the funds, go ahead. I'm willing to step up an answer, but I don't want to step on toes either. The fines in court costs for municipal civil infractions go back to the political subdivision whose ordinance was violated. And I called the court administrator and, you know, she sends them to the city. To the city. Of course, it's a policy question for this board and for the administrator as to how to dole out those funds. We can keep track of how many violations of this would be a violation of section four, colon 60, which is removal of snow and ice from sidewalks, walks and ramps. So we know how many that there were. There were 77 of them, for instance, for this year. To find out how much revenue it created. You'd have to look at each case individually, because if there's a ticket issue, if it were up to $60, some of them are ten, some of them might be 2030, 40, 60, or whatever. So you'd have to kind of track how much revenue was produced. Also, if someone got a ticket, but they didn't show up for court, then a default judgment would be entered, and there wouldn't be any revenue collected from that default judgment. So it would be. The answer is yes to your question, but tracking how much it is will be a trickier problem that would involve, you know, court administration kind of seeing. Following up on the violations for 460. Okay, thank you. Is there a way we can get those numbers from council? Oh, am I done with my time? You're done with your time. Okay. All right, next time. Thank you so much, council member Ackman. Councilmember Ackman. Thank you. So, as councilmember Cornell said in her comments, our intent was to scale the fees to the type of property. And I heard from a resident who pointed out that the way that the ordinance is written in our version, there is housing of the type that we intend to find less in some of these zoning categories. So, for example, this person lives in a detached home in zoned office. So our intent was not to treat that as office. And so I'd like to introduce an amendment that I think was already sent around. That the fines for a single family dwelling, two family dwelling, or townhouse dwelling unit located on a non residential zone parcel. Shall be treated the same as our one residential property. Is there a second 2nd by Councilmer Cornell? Is that friendly to the body? Thank you. It's friendly. Councillor Ackman, you still have the floor. I don't have anything to add, except thanks for the resident that reached out to point out this unintended consequence. Thanks. Further discussion. All in favor? Councilmember Adina? I was just gonna say, I am gonna support moving this to a second reading tonight. But I think I'd like to have maybe some further conversations between now and then to just better understand what other ordinances we have that allow kind of discretion in the fine schedule. I am just a little concerned about how that might impact residents if there's discretion being granted and how it could be applied inequitably if it's outside of our hands. So. Thanks. Thank you, Councilor Agman. Sure. I'm going to take a stab and ask attorney Reiser a question. I think it's the case that these fines are always discretionary and what counsel is doing is setting up a bottom and an upper limit. That's absolutely correct. If it's a fine of up to dollar 200, it could be, or up to dollar 500, it could be dollar 100, it could be dollar 60, it could be anywhere in between. And that's sometimes a function of what's resolved during the course of a docket, during the course of a plea based on cooperation, not knowing the equities, et cetera. And I appreciate council member Rodeana's concern that it'd be fair and looked at from, you know, equity lens. Is it fair? Why do some get a break, others not get a break? So the way to avoid that is to put potentially mandatory minimum fees, which make it somewhat fair and have a maximum so at least someone gets the amount.

Signed by Councillor Song. Discussion please, of DS one. Council member Dish. Thank you, Mister Mayor. I'm really happy to see this. With this resolution, the city steps up as one of the financial stakeholders in this important project. Bonding the affordable housing millage money makes it possible for for Ann Arbor Housing Commission to pursue several projects concurrently at different stages in the process and the processes of assembling funding and developing site plan and various approvals take so long that it is crucial to be able to have several irons in the fire at once. So I am happy to do this. Further discussion. Councillor Roussell, I am beyond thrilled. I think a constant refrain has been let's talk about cdfis, let's talk about bonding, let's talk about housing and financing and how difficult it is to get. Was it twelve pots of funding for the East Catherine project? And now we're one of those pots. So it shows, I think, confidence in our own work and leadership in the housing commission and true partnerships. So thanks to the city administrator's office and to our CFO for this extra work. And because it is work, it's not just trust and confidence, it's actually staff time. So I appreciate it. Thank you. Further discussion. For my part, I'm very excited too, about this moving forward. You know, what we are able to do here is we are able to leverage the great and good work done by staff, by community members, by council, past and present in moving forward on our affordable housing initiatives. And further, what we are doing is we are augmenting and leveraging the commitment made by Ann Arbor's voters in 2020 to support the affordable housing millage. By that millage, of course, we have levied a property tax of one mil on ourselves over the course of the next 16 years in order to support affordable housing ever since, since 2020, ever since 2020. What we're doing here with this bond, and the bond on the next, is that we are accelerating that funding, the utilization of that funding through the market in order to provide housing today for Ann Arbor residents, for future, perhaps present Ann Arbor residents, but certainly future Ann Arbor residents who will be here, who will be in need and will be here shortly. It is, I think, a exciting use of our affordable housing millage. It is a strategy with great promise and I look forward to it being affected in other contexts as well. Further discussion.

It's a compilation of a lot of different amendments that are being proposed tonight. Some that have been drawn from staff, some from legal staff, some from council members, from the public. And, you know, there's a number of, a number of ones that just improve clarity and bring them up to kind of up to date in terms of how communications happen. But a few of the notable changes that I wanted to just draw attention to for us, for council members, there's a change that we would not add an item to the agenda after 05:00 p.m. on Thursday, except for in the situation where we might vote to amend the agenda here at the table. A change that public commenter to the public commenter zone, that we would essentially identify an area around the speaking podium that others couldn't encroach upon. When you're there to speak, because it's your time, unless you've invited somebody in there to speak with you. There's a change that signage wouldn't be able to be affixed to the council chambers or obstruct the aisles. Another notable change is that an ordinance wouldn't be, couldn't be introduced. An ordinance change wouldn't be introduced by a council member without first giving the city administrator the opportunity to provide feedback to us about what the budgetary impacts of that might be, and that would happen within a 30 day time period. And then there's also a change, as one public commenter noted, to public speaking time. So when there would be a large group of members coming to speak in front of to council. If there were more than 30 members, instead of having the usual three minutes, there would be two minutes. Contrary to the framing in which it was presented earlier, what that does is actually provide more opportunity for folks to be able to speak at the beginning. So now we would have 15 members of the public that could speak at the beginning, and then the remainder overflow would happen at the end of the meeting. This would move that up so that 22 or 23 members of the public could speak to us in advance of our consideration. So I will. Those are some of the notable changes. Maybe others have noted other ones and want to speak to them. Councilmember Eyre, I think councilmember Briggs pretty adequately summarized all of the changes, at least the most notable ones. But I did want to underscore a couple of things. One, the prohibition, I guess, on adding items to the agenda is something that I think is a really good move. I think for a long time, you know, things get added because they get worked on up into the deadline. I don't know about others. I'm a deadline addict. I guess I'll just say just making that deadline earlier, I think, will just force us to get the work done in a more timely manner. And that's important because the sooner that those items are on the agenda, the sooner the public can see them and can react to them and have some time to give us feedback before the meeting so that we can really consider more public input before voting. So that is important. Again, the public speaking time is also important because we do have that time limit at the beginning of meetings, that 45 minutes time limit. And, you know, we do want to make sure that we hear from as many people as possible and not have to have as many flowing over into the overflow. You know, this is how the public schools, AAPs does their speaking time. They divvy it up based on the number of speakers. We're not quite going that far, but just trying to give more people an opportunity to speak before, again, before we vote. That's the important thing is hearing from the public before we're voting on items. So thank you, Councillor Ackman. I just wanted to say that I appreciate the changes to the sign rules because I think that this is responsive to a lot of community concerns that we've had from other speakers that come here and people watching on television when there's certain people encroaching very deliberately with their signs into the other person's speaking space. So just giving everybody their time to speak without being kind of interrupted by signs or otherwise. So thank you. Further discussion. Council member Dish. I'll pose this as a question. Do I still have to do this now that the things are in the ceiling? You do. Okay. Thank you. So that made it sound like I'm hallucinating some men, but no, I just wanted to. I'll pose as a question, something that I know the answer to. But everyone who comes, who signs up in advance and wants to speak, whether it is virtually or in person, will still get the chance to speak under these new rules. And so I really appreciate the emphasis that you've put on saying that we will be able to hear from more people at the beginning of the meeting before we vote, because that comment time remains 45 minutes, but overflow time will accommodate everyone who has signed up to speak. Question mark? Yes. Councilor Cornell? Oh, Casper Rodina. Sorry. Thanks. Since we're all taking a second crack at this one, I will also say one of the things that I'm excited about is that we are also now including some additional time to ensure that all of the ordinances and resolutions that come before us have the opportunity to have a fiscal impact statement added to them, so that we also, particularly as we're working on th", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Local Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Changes including adding items to the agenda earlier and ensuring fiscal impact statements are added to ordinances.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Change related to public commenters' zone to prevent encroachment and ensure clear speaking space.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Adjusting public speaking time to allow more people to speak before official voting.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Responsive changes to sign rules to avoid interruptions by signage.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Local Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Changes including adding items to the agenda earlier and ensuring fiscal impact statements are added to ordinances.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Change related to public commenters' zone to prevent encroachment and ensure clear speaking space.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Adjusting public speaking time to allow more people to speak before official voting.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Responsive changes to sign rules to avoid interruptions by signage.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 4630510, "chunk_end_time": 5049284, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEAiGd1wvuM", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEAiGd1wvuM&t=4630s"}, {"start": 69000, "end": 75000, "text": "sound like I'm hallucinating some men, but no, I just wanted to.

And so this requires some additional time be added for the city administrator to review for ordinances. It grants him the option to add that statement to residents resolutions, and that's something that I'm particularly excited about with this change and continue. Will continue to monitor, because I would like to make sure that even with our resolutions, we're making sure that we're continuing to have that fiscal outlook as well.

There's a staff introduction and for one of the amendments, correct? Okay. Hi, this is Nick Hutchinson, city engineer. Mister Hutchinson, my apologies. If this relates specifically to an amendment, then perhaps let's wait until that. Until. And if that amendment is introduced, and then we'll roll with you. Otherwise, very well. Thank you. Excellent. Although it's been a pleasure to see you. If, but briefly, has this been moved and seconded? Yes, it has. Discussion, Councilmember Dish. I would like to move amendment one to DS five. Is there a second? Seconded by Councilor Cornell. Councillor Dish. Councilor, thank you. I want to remind the council that on April 1, we passed a suite of economic development reforms in pursuit of crucial city goals. Knowing that many of them would require action by the city planning commission and planning staff, and knowing that the planning department and the city planning commission are already stretched beyond capacity by their regular workflow, plus the comprehensive of land use plan update, council would receive funding requests from community services to execute our economic development directives later this summer and into the fall. The one time funds provided by this amendment merely get ahead of those requests by providing funds tonight for work that we've asked them to do in pursuit of goals that council has affirmed as high priorities. It is organizationally responsible to provide funding for high priority objectives, and it's also fiscally responsible because passing this amendment, even if we pass this amendment, we remain within policy guidance regarding the fund balance. So I hope you will join me in voting yes for this amendment. Further discussion of amendment number one. Councilmember Cornell. I want to thank councilmember Dish for working on what is not probably the sexiest amendment ever to a budget. But the thing that I think is really exciting about this is that we are acknowledging to staff that we are asking them to move quickly on some of these budget priorities which have already been voted on, and recognizing that our current staff is doing the work that they're currently doing, and therefore picking up some of this additional work that the community is asking of them does require funding. And I think it's really interesting that we talked about there being a budget impact statement attached to certain resolutions and whatnot going forward. And I think that this is just kind of, in a way, it's kind of jumping the shark to impose this on ourselves right now as acknowledgement that our current budget doesn't meet exactly what we're asking of staff. So I'm excited to provide resources for this work. Further discussion. Councilmember Briggs?

So I'm excited to provide resources for this work. Further discussion. Councilmember Briggs? Yeah, I appreciate, certainly the spirit of where this is coming from. I did want to just note that I think we have to be super careful with each amendment that we're thinking about, as you noted, sort of the impact on what our general fund reserve is going to be. I want to make it clear, I asked Miss Prashan earlier today what the impact would be. It's going to bring us to a 15.45% fund balance from a 15.6%. And so we are drawing ourselves down. 15% is the lowest that. We do not want to go under that. And I think we do want to recognize that there are, you know, there may be other things that are coming up throughout the year that we might need to do budget amendments for. So just be cognizant of that as we're doing this. I think what's drawing me into thinking that this is something we need to support right now is obviously, this has been a recommendation from staff to pursue the economic, from the economic development report. We've prioritized this as ourselves as a council this spring, and we recognize that our planning staff just simply doesn't have the capacity to be able to do this without professional services report and so professional, you know, external help on this. So I think in this case, I'm willing to support that. But I think we should be very cognizant of, of these asks further discussion. For my part, I'm excited about moving forward with this amendment. So many. We, of course, have great ambitions with respect to improving our city, to expanding housing availability, to making transportation and our transportation network, which runs and follows our built network, and making that more accessible and for all users up and down the line in an expanding housing density and housing supply, as well as other zoning related changes. We do not have the ability to do that at the pace that I think this council and the public desires. Passing this amendment will move us in that direction, and I'm excited by this prospect. Further discussion. All in favor? All opposed? It is approved. Question, sir? Mister Mayor. Oh, yes, Mister Donney, I'm not clear on the process for approving the budget. Are we. Are we voting on the amendments and you then going to incorporate all of that into the budget? Or are we assuming that the budget's already passed and you're just. The budget has not yet. These amendments are incorporated into the budget. The budget. The budget has not yet been. The budget has been moved and seconded. It has not yet been passed. These are amendments proposed to the budget. When they run their course up and down. The budget will have been modified by the amendments that have been approved. Okay, further discussion of the budget as amended. Councilmember Dish, I would like to move amendment two to ds five. Is there a second? 2nd by Councilmember Cornell? Council member Dish, you still have the floor. Okay. I'd like to remind everyone that this past spring, two experienced level five staff members retired from the planning department. The city administrator's proposed budget provides for a revenue neutral replacement of these positions by three new ftes at level one. Despite that the budget adds an Fte for planning. This replacement is revenue neutral because of the significant pension and health benefits savings that happen when experienced staff members retire. So two of these new positions have been hired, and the people are great and they are rapidly training into their new jobs. This amendment proposes to upgrade the third of these new positions to level five to better position planning staff to design and implement the many transformative ideas that I'm sure will come out of the comprehensive land use plan process. Upgrading this position will increase planning revenues in an amount equal to the cost of the upgrade. So I hope you will join me in supporting it. Further discussion. So much of our work that we look to accomplish here at the council table and in our queries and exhortations from members of the public rolls through planning commission and the planning department. And so I'm excited about this opportunity. I'm glad that we're having additional capacity in terms of the new ftes, but also glad about the prospect of having one of those ftes having, I won't say gray hairs for in connection with reverse age discrimination, perhaps, but I will say with the requisite experience necessary to satisfy the requirements to be a level five planner.

Further discussion. All in favor? All opposed? Amendment two is approved. Further discussion of the budget as amended. Councilmeric Cornell, I would like to move amendment three to the table for consideration. Is there a second 2nd by Councilmember Ackman. Discussion, please. Oh, Councilmember Cornell, you still have the floor. Yeah. Thank you. I want to thank my colleagues who worked on this councilmember Briggs, Ghazi, Edwin Watson, and Ackman. This renews funding that was allocated to the budget last year from the marijuana excise tax rebate to fund eviction prevention and low income youth services. I know that my colleagues have many things to say about this. I will be very brief in my remarks. Jennifer hall, on request, sent information specific about the eviction prevention program and the impact that this funding had last year, and it was really compelling to me. Overall, there were 352 requests, 299 were approved. When you look at the data, the folks who were helped most by this were overwhelmingly helped by this, were our disabled neighbors, women, and people of color. And what really struck me was that 63% of the recipients of the service had children. And so we're talking about families in our communities and keeping them in their homes. And I can't think of a better use for this type of funding and an expression of our values in the community. Further discussion councilmember Briggs. Yeah, I'm happy to support this tonight. I think, you know, this is a biennial budget, and I'm glad to be able to carry forward these budgetary requests into year two. I think we've heard about the power of the eviction prevention fund in terms of what those impacts are. We know the shortage of affordable housing that we have, being able to keep people in their homes rather than trying to find them new homes in our affordable housing sites is a really impactful, it's very helpful. We know that the county has provided additional funds for eviction prevention. And so I'm hopeful that next year there may be, chances are there will never be sufficient funds to be able to address this need, but there will be more funding for this. The county has not yet determined how they're going to be sort of distributing these funds. And so I think is my understanding. And so I think those policies are still being set with regards to the low income youth services. We've seen the report from Jennifer hall. We've also received communications in our email about how impactful those, those funds have been. This was something that I advocated pretty strongly for in last years budget, because when I knocked doors following a shooting in the Fifth Ward and asked folks what they wanted to see, what they asked for was more, not that it was directly related to the shooting, but they asked for more programming for youth services. They saw that as a real, a real need in the community. And so I say this is a real delivery on that. I would like for folks to know who, for the nonprofits that are, they're seeing increased, you know, seeing their funding return this year, this is not a stable source of funding. I encourage those nonprofits to make sure that they're looking ahead, looking at, not necessarily counting it in their budgets next year. We don't know if they is a reoccurring source of funding. We can look at our own fiscal outlook and understand that we may need to tighten our own belt the next couple of years. And so I strongly support this funding, but I supporting it for this year. Councilor Ryer. Yeah, I'm just fully in support of this and would like to be added as a co sponsor, please. Councillor Gazian. Thank you. You know, I appreciate both the work from the Ann Arbor Housing Commission and both of helping to manage both of these pots of funding, both for eviction prevention and for youth programming. And I'll be brief, but I just want to call out some of the work of an organization in my own word, in my own ward community action network. And they expressed to me that the funding from this grant helped them to create a mental health behavioral program for youth and higher behavioral health director. And in addition, you know, during this time, when we know our schools are so strapped for resources, this funding also helps Scarlett and Tappan middle schools to launch an evidence based program called Check and Connect Mentoring Program, which allows AAPs to extend support for youth behavioral health support beyond the school day. So it's important, and I'm really proud of us, that we are continuing this effort. And thank you to the community orgs that make it happen. Councilmember Watson, I was proud to bring forward a similar amendment last year, and I'm glad to co sponsor again this year. This amendment allocates the 250,000 to eviction prevention because the best way to keep people housed is to catch them before they fall into homelessness. Sometimes only $1,000 is enough to help a family make their rent payments and keep their housing as their income stabilizes, avoiding the legally fraught and costly eviction process. At a time where there are few available shelter beds and few permanent supportive housing units, it is important to help community members stay housed. Remarkable thing about this funding is how quickly it goes out the door. Between March 7 and September 15, 15th of 2023, we were able to help 299 households, as my colleagues mentioned.

The other portion of this amendment dedicates 250,000 to youth services. We know that our low income and minority youth have been impacted both by the current economic conditions and the residual effects of the pandemic. Pandemic. I was talking to a leader of one of the programs that Avalon helped fund this past year, CLR and the community leadership academy. And they told me that they were able to take a program that had been running Saturdays in the summer and start to run that Saturdays year round. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment that is once again bolstering use services on our housing commission sites and throughout the community. Councilor song, last week, so's community services held a breakfast convening on the state of homelessness in the county. State of homelessness and hunger, and reflected on the resources available to them and how limited they are. What the city can contribute can be leveraged several times over. So, for example, right now, so's is trying to raise a total of 200,000 in order to attain a four to one match from HUD. They're at 94,000 currently. So when you think about what we're dedicating here and how what they're saying is that $15 to end homelessness for one day for a child can be leveraged times four. So I'll give you an example what I want. Let me just say that. How to have every single council member here be in touch with a social service agency director and know the community, know the homelessness count, know the can name not only a shelter, but food pantries in your own wards. That's progress. So thank you for having those conversations. So if I can only just share quickly just a story that so's had put out with the family that they're working on. They have a family that's been homeless and on the shelter waitlist for a year. They live in their car, they spend their days at the library, they deliver meals for doordash, but it's not enough. So this funding can make some real impacts in our community where we're facing, I think, up to a 10% increase in rents and have about 100 families living on the streets a night in our parking garages in our county. So it's not just Ann Arbor, it's in our county. So the work here, it's our dollars at work here. The impact goes throughout the county. If I can, I'd like to be added to the amendment as a sponsor. Thanks, councilmember Adina. Thank you. I also am just incredibly supportive. Want to thank the sponsors who worked on this and would like to be added as a co sponsor. Please. Councilmember Dish. I also am so pleased to see this and would like to be added as a cosponsor for the councilmember Harrison. I just want to say I'm thankful for the work that was done on this, and I would also like to be added as a co sponsor. Further discussion. All in favor? All opposed? It is approved.

Discussion council member Harrison, you still have the floor. All right. The rising hope for housing program is transforming lives by offering essential trauma informed services like mental health counseling, housing advocacy and job training. These services empower those impacted by the criminal legal system, help lower recidivism rates, and increase public health. Public safety for those impacted by the criminal legal system, housing is the foundation of a stable life. Uninterrupted safe housing dramatically reduces trauma and recidivism, enabling returning citizens to rebuild their lives with dignity and purpose. This year, I am or we are requesting an additional $100,000 for the marijuana from the marijuana excise tax revenue, bringing our total to $500,000 for this program. As demand grows, so must our support. The jail voucher program aiding those returning citizens fighting homelessness and recidivism is set to expand. We must meet this need head on. Last year, we took a stand against the war on drugs and justices by redirecting marijuana tax revenue to support those impacted by the criminal legal system. This was restorative justice in action. Community support is the lifeblood of these programs. We've heard the powerful voices are of returning citizens and dedicated organizations. They've told us that sustainable funding is essential for continuous, effective support. Securing this funding will help us uphold our commitment to building a strong and inclusive community and continue to make meaningful and lasting impacts. A yes vote today sends a clear message. We believe in our returning citizens. We recognize their potential and the crucial role of community backing. We've listened to their stories and to the organizations working tirelessly for their success.

For many, the initial focus was housing, but they can continue to utilize services for needs in other areas. This underscores the importance of multiple services and agencies working together collaboratively. Because we can't rely solely on fluctuating marijuana excise tax revenues. I am also requesting that our city administrator examine options of securing permanent funding sources for the rising hope for housing program. But I am also asking the collaboration of community organizations to look for funding sources since this is not a stable funding source. This resolution allows us to leverage marijuana excise tax revenues to make a positive impact, creating a safer, healthier, and more prosperous Ann Arbor and community. And I hope you all will join me in supporting it for the discussion. Councilmember Redina thank you, mayor. I don't think I can say it better than Councilmember Harrison just did, but the importance and the, the impact that this program has, I think we've been hearing also from members of the community who have been directly impacted by this program over the last several meetings. And I just want to reiterate my thanks and gratitude to them for their courage in coming forward and continuing to speak out on behalf of themselves and the impact that this had in helping them to reintegrate into the community. And so I'm just really grateful for Councilmember Harrison's leadership in this area and for continuing to be a champion of this program. And I also encourage my colleagues support. I think it's an incredible program. We should keep funding. Thanks. Further discussion. Councilmember Briggs yeah, I would, I'd like to be added as a co sponsor. This is a great program. We've heard testament of so many folks who've come before us and spoken how powerfully this has impacted their lives, the lives of those that they're serving through their work. And so I think it's, I'm glad that we've been able to do this in these last two budgets. I appreciate, Councilmember Harrison, that, you know, are looking to see if there's a recurring opportunity for us to be able to support this or work with, I would assume potentially, our partners at the county to figure out how their stable sources of funding might be able to be secured through that. I am going to sound like a broken record tonight. I'm just going to. Our fiscal outlook in fiscal year 2029 shows a recurring budget deficit of five. I shouldn't even think that I can remember numbers for more than a second, 5.9 million by fiscal year 2029. And so I know that there are, if those concern, you know, we have a concern, conservative forecast to make sure that we are, you know, being aware of that. Hopefully, we don't see that and that our economic development work is bringing in the revenue that we want to see so that we get to be able to continue to support really important programs like this in our community. Further discussion. Councilmember Gazier and then Watson, I also just want to thank councilmember Harrison for your dedicated work on this. And it's been really astounding to see the community to this program. And just the personal testimonies have been so moving. And I think that in a city like Ann Arbor, where we know that the affordability crisis is, like, exponentially rising, and we have the highest recidivism rate of all counties in the state, this is exactly where a program like this should be. So I'd like to be edited as a co sponsor. Thank you, council member Watson. I'd like to be added as a co sponsor, but I also just wanted to highlight the fact that this amendment has, and this program has brought together a diverse set of nonprofits with the city's own contribution of supportive connections. So it's not only leveraging groups that are working together that perhaps hadn't been working together in the same way before, but it's also adding our city staffers in support of connections. And I've had judges in courtrooms here in Ann Arbor talk about the fact that this is really aiding people sometimes even as they leave the courtroom. I can't say that any better than the community members who've presented their testimonials before council, but I'm grateful that the city is supporting this. And if you look at the documentation, this is really in sort of the ramp up phase, and we're seeing growth every month in the number of families served. Thank you. Further discussion. I, too, am excited that we are moving forward with this program. It is obviously a crucial need in our community, and it is a need that we are able to satisfy through this important effort. Grateful for the work done by the initial drafters, I'm asked to be added as a co sponsor, and I am looking forward to how we can permanentize programs such as this initiative, such as this.

Bye, Councilmember Dish. Council member Iyer, you still have the floor. Thank you. So this amendment is to appropriate $100,000 from the general fund budget to equitable communications to the community. This is an idea that I've been thinking about, really, over the past three years that I've been serving based on various conversations I've had with constituents. But it really was, the need for it was really solidified to me in one particular interaction with a constituent, an elderly woman in my wardrobe who had a really, really hard time figuring out who her council reps were, and tough time navigating the website when she finally was able to find it. And, you know, it just. And she and I spent a good 45 minutes on the phone talking about how much money the city spends on the website and the digital communications and all the ways that we reach out to residents who have the ability to use those forms and how very precious little we do for folks like her. And so, really, this is a drop in the bucket when we think about everything we spend on communicating to the public digitally. But the idea here is that each council member would be able to, once a year, send out a, you know, small mailer to every household in their ward. This is informational in nature, so just letting them know who their council member is, should they need them, and giving some information on city services that they may want to avail themselves of. City resources. The things, the kinds of things that we've been talking about here tonight, eviction protection or prevention and things like that. And, you know, a small bit of news about new initiatives in the city. So if this passes, the next step would be that the admin committee would put together some parameters for what could be included, what couldn't be included? The process by which things are vetted. City attorney making sure that we're not putting out incorrect information and that we are hewing to the, you know, the parameters and really the spirit of what this is, which is one point of contact once a year that we know people will get in their mailboxes that they can tuck away and have on hand, should they need to have someone assist them with interacting with the city in the future. Council. Edwin, thank you. So, you know, I've added my name to this because I think it's completely appropriate that part of our communications budget be allocated for us to present information in different formats. That's a disability best practice. There have been studies that show if you keep everything online, if everything is digital, there's a significant segment of the population who often need the resources and services the most, who never get to hear about them. This is not, as you know, we were led to believe prior, during public comment. It's going to be campaign information. It's not going to be personal kind of opinions of council members. This is going to be objective. Who is your council member? What are services available to you? I hope they will also be brailled. I hope to talk to communications about that. And, yeah, everything should not be available online if we want everyone to have equal access to information. So I hope others will join us in supporting this council. British. Yeah. I just want to underscore that this is not funding for council members to send out newsletters. Those are. That would be, I mean, first of all, you wouldn't have a newsletter that went out once a year, or I really hope it doesn't get to be that slow in my case. And those do provide analysis and they really do shift into campaign mode, I think newsletters, even as informative as they are, and it just would be completely inappropriate. So we want to make clear that that's not what this is about, and it is to serve residents. One of the residents in my ward has had trouble intersecting with one of our energy efficiency programs because she does not have access to Internet. And I canvassed her and then came back and followed up with her, and then she called me and said, I'm still having trouble. And so I followed up with her again, and it's great that she happened to be home the day that I canvassed her, but otherwise, you know, she's not effectively served and she doesn't have the information she needs. Councilmember Briggs, thanks. I appreciate the intent with which this is brought forward. I think we can all agree that there is a digital divide, that there's need for communication to residents in a wide variety of different mechanisms to make sure that we reach people where they're at. We've seen a report around public engagement, and there's, you know, certainly reaching people at their homes is the best way to go. I would say that I think that it's appropriate that we take a little bit more time to identify the details of this before we appropriate funding for it.

I would say that I think that it's appropriate that we take a little bit more time to identify the details of this before we appropriate funding for it. We're not talking about communications from the city directly, written communications. We're talking about communications from city council members. And there are obviously a lot of parameters that we'll need to be following. If we, you know, if communications are coming from a council member, just, you know, even talking about what future communications could be, there certainly could be a political component of that. And I think that it's difficult, in some ways to ask the legal office to be the arbiter of this. So I would. I think that this is warrants conversation. I think it warrants investigation. I think I would. I would suggest that we spend the next year answering these questions, making sure that we've identified how it's actually going to happen and if it can actually happen and then come forward in the next fiscal year's budget, because certainly we wouldn't want to do this necessarily for a year. We'd want to start an initiative so that we're talking about a recurring cost. I will note that this is bringing our budget balanced to 15.3%. So it's also bringing us pretty close to that baseline level that we don't want to go under. So again, I think it's great that we're thinking about this, that we're investigating what our options are, but I'd prefer if we did the work first and then came forward with the proposal. Further discussion council member song so when I saw this, I immediately thought of how the county clerk has a directory of elected officials throughout the county at every level, and I imagine that perhaps this could be similar to that, but focus just on the city. Just this past weekend, I was driving through ward three and ran across a flooded street. And when talking to this college student, it was pretty clear they didn't know who their city council rep was. And looking up on the city and looking at the lines and not seeing where the streets are named for our awards. There's a little bit of a guessing game between three and two, but we were able to find their way and situate them. There's incidences where I had to direct foreign nationals who are here through the website. Navigate that. It is really difficult if there was a way to welcome. We have so many new residents here and have this be more accessible, even if it's just a simple one pager on. Here's a two. Fix it. This is who to contact if your garbage isn't picked up. There's just these basic numbers that we can share, and I don't think everyone is on the same page. And understanding how the city functions, especially if you're not coming from, and sometimes it's not even us, even if we can just say, actually, that's Debbie Dingle, it's not us. When it comes to these concerns, it can be really helpful to kind of point to also social service agencies. This week, I had to. I shared Hawke's number with someone who was at risk of losing their housing, the humane society's number, because they couldn't find a place so that they could bring their puppy with them. So all these services that we've known since we've been here for a while, we've lived here for decades, is not so intuitive, I think, for new residents, for students, for international folks. But we do put out communications like our property tax exemption applications at every single public library branch in multiple languages. So if we can follow that kind of path of accessibility, not political, it's just here's who to reach in these instances. Welcome to Ann Arbor. Thank you for staying here. It's something you can put on your fridge. So that's what I'm imagining. So I'm in support of this. Council member. Thank you, mayor. I will acknowledge that when I first saw this one, I was a little torn. As somebody who previously worked in the state legislature, and I think anybody who has received mail from their legislator knows that our state legislature do something similar to this, where, you know, there's a tax tips newsletter that goes out, there's senior information for seniors, information for veterans that goes out from your state legislators offices and from their fund in order to provide informational content to their constituents. And I think that that's what this is intended for as well. And I think, you know, part of my skepticism was very much that I did not want for us to be able to put out editorial newsletters on the taxpayer dime in order to fund something like this. And I appreciate councilmember Iyer for taking my call or talking with me over the weekend about this a little bit more, because I think very much the intent behind this is that the very next step would be for the Edmund committee to start developing rules around what this would look like. And so making sure that we're putting together something, something that is absolutely factual and informational in nature and not something that's editorializing or explaining positions on issues or things like that, but rather as actual functional, helpful information for residents. Obviously, I think one of the things that we've seen a lot in the news right now is some of the members of Congress using their office budget", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Unnamed Initiative for Improved Communication and Engagement", "insights": [{"observation": "There is a digital divide, and there's a need for communication to residents in a variety of different mechanisms to ensure reaching people where they're at.

I think we would need to develop timelines around how far out from an election a newsletter would be able to be sent, things like that to ensure that these aren't campaign materials or used in that way. And so I am willing to support this tonight on the basis that we're providing funding for that process to be developed and for us to be able to continue having this conversation so that we can, we can move this forward and admin, we can develop those processes, we can come to consensus and potentially even vote on what those rules are on how we ultimately would be able to expend these dollars. But if we don't have the funds in it, all of that work wouldn't come to any type of fruition in the next year. So I'm willing to support this on that basis tonight and look forward to that next step. Further discussion. Councilor Ackman, like others have said, I also appreciate the intent behind this. And, you know, I'm very. I think we're all familiar with people that don't know how to access information easily, and I think thinking of this in the larger ecosystem of how we provide information makes a lot of sense. However, like councilmember Briggs, I'm concerned that this is coming right now as an amendment from the general fund for kind of like, from the general fund fund balance for a new thing that still needs to be kind of thought out. So I would also prefer that this gets kind of hashed out in the admin committee and then considered for the next budget cycle as part of the communications budget. Thanks for my part for. I think there's a great deal to be said for the need for us to communicate directly with residents, say us as a municipal organization, for us to communicate with residents about the services that are available, about the changes in the city that might be in the offing, about what it is that we here at city hall are doing to improve the basic services or to provide the basic services upon which people are relying. That communication needs to take a wide variety of forms, and I think it makes all the sense to emphasize our need to access folks who do not follow the twitter, who do not regularly access our website, and so forth. At the same time, I do also share the concern about this rolling through council, perhaps, rather than the city's ordinary communications office, which I think could also provide this function. It is an area of communication to residents, to community members, about what it is that we are doing at city hall for them that does warrant inquiry and augmentation. But for many of the reasons articulated previously from Councilmember Ackman, perhaps, and councilmember Briggs, too, I'm going to take a pass on this particular amendment, but look forward to learning more about what it is that we do with respect to print communication to residents and how that might be optimized to make sure that we hit everybody in the community where they are and where they take in their information. Further discussion Councilmember Watson song so, in doing a little thinking about this, I looked, you know, the city created a equitable engagement committee that came out with an equitable engagement report, and that was released on July 17, 2023. So this was not at all, you know, these, what I'm going to read is a part of the survey and part of this 58 page report that, you know, wasn't written by council. Several survey takers lament the loss of a daily newspaper and feel that in its absence, there is a gap in media coverage. Moreover, the imposition of a paywall on local news is an equity issue raised by some respondents. There are several recommendations for a regular city issued newsletter, in print or digital, that provides updates on projects, events and summarized board slash commission decisions. While an alternative exists to subscribe to specific project updates based on interest or location, residents may miss the wider news cycle or feel overwhelmed with the number of subscription options. So I think that there is a real need for this. I'm not. I'll acknowledge that I'm not very well versed in how exactly the budget of the communications office functions. And I know, for example, there are a lot of. I think that there might be ways, if this. If we were to pursue this, and I think we should talk about it in admin committee, but if we were to pursue this, perhaps there are other communications that might become redundant. Or this could be, you know, our council contact information could be folded into other communications. So, similar to a few of my colleagues, I don't think I will support, or I won't be supporting this tonight. I just want to point that Ann Arbor Public Schools has its own marketing communications team, much like how we do here in the city. And they are former news editors from radio, from print. And it makes a difference how you communicate. I mean, they don't have print. They come from print.

And that's notable in how they share the work of the city, the achievements of the city, or, I'm sorry, of the schools. I'm just looking for a corollary here. So when I think about this amendment, I'm thinking about how, if we can restore faith and confidence in our work here, given there's so much misinformation online, that is politically driven, whereas we can just present the facts of the city, the facts of the city, as is the facts of the city. That's what's to come, how to reach us. And if it's not us, then how to reach the amazing city minister, Milton Dahone and his staff. So, anyways, I don't think I've communicated that well. So maybe it would have been better in print. I've got Briggs dish. Harrison gazed. Thanks. Yeah. I think we can all agree that print communications are, are lacking. And I think there's just a difference between city communications and potentially city council communications. And I was hoping that maybe attorney Cower might be willing to weigh in in terms of any ways that any thoughts around sort of legal implications of having different types of communications, or if there's any feedback on that, and I would welcome hearing it. Thank you. Council member Briggs certainly from the city staffs perspective and the city attorneys office perspective, council members are responsible for their own compliance with campaign finance laws. Of course, were willing to help you navigate that. And without really seeing what this communication will look like, I cannot say one way or the other, but hearing the intent that has been expressed on this floor, it appears the intent is not to have political communications, but to have factual communications. With that intent, I think the communication would be okay, but I cannot say for sure without looking at the actual communication. If we intended for factual information to be communicated, I think it would be safer to have it as a city communication versus a communication from the elected body. You could achieve this intent with an amendment to the amendment by making it a city staff or communications office directed communication. Councillor Briggs, you still have the floor. Councilmember. Dish. I really appreciate all the feedback on this amendment, and I hope that I can say something without appearing self important. But as city council members, we are the face of the city to some of our constituents. And so what is appealing to me about what is proposed here is that there is a personal touch. It isn't, you know, here's the sticker on your trash can. Those have been really effective, actually, the stickers on the recycling bin. Don't put that in. Put this in. But this is. Hi, here's me. And here are some things about the city that you should know, and here are some services I think could help you. And here again is my email address. So. And I am, you know, I would be happy for this to work out any way that it works out, but I just wanted to put that in the mix. Got Harrison, Ghazi, Edwin, I, Rodina, Councilmember Harrison. So I just wanted to also be clear that, you know, prior to why I added myself to this amendment, but I did, you know, I spoke with Councilmember Iyer a couple times. I spoke with her today, and I did have. I did have some concerns about campaign finance violations and laws and. But, you know, and when you're thinking about accessibility, and we know that everyone does not have access to email, you know, what I'm thinking about is for the city to communicate to our residents. Maybe recent policy changes or information, perhaps. Where are the naloxone kits located within the community? Where can you get help? Information about supportive connections, you know, regarding ward specific. For example, OSI is doing a tour, so in different wards. So perhaps, maybe something like that would be added to this. But I just think that. My thought is that basically the city of Ann Arbor would be communicating with our residents about information and that would be helpful for them to know not so much what we are doing. So that anyway, thats the conversation I had earlier and with councilmember Iyer. So thank you, Councilor Ghazi. Edwin, thank you. You know, I just want to echo some of the things that councilmember Harrison shared that I too wanted to clarify. I think that I wanted to clarify that this was not going to be campaigning, it wasn't going to be outreach to our constituents saying like, vote for me. But it's supposed to be objective updates on city services decisions that we made as a body. And also like, who's your council member? And I think having information about who's your council member and my phone number and email shouldn't be, we do serve them and we serve them, you know, as for whatever they need in the wardrobe. And I see this as something that's coming from the city, not coming from city council. So I think that there's some kind of confusion that we all have around this.

So when we start talking about, oh, maybe city staff could actually put this together, now we're talking about a whole different level of funding that we would be necessary because city staff doesn't just have the ability to, you know, just take on something like this. The communications department is actually quite small, and it's not something I've spoken to administrator Duhoni about in terms, because that's not what I was envisioning at all. I was envisioning, we put these together, they get, you know, they get reviewed and then they get printed and sent out. So, yeah, if we're concerned about cost, too. It's just another thing to weigh if we're thinking, oh, we could just have city staff put it together. That raises the cost probably exponentially. Councilmember Rodina, thank you. I have a question for probably Miss Pushon about the. So, you know, if we were to allocate this tonight, and, you know, admin doesn't come to consensus on what the process is or we do, and this moves forward, but council members choose not to exercise this ability and don't use their mailing, would the portion or the entirety of the $100,000 go back to the fund balance, or would it be able to be spent in other ways? Well, technically it could be spent in other ways, but in the end, any unspent funds would be returned to fund balance. Yes. Thank you. Further discussion. Councilmember Watson? To me, I think that there might be a difference between ward specific communication and council member specific communication. So, for example, if two members were to be sending information together, perhaps that creates some check on the, the choices of what goes in it, because it has to be judged by both a senior and a junior member, like what is applicable to the whole ward. But I'm sort of offering that. But I think the stuff I've heard around the table tonight, it seems like there's not a lot of consensus on what exactly the vision is. And I think this is something that, that could be put together and hash out in admin committee, but I think to put a number behind it, and I just think it's not. I think I would honestly support a conversation and amendment later in the year on this if we could put something together. But I think as it is now, I'm just hearing a lot of different ideas around the table. Yeah. Further discussion. Roll call vote, please. Starting with councilmember Briggs on amendment five. Council member Briggs. No. Council member Cornell. Yes. Council member. Dish. Yes. Councilmember Harrison. Yes. Councilmember song. Yes. Council member Watson. No. Council member Rodina. Yes. Council member Ghazi? Edwin. Yes. Mayor Taylor. Yeah. Councilmember Eyre. Yes. Councilmember Ackman. No. Amendment carries further discussion. The main motion is amended. Councilmember Rodina. Thank you, mayor. I move to adopt amendment number six, the amendment to prioritize crosswalk upgrades on Stone School Road. Is there a second 2nd by Councilor Gaziadoin? Council member Abdina, you still have the floor. Oh, thank you very much, Mister Hutchinson. Having waited so patiently, I just pretend, alas, my earnest apologies. No problem. You've had to sit there and look at my face for all we had a couple of questions related to amendment number six. The first one was asking for a list of the enhanced crosswalks under consideration, along with an update on any of the prioritization work that has been done to date. The list of the 32 crosswalk installations and upgrades has been attached to this item and legistar so you can find that there. And that list does include the three locations on Stone School Road that are discussed in this amendment. We have completed the framework for the crosswalk request prioritization system and we're currently working on scoring the locations based on that system. And because budgets are limited, this prioritization system will identify locations that are anticipated to have the biggest impact.

We anticipate having this list of locations prioritized within the next month and then we would be using the results to program future work. And then the second request was asking for an update on the Maple Road RRFB at Dickon woods and I'm happy to report that that crosswalk and RFB were installed earlier this year. And then I am here along with Raymond Hess, our transportation manager, to answer any further questions you may have. Thank you mayor colleagues for context, Stone School Road between Eisenhower and Ellsworth is an area of heavy pedestrian traffic with several townhome, condo and apartment complexes, as well as single family neighborhoods on both sides of the street. Stone school gives residents access to multiple city parks, Bryant Elementary School, the Jewish Community center and their associated early childhood center, and the Jimmy Hill Purple house serving our homeless community. Additionally, as this remains one of Ann Arbor's more affordable areas, a significant number of residents in the apartment and condo complexes across the street daily to access public transit, to get to work, go shopping, or simply move around our city. Children cross the road to access our parks, play basketball at Bryant's School in Clinton park, visit nearby playgrounds and to get to school. Because of all this crosswalk, stone stone school are heavily trafficked. Unfortunately, due to the width of Stone School Road with three vehicle lanes and two bike lanes at one of these crossings, the visibility challenges at both Birch Hollow and pheasant run crosswalks because of their proximity to the I 94 overpass and curves in the roadway, vehicles are regularly traveling at higher than posted rates of speed and fail to yield for pedestrians waiting to cross or worse within the roadway based on engineering staff review of these locations, there now seems to be acknowledgement that these crossings qualify for additional employees improvements, including the addition of rrfbs. Unfortunately, for many years, nearby residents of both the third and fourth wards have been begging their city to help them cross the street safely. They have attended my coffee hours, called and emailed, and because I live near Stone School Road, they regularly stop by my home to ask for updates after experiencing yet another close call. For over three and a half years, I have been trying over and over again to get safe crosswalks on stone School prioritized for over three and a half years. Prior to this evening, I had received no commitment that this roadway would be addressed at all and definitely no timeline to fix the problem. While I appreciate that staff is expected to begin working on prioritizing upgrades to crosswalks, that prioritization work is not complete and lacking prioritization. I am asking council to act I recognize that this amendment is a bit uncomfortable for some of us. We don't typically bring this narrow of a direction to the table. But while we've been lucky, there hasn't been a reported vehicle pedestrian accident in this area since 2019, when a pedestrian was struck by a vehicle after getting off of a city bus. As someone who lives in this area and commutes on this road daily, the near misses, speeding vehicles, and the sheer number of children trying to cross this roadway alone make it only a matter of time. I cannot in good conscience continue to tell my constituents that we know this is problem, this roadway is a problem, but there is no existing plan or timeline to fix it. I ask for your support. Further discussion councilmember Briggs I'd like to thank councilmember Rodeina for trying to elevate the issues around crosswalk safety around need for crosswalk improvements. This is, as you can see from the list of need in our city, this is an ongoing and desperate need in each ward of ours. It is something that I've served on transportation commission. This is my second time now on council. I know councilmember Ackman has as well. We have received. We've received those pleas from all across the city, and I've received them from many of these sites or locations in the fifth ward where I've also heard those same stories. It's one of the reasons we have adopted a vision zero based transportation plan. We are refocusing our resources to invest greater resources in pedestrian safety and bicycle safety because our vulnerable users require that. But I would caution us from picking favorites on this list because we each have them right. We each know that there are places in our ward that require safety improvements yesterday. What we need to do, as difficult as it is, is to allow for a prioritization model to be able to rank all of these different factors. And I'm not sure that, you know, if there's a problem in that process, then, you know, then we need to improve the process.

But to identify one spot in the city above all others, I think, jeopardizes this work that we're trying to do uniformly across our city. Further discussion. Councilmember Gazier. So this is something that I support, because I, too, have heard from many ward residents just how vulnerable of an area this is in regards to safety concerns. And as you know, the resolution stipulates and councilmember Rodeana has shared, this area is heavily trafficked by numerous vulnerable populations. Children, older adults, people, you know, getting services at different service organizations. Organizations. And we know, based upon the analysis by the engineering staff, that it requires additional improvement. And I, too, worry that if we don't prioritize this now, we're going to inevitably see something that we could have prevented, such as a pedestrian accident. So I'm supporting this tonight, and I think, as well, that ward three, being the most socioeconomically diverse, it's really important that we think about accessibility and infrastructure and safety across the board, both physically and in all ways. Councilor Ackman, I have some things to say, but first, I have a question, because one thing that I noticed that's not on this list is Jackson, where we know somebody was killed, and there's a crosshair being installed. So can you tell me why Jackson road is not on this list? That one is actually in progress. I can turn it over to Raymond Hess here for a timeline, but. So that's why it's not on the list, is because it's already actively being done. Yay. Yeah. That's correct, Nick. We are putting American Rescue planning Act funds towards those ARPA funds. And so we are continuing to work with MDOT on the permitting process. And so we are waiting final direction on MDOT for those installations. Thank you so much. So, you know, I want to echo my appreciation for elevating this issue. It's important. I understand why you care. I understand why you want to advocate for this. But I look at this list of 32 items, many of them that I've been directly involved with communications on, and I see many of the traits that you've cited at this table with the ones that I'm familiar with, vulnerable populations, proximity to school. Some of these are actually five lanes, not just three lanes. So I cannot in good conscience sit at this table tonight without a prioritization enumeration and say that your particular site deserves to be above all the rest. I just can't do that. So I won't be supporting this tonight. Further discussion Councillor Cornell, I actually have a question, especially since we have Mister Hess here for a very limited time. Might as well put him in the hot seat so he remembers us fondly. The list of 32 as the prioritization after the prioritization takes place, what is the timeline for completing all 32? Yeah, it's a good question. Some of the improvements will cost more than others. So, as councilmember Ackman just mentioned, and for example, a crosswalk across a five lane section of roadway would, per our crosswalk design guidelines suggest that an overhead RRFB would be warranted, possibly with the installation of pedestrian refuge islands. So that could cost upwards of $100,000. Whereas side mounted rrfvs, which is the more traditional installation where you have dual faced rectangular reps, rapid flashing beacons on either side of the roads, the yellow signs with flashing lights, those are about $20,000 for a new installation. So it's really a question of matching, you know, those needs against the funding, against the prioritization, and kind of chipping away at those as much as possible. I will note we did get a congressional earmark, which we hope to augment some of this implementation as well. I actually just sent a note to Michigan Department of Transportation during this meeting indicating that we do want to kind of advance that project forward so there will be some additional funds that we can put towards this. But again, the idea is we would just kind of follow the prioritization ranking and address those, you know, kind of from top to bottom. Further discussion of the amendment council member song I approached councilmember Briggs enactment about a similar issue in April, and just checking to see if there was an appetite for an amendment specifically on traffic calming. I think for all of us, that's a top priority, or that's an issue that a lot of our constituents bring up. And as we try to kind of find ways to support families around schools in the area, it's a pretty constant request. And I have an email from councilmember Ackman reminding me that we did last year make traffic calming a consideration in all road reconstruction projects. So it's a conversation that's in the CIP. As much as I wanted to support this particular amendment, I think that reminder was a really good reminder that we have a process and that we have, we are prioritizing traffic calming as it comes and as funding comes.

So hopefully Mister Raymond and Mister Hutchinson can find more funding throughout the year and perhaps we can revisit a time when we will find more state funding for safer access school. So, I'm really sorry. I did want to support this. I really did. But I had to really think about the process, and again, how we've already committed to this being in the CIP. Further discussion. Council member, thank you. And I also just want to stress, you know, that I knew this was going to be an uphill battle tonight. I don't know exactly how the vote will go yet. But, you know, this is something that I think, unfortunately, this is coming forward tonight because I don't think our process is currently adequate. And some of that is the decisions we're making tonight about the, frankly, kind of paltry sum of money that we're putting into this as a whole. I think $250,000 is what's budgeted for this work across the city. And we just heard that one of these might cost 100, and there's a list of 32. And so as we continue to think about the kids who cross these streets and don't have any way of alerting the traffic that they're about to cross, you know, I am open to working with anyone at this body on either a mid year amendment or amendments for future years to make sure that we are putting more money into this, because these roadways simply are not safe, and it is only a matter of time. Council member Harrison, thank you. I just wanted to say that I wanted to support it as well. However, actually, council member Rodeina is familiar with discussions I've been having about du Varen Road and the challenges, well, challenges the gap in sidewalks. We've got Avalon housing. So we have, you know, vulnerable community members that are living off of Duveren that don't have vehicles. I've seen mothers with their babies, you know, walking, trying to get to the library, really walking in the street. I've seen one of my constituents is in a motorized wheelchair and is often, you know, traveling along Duvern Road with no sidewalks and trying to travel on the bike lanes, which. And really, he's in the street. That individual is in the street. I have had conversations with my state rep. I am continuing to look for funding sources, but like I said, wanting to support this. However, I know, and I've had some discussions, I think, with some of my other peers here in this body about this du Baron road. So unfortunately, unable to support it this evening, even though I wanted to. But thank you for the work on it. Further discussion councilmember breaks yeah, and I guess I'd like to just draw attention to much of the transportation work that we're trying to do around the city now is to improve the non, improve the safety of all users. And so when can we bring forward resolutions that are around road reconfigurations that are about reducing road widths from five to three lanes? That's about slowing traffic. And what that allows is for those crosswalks to be more visible for traffic to have a, it makes those crosswalk improvements less costly. It allows drivers to be able to see those, those crosswalks better. Bike lanes don't just serve to serve bicyclists, they also serve to narrow the roadway and to calm traffic and to reduce crashes for motor vehicles. We have a lot of the work that we're doing is interrelated and it is all about trying to both improve the accessibility of our community and improve the safety of our residents. So, you know, more and more we're seeing our budgets aligned with the way that our people are trying to move around our city. And you're right, we need more resources for this. This is a biennial budget. But next year, Mister Dahoni, it's an opportunity to be making sure that we're drawing as many of our resources as we can to, to advancing our active, in our vision, zero based transportation plan and the goals of it. So I completely agree. These are priorities. It's priority for all of our residents all across the city. They deserve to be able to cross the street without being killed. Our kids deserve to be able to walk to school without necessarily having to be, have a parent by their side until they're, you know, way into high school. So, you know, there's a lot of work that we need to be doing in our community to improve the safety and accessibility. Councilmember Cornell so I had heard from constituents and my colleague's word about stone school. I think we've heard it several times here at the table and I came in supporting this and now I'm realizing, I think my, what I'm hoping I'm hearing from my colleagues is that when this prioritize, prior, that is such a hard word.

Throng councilor dish. Councilor, I just wanted to say what a helpful and thoughtful discussion this has been. And I appreciate that there's been a distinction made between the prioritization of the 32 items on the list and the pot of money that's available to execute the improvements that we need to execute. And because I am. I am. One of the things I've learned on this body is that it is really excellent to have staff prioritize, because they see things much more broadly than I do. And I really trust. I really trust staff's prioritization. I was going to say I often do, but I really want to say that I do. The constraints we've been working against constraints with a lot of things, with our traffic calming program, and we figured out how to speed that one up because there were so many people who wanted them, and we used to have a backup of. It seemed like it was nine years. And I think that that got considerably shortened. And so I think what we need to do is work on. We, as a body, need to put some serious thought into our priorities. And I think that we. I love everything we're doing, and I think it's all urgent, but we are spreading ourselves too thin. And I think we are going to need for the next biennial budget, which will bring us up against the structural deficit. I think we're going to need to do some hard thinking about what we're willing to give up in order to accomplish very well some of the basic, crucial things that we believe people deserve in the city. And so that's a charge to us. But the other kind of prioritization about what, where? That's for staff. Further discussion. Roll call, though, please, starting with councilmember Briggs. Council member Briggs. No. Council member Cornell? No. Council member dish? No. Council member Harrison? No. Council member song? No. Council member Watson? No. Council member Rodina? Yes. Councilmember Ghazi Edwin. Yes. Mayor Taylor? No. Council member augher? No. Council member Ackman? No. The amendment fails. Further discussion of the main motion has amended, that is to say, the budget. Councilmember Adina. I just want to acknowledge all of the incredible staff work and time that goes into preparing this budget for us every year. We're all looking at it on our screens right now, but we also get a hard copy, and it is a thick binder, and that's not even all of the details. And so a ton of work, a ton of hours go into this every year. And then they have to answer a lot of questions from us and be responsive to all of our requests and our amendments and all of those things. And a lot of the conversations and discussions we have don't even make it to amendments. And so I just want to express gratitude to all of our staff who have to put work into this throughout the organization and also just say, I am once again proud to be able to vote for this budget tonight because it puts a lot of money into the values that we hold dear as a community, from our sustainability work, to our pedestrian and cycling safety work, to renewable energy and an energy future. And so there is so much to be proud of in this, I think we have just had a conversation about ways that we may want to continue to adjust and tweak those priorities in the future. And that's the exciting part about being able to revisit this every two years. We revisit every year, but we really pass a comprehensive budget every two years. And so thank you to the staff and my colleagues for their thoughtful consideration in this work. Council member Dish, I also want to add my voice to what will be, I think, a pretty large chorus of praise for the budget. In the past couple of years, the budgets have been much more easily digestible because they had a clear focus, and this year's focus was on horizon issues as well as immediate issues. And that has been very helpful because in every area of this city, big needs are coming up because of the age of everything in this city. And so I have really appreciated how easy it has been to get a grasp of the whole, sometimes just the lines, line after line after line, very hard to abstract from that. And I feel that we've really been given a bird's eye level view as well as the detailed view, and it's made deliberation about the budget very easy and fruitful. Councilmember Briggs, I, too, would like to thank staff. Obviously, this is a comprehensive. There's a lot in this budget, and it says a lot that what we did was not to pull out things that the administrator had proposed, but to try to add in, you know, make sure that we had some additional priorities that we focused our attention on.

Councilmember Briggs, I, too, would like to thank staff. Obviously, this is a comprehensive. There's a lot in this budget, and it says a lot that what we did was not to pull out things that the administrator had proposed, but to try to add in, you know, make sure that we had some additional priorities that we focused our attention on. I appreciate all of the staff responses to the questions that we asked, and particularly I had asked a number of questions around the development of an economic development office. And, you know, a lot of my concerns this year were around funding. But this is the one. This is the one area that when we invest, hopefully some resources in, there will be. Hopefully it's the one area that we'll see revenue coming back to the city in a few years. The fact is that a city of our size should have a strategy that we're implementing around economic development and we should have a coordinated effort around that. And that requires staff. So I appreciate the work for staff for bringing that in. We don't usually see those sort of changes in this sort of in between year, but I think it was important for us to get started sooner rather than later. The one thing that I asked a budget question around that was told that I did not need to introduce a budget amendment, but I would have was a small element around salt usage. And that is something I'm glad to see that we. Yep. So, you know, I think as we're clearing roads, what we heard after this last winter was there were some challenges with getting our car lanes and our bike lanes cleared. And I'm glad that we have a different strategy mode moving forward. Different equipment and different. We're going to be implementing some different policies around, potentially around where folks need to park after a big winter storm. But I don't think that that means that we need to also simultaneously increase our salt usage. We have environmental policies that we have in place to try to minimize those. And so I think it's important that we take this in stages and see what success we have as we implement new infrastructure and new parking policies on our street and then, you know, and then evaluate what our options are in our success. Council member song immediately after this meeting, I think I'll be joining a number of Ann Arbor parents and watching the school board meeting, and I mention that because I think we've had a lot of questions around how does our budgeting, how does our work impact the schools and vice versa. And I know we've had discussions on, well, one, clarifying that we're two separate entities helps, but we are reliant on the other. Right? Like our success is dependent on the essential success of our schools. And we have had these conversations on how we can be supportive of families here. I did ask if there's any way that we could give a tax benefit to new families moving to the area so that we could have more students in our public schools, and was reminded that we live in the state of Michigan. And in the state of Michigan, municipalities cannot give those kind of special favors or incentives. But, you know, I think it's worth mentioning that, you know, everyone here has tried to at least look to how our budget can be supportive of schools. You know, I learned that parks does not charge for when and our public schools conducts their summer camps on our parks property. And, you know, just seeing things like, you know, increasing fees so that we can keep Macpool open is also in support of our public schools. So every which way that we can find a way to support families in our geography. I'm really appreciative of how that's reflected in the budget because we are very, very expensive and there are fewer children with lack of childcare. So in improving tonight's budget, I really appreciate all the conversations from administration, administration from council members in engaging our school board trustees and our state reps in reflecting on what we can do to just lighten in any way the burden that our schools face. Councilor Breyer, thank you. I, too, wanted to chime in with my gratitude towards staff and in particular the inclusion of the economic Development office and getting that launched right away. We in April declared that housing, we have a housing crisis, we have a housing shortage, and we need to get moving as quickly as possible. And here we are moving because the centerpiece of that work is housing. It's how do we allow for more housing to be built as quickly as possible where it makes sense in the city? And then on the heels of that, of course, are the amendments related to planning, again, looking at how we can get changes, necessary changes that support housing growth through the process as quickly as possible, which is exactly what we wanted to do when we passed those four resolutions in April. So appreciate the work of staff and my colleagues on those amendments and looking forward to wrapping this up. Further discussion Councilmember Cornell, I will also thank staff for great work on the budget. And I wanted to council members dish and I, Briggs already touched on things, so I just want to say that I too, am very enthusiastic to see these economic development initiatives move forward with some budget dollars behind them.

Further discussion Councilmember Cornell, I will also thank staff for great work on the budget. And I wanted to council members dish and I, Briggs already touched on things, so I just want to say that I too, am very enthusiastic to see these economic development initiatives move forward with some budget dollars behind them. And to councilmember Briggs point, it feels weird because it's like 85 degrees out, but I'm all about snow today. If you look at the questions that were asked of staff around some of these budget items, I, too, asked about salt and salt usage. I obviously am very committed to our environment and understanding the runoff and just the impact of that, I think is really important as a community, again, to reflect our values. But I am interested to see how staff is able to take some of the new equipment that we allocated budget for around snow removal. The new ordinance that was passed, and maybe put an environmentally friendly lens on the products that we're using in the streets to determine if they're just necessary, or if there's a way we could be better with that expense and environmental factor as well. So, thank you, everyone. Council member Harrison. I just want to echo the sentiments of my peers in thanking the staff and administrator Dahoni for all the work on the budget. So, thank you. Appreciate it. Further discussion. Council member Watson? I wanted. I mean, I wanted to draw a little attention to the fact that I'm looking at the slides from the 24 budget, and there was a projection for expenditures to exceed revenues by 3.1 million in 2026. And I think in FY 2026, and I think that's either decreased to the projection now for FY 2026 is either, I think, zero or 100, somewhere between zero or $125,000. So why is there. Why has the outlook improved so much? And I mean, the answer is a little bit of the state shared revenue. And obviously, the fact that the good side, I guess, of inflation, is that the taxes are allowed to increase by that amount. So our revenues, when we had projected the revenue revenues to grow by 6%, they've grown by 8%. And so that gives me some optimism for the ability to keep delivering, keep these programs that are going, and keep delivering services at the level we want. But I do echo the sentiments of councilmember Briggs, and so I acknowledge some caring caution going forward. But I wanted to point out that our projections have been adequately conservative in that we're headed toward a good fiscal situation in the FY 2026 range. The other thing I wanted to say is, we talked a lot about the marijuana money not being permanent. And one of the reasons that isn't permanent is because there's been a lot of consolidation in the marijuana industry. And we get funding on a per license basis. It's something like $60,000 license. So if stores consolidate or close, that's money we lose. And that's why we can't count on that money being stable just yet. It's not because we don't like the programs we're delivering, it's because there's a lot of change in that industry right now. Council member brakes. Thanks. I just realized it might be nice to acknowledge some of the folks that are in the audience that have managed to stay here until 10:00 at night. So, thank you so I know that also elements that are in the budget that weren't debated were, but appreciate administrator Dahoni, including them, were funding for the phase two feasibility study. And I know that that was something that a two public power was strongly advocating for. So and trying to raise awareness around the need for that work. And also, Mister Kelly is here from the Delaunay center and I'm glad to see that, which is in ward five. So just this was something that we included in the budget last year and advocated for it to be there. And this year there's funding that has been placed there by the administrator. Kind of slightly different programming, but around recovery services and really important funding in our community. As we've seen, needs go up. So thank you for sticking around this evening and for your advocacy and your work. And thank you to all. Further discussion so here at city hall, we deliver clean water. We channel stormwater and we clean wastewater. We keep people safe with outstanding and professional police and fire services. We build streets, sidewalks and bike lanes, designing our streets for all users. We provide beautiful parks and open spaces. We support our downtown. We plan the built environment for now and the future. We inspect rental units and building sites and trade work to ensure safety. We collect solid waste as we recycle and compost. We provide human services support. We build affordable housing to fight economic and racial inequality. And we sprint towards community wide carbon neutrality. This is the work of your municipal organization. The work of your municipal organization is accomplished through our budget. This is a balanced budget that accomplishes what our community demands to improve basic services and enhance quality of life. It does so with momentum and vision and practicality. It is the budget of your municipal organization that is devoted to making our community better, with a drive to deliver the basics that never loses sight of equity needs and our many and exciting opportunities in the future.

The ZBA, as you probably know, hears applications from those who want an exception to the city's zoning ordinance or those who want to do renovation to properties that do not conform to the current rules of the zoning ordinance. It is composed of nine volunteers, Ann Arbor residents, and we have been nominated by the mayor and then confirmed by city council. So we have four applications tonight. For each of the four applications, we'll proceed as follows. First, we will hear from the city staff in the person of John Barrett, the city zoning coordinator, to my right here, and we may ask questions of him about his staff report. Secondly, we'll hear from the applicant, and applicants have five minutes to speak and we may ask questions of each applicant. Thirdly, we will take small opinions from people pro and con who are physically here in the room, and those of you who are here physically will have three minutes. Those who are watching the ZBA meeting remotely will also have three minutes to speak, and I will now tell you how to access the ZBA meeting. If you are not here physically to speak remotely, press star nine if listening by phone or use the raise hand feature. If you are using the web link, the number for phone access is as follows. I'll repeat it twice. 877-853-5247 again, 877-853-5247 and the meeting id, which I'll repeat twice. 9381-6481-0079-3816-4810-07 the city staff will select callers that have raised their hand using the last three digits of your phone number or your name. If you've made it available on your web link. And please, if you are speaking remotely, move to a quiet area so if you have your tv or computer on, we don't get some feedback. Lastly, step number five. We'll acknowledge letters and emails that we may have received about the application, and that'll end sort of the public discussion. We will then go into discussion among the members here. We will come up with a motion and we will vote on the motion. In order for an application to pass, it needs five yes votes. If people do not get their application approved, they may then choose to go to the Washtenaw county circuit Court by filing a timely appeal. The first order of business is a roll call and let me go through the names. Our regular chairperson, Candace, is absent and my name is Todd Grant. I'm the vice chair. As you can see from my nameplate here. I am here Dave Devarti? Devarti? Here. Chris Madigan? Not here. Julie Weatherby? Here. Grace Whitney. Here. Mike Daniel. Here. Dharma Ackman. Here. And Christina Glusack. Here. Let me say two things about our members. Julie Weatherby used to be on the zoning board of Appeals, and she is back. So we have an experienced member and sadly, one of our members, Grace Whitney. This is her last meeting today. She will not be here here after today. So. So we have. You have the agenda in front of you. Is there a motion to approve the agenda as is so moved? Second. All in favor? Aye. Okay, the agenda is approved.

This is looking at it from the other street on north fifth, looking at it from the back side of the house. This is the rear elevation of the property. This is looking at the rear yard. As you can see, the rear yard is very limited in the adjacent property on the background. And just another angle of the side of the house. And where the proposed addition is going to be the driveway. And this is looking at the abutting property. And that's all I have at this time. And I'll take any questions that the board may have. Any questions for John? All right. Seeing none, no. We wish to hear from the applicant. Please sign in, sir, and state your name clearly. Hello, I'm Michael Bildee, owner and chieftainer for 305 peaks. I've owned the building quite a while, but we would like to update it with better bathrooms and adding the laundry upstairs, as John mentioned. And there's no radon system then? It was renovated before that was required or a thing. And this would give us the opportunity to put a passive system in. And the roof is being designed so that it'll structurally support solar. And we're also exploring some of the small rooftop windmills, but I'm not sure if that will happen. I own other buildings in the area and we're trying to get several solar installations at the same time. Any questions for Mister Goby? All right, well, thank you, sir. Is there anyone in the audience who wishes to speak for or against this application? All right, none. Is there anybody remote? Courtney? There are no callers. All right. And I don't think we received any letters or emails about this. No. Okay, so now we are among discussion for the members here. Wow, we're a taciturn group today. Good. Dave? This is a small, minimal addition that will significantly improve the property without further encroaching in the setbacks. It's asking for an alteration to a non conforming structure. The standards for which approval are minimal and is hearing. I don't see any reason to oppose this. I think it'll be a benefit to the community and a benefit to the people that live there. Good. I said, any other comments? Well, I guess we're ready for a motion. Okay. ZBA 240-01-8518 west summit street or that's wrong. Sorry about that. I'm moving one ahead. We're in 17. Here we are.

Thomas Waters property owner is seeking a 15 foot variance from section 518.5 averaging an established front building. The property is applying for a land division to create a new parcel on the fountain street side of the lot. The average front setback is 40ft on the fountain street side and the owner is seeking to reduce the front setback to 25ft. The property is owned two real a two family dwelling district. The subject property is located at the intersection of West Summit Street, Hillcrest Drive and Fountain street in the Water Hill neighborhood. The home was built in 1901 and is approximately 1176 sqft in size. The parcel contains 12,022, has frontage along Hillcrest Drive and Fountain street. Section 518.5 requires an average front setback for residential existing own properties be measured from adjacent homes within 100ft on the same side of the street as the subject property. The three properties to the north of the subject property have front setbacks that exceed the 40 foot maximum that can be applied. Therefore, the established average front setback along Fountain street for the subject property is 40ft, which exceeds the r two a district requirement of 25ft. If you'll turn your attention to the monitors you'll see the first slide shows the zoning map and the subject parcel is highlighted in the center of your screen. And as I stated, it's all. Most of the properties in the surrounding area are all zoned two a the next slide is the aerial map showing surrounding properties and existing conditions. And the next slide shows the zoomed in aerial photo of the subject property. Hillcrest Drive is on the east west, Summit street is to the south and Fountain street is on the west side. The next slide shows the survey that has been submitted with the application. As you can see the applicant and the surveyor have proposed the land division. And you see the property line right here where my cursor is circling and that's the proposed land division. And then on this side of the street would be one of the frontages and that's where the applicant is seeking to reduce it from 40ft down to 25. On this side of the lot. This is the photo of the property when I was out there on the site inspection you see the front elevation of the home along summit. This is the home on the Hillcrest side. On the east side of the lot this is looking down Hillcrest. You get a feel for the neighborhood and the adjacent properties. And then this is looking on the west side of the lot where the proposed land division is going to be. And it serves as the. As the backyard now. And in the background you see that's the fountain street side of the property. This is looking at the corner. I'm staying at the corner fountain and summit looking towards the home. And this is the backyard where the new proposed lot is to be divided. This is looking along the homes to the north and the backside of them. And then this is looking along Fountain street. You see to the right side is all along the visual of what fountain street looks like to the north of Summit street. This is looking at the backs of the homes along Fountain street. And as you can see when you measure from the lot line, they're all through lots. When you measure from the lots, the front lot line on fountain to the back it exceeds the 40ft but you use the maximum of 40ft for the measurement for the front lot line. Just another shot of one of the adjacent homes to the north and that will conclude my presentation. But I will show one more thing. So you have a front yard along here along the fountain. You have a front yard along west summit. Because every, every front lot, every lot line that fronts a public right away is a front yard. And so if you were to measure the front setback, since it's a through lot, they've got double frontage. They really don't have a rear yardage. These houses have two front yards. That's more than 40ft. That's more than 40ft. That's more than 40ft. The maximum average you can fly is 40ft. So it would be along here. And they're requesting to reduce down to 25. I hope I've made that clear and I can take any questions that you may have at this time. I think, darn, this hand is up first. And grace. So I have a question about. It sounds like the two a zoning category. The standard is 25ft. The district requirement. Yes, it's 25. So why does the. I don't understand why the average trumps the standard. Can you explain that to me? Always does. The average is the precedent when for lots that are already developed. If it was a vacant lot or a newly planted subdivision, then you would use the district. So like if the house established lot, we have to do the averaging. So if the existing house was torn down, for example, then what standard would apply? It would still be using the standard along these. On both sides. Okay. So if they decide to do the land division and then the other house, the existing house is torn down, they'll have the average along. I take the average along those first three houses to the north, whatever that is. And since those are so close, it might be 17 or 18ft. Sometimes the average works for you and sometimes it works against you. And in this case, for the newly proposed lot on the west side of the property, it's working against them. Okay, thanks. And I think. Grace, your hand is up first. Yeah. I have two questions kind of in line with Darmus. First, so the. The created vacant or the newly created lot that doesn't have anything on it that they're asking for the variance for. That doesn't count as vacant. It is gonna. It is vacant, but all the rest of the lots are already. Oh, because the other ones are not vacant. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. And then have there been any like drawings or anything submitted for what is planned to be built there or.", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Thomas Waters Property", "insights": [{"observation": "Thomas Waters property owner is seeking a 15 foot variance from section 518.5 averaging an established front building.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The property is applying for a land division to create a new parcel on the fountain street side of the lot.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The average front setback is 40ft on the fountain street side and the owner is seeking to reduce the front setback to 25ft.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Thomas Waters Property", "insights": [{"observation": "Thomas Waters property owner is seeking a 15 foot variance from section 518.5 averaging an established front building.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The property is applying for a land division to create a new parcel on the fountain street side of the lot.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The average front setback is 40ft on the fountain street side and the owner is seeking to reduce the front setback to 25ft.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1159900, "chunk_end_time": 1581948, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwuFQDr-xYo", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwuFQDr-xYo&t=1159s"}, {"start": 14000, "end": 20000, "text": "these.

It either can be a single family home or it could be a duplex. Okay. And your second question? No, that was okay. That was okay. And Dave, so all of these properties front on Hill. On Hillcrest. And these are really backyards. I also want to tape note and later in discussion talk about the fact that there are no sidewalks on either side of this street north of Summit, except for maybe two lots well down on the west side of Fountain, which I see as a detriment to pedestrian communication in the neighborhood. My question, if they split the lot like this, does it, that lot split meets all of our standards for the zoning code that they could build on that new lot. Yeah. It will meet the area and lot width requirements. Okay. And then if we pass this setback variance now that will continue with the lot when it splits. So that that would become the front setback of 25ft. Of 25ft on Fountain. To the north of this are also very deep lots, but much narrower. If we see people coming in like the neighbors coming in and asking for lot splits. Do you see those as potentially complying with the lot area for the zoning without doing an analysis? But they most likely would need variances on the lot width because they're not going to meet the lot width of 40ft. I don't believe. I don't know if they would meet the lot area as well either. They're going to need 40ft of lot width and they're going to need 5000 sqft if the other one's to the north. But as you can see, those are much narrower. Yes, I do. I saw that when I was there. And then the last question. If there's a building, if they proceed with the lot division and build on it, there will be requirements for some amount of open space on the new lot. Correct. They can't just build it. They'll have to meet the setbacks all the way around the sides. And the rear. And the rear. Okay, those are all my questions. Thank you. Anyone else? I have a couple of questions. John? The staff report notes that the expression is the rest of the houses along Fountain street. That is, assuming those that are not involved in averaging the setback all have setbacks of about 25. That's what your report says. I guess looking at this point here. In other words, the 40ft applies because of the neighboring homes. So that's the applicant's response. Oh, okay. You see where it says applicant response? Okay, that really ties into my next one. On page three of the applicant's response, they had the setbacks of different properties. Were you able to confirm those? Actually, because they all look like are significantly under 40ft. So what do you. What's the question? In other words, what I'm getting at is that the neighboring properties, their setbacks are more than 40ft. So that's imposing the 40ft requirement on this. On this on the applicant's property. But the other homes in the neighborhood, so to speak, are along the street. All have setbacks that are 25ft plus or minus a few feet. That's really what I'm getting at, asking the question more clearly. So, like in this photo that you see right in front of you, this zoomed in aerial photo. If you look at the homes on Hillcrest on that side, they're all less than 25ft to the south. You have 25ft for maybe one and then 18 for the next one. So, yes, the answer would be the majority of the neighborhood does not have a 40 foot setback. Got you. This is a unique situation because of the layout of these properties and also because they're through lots. Most of the other lots wouldn't have a through lot situation, but these do because they flood on two different streets. Got you. And a question I've asked before with other applicants is if it were but for the averaging setback, they would not need to be in front of us today. That's correct. Okay, good. Thank you. All right. Any other questions? Yes, Christina, but maybe it's to the applicant. So on the top of page 32, regarding the black walnut landmark tree. So I'm not looking at page 32. It's at the top. It's under a. For their practical difficulties. What are these? I didn't get. Oh, yeah. Now I see it. Okay. So it seems like that's the baseline for them to arrive at the calculation of asking for the 15 foot setback. John, is that your understanding? That's sort of like their baseline, the critical root zone of that landmark walnut tree. So that's one of their contentions, that with this increased setback, that might affect the root zone of this tree. Yeah. So that's one of the applicants required, but that's more for them to. Yeah, understood. Okay, thanks. I'm good. Okay. I think we're ready to hear from the applicant. Sign in, sir. State your name. Hi, I'm Tom Waters. That's my wife, Jess. Wonderful. And sign in.

Thank you. And you have five minutes. Thank you. I'm Tom Waters. It sounds like you guys have a pretty thorough perspective on at least the way that I see kind of the conditions surrounding this land division request. We tried to balance the need for density on the newly. The perspective of a newly created parcel with some balance of trying to protect the tree that's on our parcel. And with that, this 40 foot setback, kind of as we went through that land division process, it looks, I think, a little bit odd within the neighborhood. And so that was really the basis for why we requested the variance. Now, before we go through the land division, as we were given guidance by Grayson, that it would make more sense to get the variance in advance of the land division because it's as the part. As the survey is created, this is kind of the time to do it. Any questions for Mister Waters? Yes, Christina. Did you have a professional identify that critical root zone of the. That was as defined in the UDC? So that was based on the calculation. So when we had the property survey, they measured the base of the walnut tree, which was 46 inches. And based on the calculation that's required in the UDC, that would be that boundary that's in that drawing, if you're looking at it would be the 46 foot radius from the center point of the wall on the tree as defined by the UBC calculation. Okay, now I see the drawing. My wife is a master gardener, so that was kind of the other side of it. So it all was informing it. Okay, thank you. Okay, any other questions? All right, thank you, sir. Thank you. And anybody in the audience that wishes to speak. Yes, sir. Come forward. Sign in and state your name clearly. My name is Bruce McCollan and I live at 510 West Summit, where my wife and I have lived for the last 42 years. And where is that in relation to. It's across Hillcrest Court. Thank you. You have three minutes, sir. Okay. I strongly support this. However, my basic whipple is that the setback should be reduced to 15ft. If you look at the by, my profession is I'm an architect. And I've been working on development of difficult lots for very long time. And in fact, I designed and helped build the affordable housing duplex at 517 West Summit, across the street. If you look at the houses, that set of houses on summit and the houses on Hillcrest Court, they are all typically about 30ft from the pavement. And if we wanted to maintain that, we would need to cut the setback down to about 15ft. And the reason I really am concerned about this is the lots to the north. I know that they're small and they're not compliant. And if they were split, they'd probably have to be combined. But because of the increasing property values, there's more pressure on the purchasers to buy smaller houses and add on to them. And we see that at the house, which you saw on the slides that was under construction. Some of our neighbors bought the house and they're doubling the size of it to about 2100. They were sort of the first ones to realize that the people they bought it from that if they jack the price up enough, if people start looking, hey, we can add onto these houses, that's going to increase the property values. Now if somebody wanted to buy one of those houses and either put a second large house, like two 2500 square foot houses or a 4500 square foot house on that site, yes, you can do it. But I would like to be able to be able to continue the kind of smaller house development on those five lots that potentially five lots that are directly north and that would fit best if you keep the, would have the potential to come and ask for variances on those setbacks to a lower number. So I think I missed perhaps what you intend is the critical point. What does the other 10ft give you? Is it a better sight line with respect to the other properties? I've missed that. If you look at the lots that are outlined in orange, if you just draw a line right down the middle, say okay, sometime in the future they would be able to split them off. You would want those houses to reflect the ones that are on the opposite side and have a smaller setback and have a setback from the street, that would be equivalent to what everybody else is doing.

And I don't think we received any letters or emails. Okay. All right, so we are in discussion, Dave. So I'm always willing to say why don't we go with the standard district requirements when we see these excessive setbacks coming in, especially in a situation like this where they're clear measuring. Is these what was developed as black backyards? So I think that 25ft is reasonable. The concern I have is there's not a sidewalk on either side of Fountain street. So for pedestrians, especially somebody with a stroller, they're in the street and that's a concern that I have. And I see a needle for the city to get a sidewalk on at least one side of these streets to the south of summit there are sidewalks. There's a nice park here. Belize park is right across the street from this parcel. And I frequently. I have some friends that live on both fountain and on minor. I frequently see families or small children playing in Belize park. So I know that there are families here with small children in strollers or sometimes not strollers but just walking along. So my concern long term for the city is to get some sidewalks in here on one or the other side of Fountain street. But in terms of the setback request, I'm for it. Grace. Oh, there we go. I do have a quick question for John, I guess related to Dave's concern. Is there a requirement for the city if somebody is developing that lot to put in a sidewalk? I mean I've worked places where that's required and I know it's not everywhere. I just. There is not. Okay. And then not a question. But I just wanted to say that I also support this request. I think the point of having the average setback requirement is to provide a consistency in neighborhood character in certain places. And I think that requiring this to be set back 40ft is really not consistent with how the rest of the neighborhood looks. And I definitely feel that asking for the 25ft which is the district setback in my mind qualifies as a minimal request. I would like to say that we did receive two letters of support. One from Kate and Dale Rominski at 619 west summit and one from Molly and Uri at 813 Hillcrest. Good. Well, I just like to comment on sidewalks. There are sidewalks in my neighborhood, Orchard Hills. But regardless of whether they're pushing a baby stroller or running or walking two by two, people still favor the street. The middle of the road instead of the sidewalk. I can't really explain that, but. Any other discussion points? Okay, I think we're ready for motion. Dave. Okay. ZBA 240-01-8518 Summit street. In accordance with the established standards for approval, the zoning board of Appeals hereby grants a 15 foot variance from section 518.5. Averaging an established front building line requirement of 40ft. The variance allows for a land division to be completed with a new parcel on the west side of the property to have the reduced average front set back along the fountain street side of the property.

We now move on to our third applicant, 305 East Eisenhower Parkway, ZBA number 24 0019. Jim Johnson representing the property owner is seeking a variance from section 524.5, subsection B, permanent signs, other mixed use and non residential and special purpose districts. The total signage for the property currently is nonconforming. The office building has 416 signage involving a double sided freestanding sign and three wall signs. The applicant is seeking to install two new wall signs totaling 85. Property is permitted a maximum of 200 signage. The property is owned tc one transit corridor district. The subject property is located at the northeast corner of South Main street and East Eisenhower Parkway north of Briarwood Mall. The three story office building was constructed in 1988. The property currently has three wall one is Andrews Hooper Pavlich which is 80.75. Number two is preferred title which is approximately 89.3 which is the Brighton office Center. Of 22 wall signs total 192 freestanding sign along East Eisenhower contains 112 sqft on two sides for a total of 224. Applicants are proposing to install the two wall signs for Bank Michigan. One of the wall signs is 70, other is 15 sqft in size. The existing wall signs were installed in 2017 and 2018 and the freestanding sign was installed in September of 2005.

The next slide shows the bank of America signage that's being proposed. You see the one up on the third story or up here up top and then one down below? Those are the two wall signs that are being proposed for a total of 85 sqft. These are the photos that I took on my site inspection. You see the two wall signs right there at the corners of the building. This is the freestanding sign and that's the other side of it. And this is what's existing out there now we'll have to ask the applicant to explain why that was installed already. And then there's the Burlington office center sign on the other side of the building. I can take any questions that you may have at this time. I'm not sure whose hands up was first. Grace, since this is your last meeting, I'll defer to you. Does the ordinance allow for additional signage? Like for a property on the corner like that? Does it take that into account? Okay. And then, if I'm understanding right, the square footage is for all signs on the site. It doesn't distinguish by type of sign? That's correct, Dave. So this picture here that you've got on the screen, there are all these bank of Michigan signs in the window, kind of in the lower right of that lower photo. Do those count? No, the window signage does not. As long as they don't take up more than 25% of the window area, then it doesn't count against them. Okay. And then the Burlington office center sign, is that counted as part of their signage? Total signage? Yes. So what was the signage count on that? Because I don't. I didn't remember seeing that in the 22 sqft. Okay, thank you. Any other questions? I have several. So the applicant is the owner of the entire building, right. Or is. The only applicant tonight is Mister Johnson, who's representing the sign company. Okay, I'm sorry, but. So the property owner, Jim Johnson, is the agent of the property owner. What I'm asking is the property owner the one who owns the entire office building or just bank Michigan? Burlington center owns the building. Okay, so they have control over all the signs? Yes, they have control over the whole building. Okay. That was a big problem because they just want to address the bank Michigan sign. And I was thinking, do you cram the bank Michigan sign because you have three other signs that are over, but the property owner controls all the signs? All right, well, that makes it much easier. Yeah. I mean, they have the ability to comply with the ordinance and adjust all the signs in the building where if it were just bank Michigan, they'd have to come in with just the leftovers. But this is the proper. The owner of the entire building. So they can do whatever they want with the signs and squeeze them down to comply with the ordinance. Right. Well, or they can just leave the existing conditions. Or just leave them. Right. Or they can make adjustments to the freestanding sign or the other signs. Yeah, they have options, but yeah, if we turned it down, there'd be some pressure to make all the other signs conform to the new ordinance. Right. Dharma? So the issue is really about the number of signs already equaling up to the maximum. Exceeding. Exceeding the maximum. Correct. And now they want to add another yes. Okay. Which is just adding onto the. Increasing the nonconformity. Okay. We may have control over all the signs. Yeah. I don't want to speak for the building. No, no, I understand. I came in, I was thinking it's a heck of a problem because the poor bank of Michigan is going to get stuffed. But no, I mean, the owner of the building has the power to do whatever with the signs. I mean, there may be. And the commercial leases run 70, 90 pages, so it may be a lease problem, but. Okay. All right. Any other questions? So, for John, when did the ordinance change? 2019. Okay. Sorry if I missed that in your presentation. Okay. Okay. All right. Guess with that, we're ready to hear from the applicant, or the applicant's agent, in this case. Thank you. You're signing in.

And I will point out it is the only signage proposed to be on. It would be on the main street side of the building, has a significant perimeter to it. This signage is supported by the landlord, Mister Jeff Hoffman, and his company, Oxford companies. And I believe there was a letter in the package for it. And I'm respectfully requesting expansion of the existing nonconforming status to be able to put our signs up on our headquarters building so the window clings will come off as part of that. The existing metal box sign that is over the entrance, you had a picture of it, John, in your presentation. We inherited that when we took over the lease from the U of M Credit Union, which had exited the building, exited that location when they moved to South State street with their new facility south of the MAVd development. So you did a face change? We just put a new sign in there. Yeah, the same cabinet? Same cabinet. So we're looking to replace that with what we call our icon, which is the b in the state of Michigan, the BMesh, and then put our full logo at the top. I'm not well versed in the rules and the history of the zoning requirements for signage, but I do understand that the building is currently nonconforming. And so I view this consideration as an expansion of the nonconforming. And does this present an onerous or an eyesore. Onerous issue for the city or an eyesore for the people or residents in the area? Which, of course, we don't think it does the way we've structured it. Mister Grant, you talked about the landlord trying to make the landlord conform. What I can tell you about the other signs and our sign is included. Those are contained in lease agreements with each tenant. And so there's an underlying financial contract where consideration is paid by the tenants to the landlord for that signage. So for the city to come and say you now have to conform, that would be a significant financial hardship for the tenants and the landlord, as well as probably create some issues, some legal issues around that. I'm not surprised. I'm a retired attorney. That doesn't surprise me. Yeah. So that's what I can tell you about that. What else can I answer for you? I have some questions, but anybody else? Is the signs of Bank Michigan, are they the same square footage as the University of Michigan credit union signs were? You know, I cannot answer that. I don't recall what the U of M credit union had on the building when they were there. Okay. And obviously you said you represent the bank. You don't have anything to do with the other tenants. Their signs, their intents are, you know. Right. Right. Understand? Yes. Okay. And I neglected to introduce Tara Charles as part of our bank team. She's the project manager on this. And Jason Sestak is here from Johnson signs, and they can help answer any questions that you might have. Just to clarify. So the signage is only going to be on the long face along the main street. No signs on any of the other sides of the building? Correct. Okay. All right, good. That's helpful. All right, I've got some questions for staff, not for the staff. I think we're done, sir. Thank you. Thank you, mister Northrop. So am I up for questions? So, John. Yeah. Our sign ordinance is a set amount of signage per building, and it doesn't matter what the square footage of the surface area that's presented to the street. So it's not like a percentage of surface area, it's just a flat number per building, no matter how large the building is or how much surface might be along presenting itself along a street. Is that the way our sign ordinance is written? It's based on building frontage with a maximum of 200 sqft. So if you had a 150 square foot of 150 linear feet of building frontage, you would get 200 sqft, not 300. And if you have 50 linear feet, you'd get 100. So we capped it at 200 in 2019. So, on a building like this, the building frontage is on multiple sides. Two sides. South Main and Eisenhower. Correct. And they have more than. They probably have 300, plus 300 linear feet of frontage, which, by our formula would be more, would allow for more signage. Except we capped it at 200. That's correct. I don't understand the rationale for that. I guess the policymakers dove into this when they crafted this, but to me, it doesn't sound like justice is being done if they chop the building in half. Half. Right. If these were two buildings, then they could get more signage, right. Each building would get their own mount, but it would be two separate buildings, not one. Right. Well, there's an idea that's not a realistic idea for Oxford companies to do that. I don't know. I have a lot of difficulty, and I want to say for the. I've been grappling personally with our sign ordinances, and we're seeing more and more sign variance requests come to us.

And I have a lot of difficulty with how we deal with these, so I'll leave it open for other people to discuss. I don't know where I'm coming down on this. Well, speaking of on high, our city council representative, Darma, you have your hand up. Let me just say first, this was before my time. So indeed, I was trying to look up what the rationale was for the changes to the sign ordinance, and John helped me out by understanding, you know, that the rationale was to reduce the amount of signage. There was too much signage in general. So, given that that was the rationale, I'm thinking of it in that way. But I guess what I'm wondering is, what would be their options for compliance for this particular place, would it be to have no sign? If we're just looking at this in isolation at this one tenant or the whole building? At this one tenant case that's coming forward to us, yeah. So if the variance isn't granted tonight, they wouldn't get a sign. Zero sign. That's correct. Okay, thanks. They could keep the one over the door. No. So that was not permitted or approved, so. I see. Yeah. All right. I'm sorry. Thank you. I was going to say. Right, right. I de organized my files here a little better. Candace has it down. Anybody else in the audience that wants to speak on this? All right, any callers? Remote callers and letters and emails? No. Okay, well, we are in discussion. Dave, I have a lot I want to say about this, but my birthday is tomorrow and I'm ready to celebrate, as you can tell by the shirt I'm wearing. So I'm not going to go into too much depth. We're presented again by the policymakers on high with a motion and variance worksheet, which is basically crafted on granting variances for development or for additions in residential or in. On lots. And these are standards that they ask us to say we have to meet in order to grant these variances, but they're totally irrelevant. And I say once again, for about the 15th time, asking the planning department to come forward with a different group of metrics, a set of criteria that we can judge these by, because this is totally inadequate. There's just no way to comply with this set, to grant a variance like this. If we. Because it can't, it's impossible to meet. So to respond to that, Dave, text them. Amendments take a while. So we're working on Grace's tax amendment right now. That's in the process. So these are, these are things that have to be crafted, drawn up. Go to OrC, go to planning commission, city council, so they take some time. And so I've brought this up to the planning department already. What are your concerns about that? I guess I have to lobby my council person. I have conveyed all of your concerns about this, the five criteria for this, to know that we're as volunteers giving our time to the city to enforce its policies. We're in a hard place, and I'd like justice to be done in this case, and I just don't know how to do it. And I'd look to other board members to help me out. I think I can help. Mike, do you have your hand up? We haven't heard from you tonight. Yeah, I mean, it's pretty easy for me vote yes to do some justice here. Where this building's located right by Briarwood is not right on the edge of a bunch of homes. All these buildings look the same over there. It's really hard to find businesses without good signage because you can't say, go to the look for that building that's red brick. I mean, it's right. Driving through this area, the signage is really critical. These don't look like unreasonably big signs. They're not, you know, across the street from a bunch of houses. I'm gonna vote yes on this. I have a few comments too. I agree with Mike. I think that we're somewhat constrained here. And Mister Northrop, not to my surprise at all, that in the very detailed commercial leases, there would be explicit things about how large and the shape the sign would be. And that's part of the consideration. And secondly, the bank needs a sign. We've been a little hard on some of the hotel. There was a hotel in Briarwood where it's clear today with travelers. Most people don't find a hotel by driving around looking at a hotel as the sun's going down. You find it online and you just need a little sign. As one of the hotels in Briarwood Circle has to identify which of the hotels is the right one. But that's not the case here. And I think to say it the other way, all businesses. What all businesses would want in the perfect world would be an enormous sign with spotlights that would blare loudly, music so you would know where to go for their stuff. But of course, you can't really have that. In contrast, these signs, I think, are very tasteful. It's nice to see the mitten. But the bottom line is the bank needs a sign and we can't deny them a sign. I don't think that that would be right. So I feel. I think that I have to vote yes on this. That would be the correct thing to do. Any other comments? Dharma? Just have to take the bait. I actually feel like in this case, this worksheet is helpful because it talks about.

Is the practical difficulty exceptional to the property in conditions that don't exist elsewhere? Yeah, I think that they're within a context that they can't really control. With respect to the signage already on the buildings, the difficulty which will result from the failure to grant the variance includes substantially more than mere inconvenience. Yeah, they won't have a sign. Period. Allowing the variance will result in substantial justice being done. Especially considering the practical difficulties. Again, I think it meets that criteria. And it's not a self imposed practical difficulty. It's not and shall be the minimum that will make possible reasonable use of the lander structure. I guess goes into whether we think that, you know, the sign is bigger than it needs to be. So I actually don't think that this is that far off for this particular instance. Thank you, Dharma. You convinced me. You convinced me. So we're gonna put that issue to rest for the time being. I'm ready to make a motion. I think with that, we're ready for a motion of 305 East Eisenhower Parkway. ZBA 240-01-9305 East Eisenhower Parkway. In accordance with the established standards for approval. The zoning board of Appeals hereby grants an 85 square foot variance. From section 5.24.5 subsection B permanent signs to allow for two new wall signs to the existing nonconforming building. The signs are to be installed per the submitted plans support. Okay. Thank you, Christina. Grace? Yes. I vote yes. Christina? Yes. Dave Devardi. Yes. Mike? Yes. Julie? Yes. And Dharma? Yes. The application has passed seven to zero. Thank you. Good luck. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you for your time and attention. Thank you. Next petition before us this evening is ZBA 24 0020. Address is 3501 South State Street. Northern Sign Company representing the business and property owners is seeking a variance from table 5.243. Other mixed use and non residential and special purpose district permanent signs. The variance request of 21ft would allow a permanent wall sign to be installed above the maximum allowable height of 20ft. The property is zoned tc one transit corridor district. The subject property is located at the intersection of South State street in Victors Way north of Interstate I 94. The building was built in 2003 and is a hotel use. The applicants will be removing the existing Comfort inn and suite sign package and be replacing that with a Sparks hotel by Hilton sign package. Two existing wall signs are to be removed and the applicants are requested to replace with wall signs that will exceed the maximum allowable wall sign height of 20ft. The proposed wall sign heights are 41ft for the south and west elevations of the building. If you'll turn your attention to the monitors, you'll see the first slide is the zoning map and the subject property highlighted in blueish green in the center of your screen. And the next slide is the aerial photo showing the subject property existing conditions, surrounding areas as well. And like I said, it's dressed right here at the south interstate, south state and I 94. The next slide shows the zoomed in aerial photo of the subject hotel property and the configuration of the parcel. Next slide was submitted by the applicant and showing the different signs and what they want to do. And the variances are for the number two wall sign and number one wall sign. We'll see that right here. So the code says if the building is less than 45ft in height you can't exceed 20ft in height. This building actually happens to be 43ft tall to the top of that peak. That gable is 43ft and so it's less than 45. So these signs will have to be installed at 20ft. Applicant is seeking a variance to have them. As you can see at 41ft that's existing on the left and the proposed on the right. Next slide is just part of their sign package that was submitted. They're going to change out the entrance sign. This is out by the south state entrance. You see the proposed changes which aren't part of this variance. It's just part of the sign package overall. And this existing wall logo is going to be removed and not replaced. And next slide you can see where this one will be. This logo is going to be removed and then that will be removed as well. And they want to replace it with this sign to be installed up here above the 20 foot height requirement. Limit requirement. These are the photos I took when I made my inspection. And you see the signs. This is facing south towards 94. Sorry, having technical difficulties but that was the end of my presentation anyway. That was the end of the signs. So I will take any questions that you may have at this time. Questions, Mike. So John, you said the building's 43ft 45ft or taller, but this building's 43ft, correct? Yes. If it were 2ft taller, how high could the sign be? It could be within the top 15ft of the building or within 3ft of the top. Within 3ft of touch. I'll read that section of code. It's a little confusing.

That was the end of the signs. So I will take any questions that you may have at this time. Questions, Mike. So John, you said the building's 43ft 45ft or taller, but this building's 43ft, correct? Yes. If it were 2ft taller, how high could the sign be? It could be within the top 15ft of the building or within 3ft of the top. Within 3ft of touch. I'll read that section of code. It's a little confusing. So on this wall size it says the placement must be within the lowest 20ft of the building. If the building height is 45ft or higher, it may. Or if the building height is 45ft or higher, it may be placed within the uppermost 15ft of the building and may extend up to 3ft above the top of the building. Above the top of the building. Like it can stick out above the top of the building if it wanted to? Yes. But since this building is 2ft shorter at 43 and not 45 and that's the. That's these gables, that was my next question. So do you measure because you've got the three stories right here in the picture. That would be probably 30 and some change. And then you get this gable. That takes it up to 43. But it still doesn't hit the 45 mark. The dharma. So if they were to put these signs. I mean, where there is no alternative for them to put these signs. Correct. I mean. Well, on one of them there is. Well. Cause 20ft would be about halfway down the building. This one. They could put it down. They can put it here. Got it. Okay, thanks. Is that the main entrance? Yes, right there. The main entrance, yeah. So, so, yeah. And I did discuss that with the applicant. I said, you know, what are the options? And that would be to install one of them right here on the main entrance. And the other. The last picture you showed was facing I 94 in the south side. Yes. Which is the back. That's not the side that's going to be visible first. Yeah, that's. That last photo that I showed you is right here. That's that gable right there. And there's 94. And then the other one is the entrance is right here. So thinking like an attorney, Mike, you probably have the same thought that if they added 2ft to the building on top of the gable, they could have a much bigger sign. Not a much bigger sign, but I mean a higher sign and it could stick up above the other 2ft. It wouldn't be if they, you know. Yes. That's kind of a false facade. That's not really part of the building, but it's a feature that takes it up to that 43. The rest of the building is 30 and some change. But if they add 2ft to the feature, as you call it, they would be able to. Then they wouldn't come to visit. Then they wouldn't be here tonight and they could just install it. Right, right. Okay. All right. Okay. Basically what they wanted to do is just to replace the existing packaging and put it back to where it was. Right. Grace, could you have a building that's 45ft in this district? Yes. Yeah. This is tc one. So like by principle, another building next would have a sign that's that high up. That's correct. Okay. It's the magic number. Once you go over 45ft in the building height. And that's why that last building, if you notice on those elevations, that building was 48ft tall. That's why the other sign didn't need a variance because it could be up top. Building is 48ft. This town has the weirdest orbit. So there is. So there is a. There is a hot starting shot. So in Briarwood, I can't think of the name offhand, but as you go around Briarwood, the hotel that's nearest south State street has a very little sign in Kensington. Kensington? Right. That's the only sign they have, the little one. Right. I know they have a free standing sign, but I don't know about the rest of the cabbage. I think they have another wall sign. Well, I think it was the Hilton that wanted to redo the sign to correspond with the national. Whatever the people in New York City thought that ought to be around the country. And, you know, our comments, mine and others as well, is one, people don't find hotels by driving around. And if Kinsey could get away with a little sign that they're not unoccupied, occupied, what's the problem? So. But anyway, that's sort of my thinking at this point. Happy to make my same argument when we get to our discussion that I made last time. That did not. It'll be in today. Any more questions for John? Okay, I think we're ready to hear from the applicant. Good. Your name, sir? Joel Yonl, appearing on behalf of the applicant and the owner of the property. And I'm here over 2ft. The owner of the property, Wolverine Superior Hospitality Inc. Started negotiating with Spark by Hilton to rebrand its Comfort Inn suites because its license was at its term in July of 2023. Thereafter, franchise agreements were signed. They commenced improvements and that are required to rebrand, such as planning, architecture, drawings. And one of the last steps usually is signage. And they come to this point and they find out there's a height issue of 2ft. So here we are today. And as you know, they're requesting a height variance as part of that, the new package, they are reducing the signs. The channel letter is being reduced. They're removing certain logo like you see there on the port a and on the other architectural feature. This building was built with architectural features for signs. If you look at it, all of the hotels that I've seen, barring the Kensington or whatever it was called, have their signage is always abov", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Wolverine Superior Hospitality Inc.", "insights": [{"observation": "Started negotiating with Spark by Hilton to rebrand its Comfort Inn suites because its license was at its term in July of 2023.

They're removing certain logo like you see there on the port a and on the other architectural feature. This building was built with architectural features for signs. If you look at it, all of the hotels that I've seen, barring the Kensington or whatever it was called, have their signage is always above the. The highest floor of rooms. I think that's by design. I don't know if it's for guests, for visibility. I know you mentioned everyone uses gps. That's true. However, when I use gps, as soon as I get close to my destination, I'm looking for a sign. I want to know where to turn in. I want to avoid having a look, having a, you know, I don't want to hit cars. I don't want to hit people. I'm very focused on where's that sign? I'm coming up 700ft, 400ft, 300ft. I don't want to make that mistake. So I do use gps, but I still look for the signage. This building was built in 2003, fully permitted. So it's my understanding at the time those signs were permitted. I don't know when the signage ordinance changed and neither does my client. Obviously, some of the factors to consider are the practical difficulties and exceptional peculiarities to the property and to the person requesting this variance. This property actually sits below the off ramp from the highway and below State street. Just want you to take that into consideration. Also, the guests who come to this hotel are typically from out of the area. They're not as familiar or they don't grow accustomed to where the location is, such as if you were to go to a coffee shop on a regular basis. Regarding replacing the signage on the south side, there's no practical place to replace that signage on the west side. It was mentioned the porta cache. Studies have not been done to determine whether the porticoche can support a sign, how you get power to it, and other factors. So that study has not been done yet and the cost of it, if need be, as insinuated here. Is it possible maybe they increase the height of the building and then they don't have to come before the ZBA? Regarding justice being done, again, I'm going to state this is over 2ft. In that same area, there are hotels that are less than 45ft that have signs in excess of two stories of 20ft. The red Roof Inn next door, their signage is in an excess of 20ft. The extended stay America, its signage is in excess of three stories. I don't know the exact height of that building, but looking on it on Google Maps, it's probably the same height. It's a three story building. In addition, all of the hotels in that area, except for maybe one, have signs that are same location on the top above all their stories. So, for instance, Hyatt Place is in excess of six stories. Even hotels is an excess of four stories. Fairfield Inn, excess of five stories. Holiday Inn is an excess of five stories. Sheraton is an excessive six stories. Courtyard, excessive four stories. Hampton, excessive four stories. Again, these heights are by design, by the signage ordinance, which essentially penalizes a smaller height building compared to a larger height building. Even though they're in the same industry and they're attracting the same clientele, the conditions and circumstances here are not self imposed. My client owned this building built it pursuant to building permits and now finds out I can't merely replace my sign. My timer. A couple more points. Sure. The only thing I guess I want to add with the limited time I have left is the current height of the signage does not diminish, but I think it increases safety for both vehicles and pedestrians because, like I said, people will be able to identify that hotel sooner and again, the sign is not a nuisance sign. It's a very attractive sign. Hilton is actually an upgrade from Comfort Inn and suites, which is a choice branded hotels. And I would. I'm here to answer any questions. Questions. I have an offbeat question. Why are they changing their name to Spark? I mean, that conflicts with. We have, like, a commercial development organization that works with bringing industries to the community and to the state that goes by the Ann Arbor Spark. When I saw this, I said, oh, Ann Arbor Spark is moving. That's above my pay grade. That's a Hilton question. All I know, based on my industry and based now in my experience, is Hilton is a much better brand than choice. And I think it's an asset, and it's wonderful to have. I was just throwing that question out there. So, Mister Yono, you've made a number of excellent points. You, well stated, made a number of excellent points. Picking up on Dave's question, you know, I have a Hilton and a Holiday Inn. My wife has Marriott, but there are so darn many hotel chain names. Just like, thinking when we were a kid. Wood. And there are 40 different toothpastes. No, they're all proctor and gamble. So Hilton has Hilton, Doubletree, Embassy Suites, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton, which I like, homewood, and now spark. I have no idea what the differences are. Talk about brand mushiness. You just put them all into a blender. It's insane. I don't get it. It has nothing to do with what we're doing today, but another Hilton name. It's insane. We're getting a little on the weeds. I know.

That is the main side of the building as you come into Briarwood. Is that correct? Is that parking lot? Okay, thank you. That's correct. I did want to mention the franchise agreement. So that's one thing. Yeah, I know you. So we do have a franchise agreement which requires signage in certain places. So a denial of this could put us potentially in a liability issue. Again, that's above my head with Hilton. Right. Understood. Okay. And then I can answer your question on the numerous brands if you want my opinion. No, that's okay. No. It'll just give you what little part is left. And an old brain will just confuse me even more. It's actually really simple. Okay. Any other questions for Mister Yodel? All right. Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time. I really appreciate it. Happy birthday, David. Thank you very much. All right. Anybody? No, there is nobody else in the audience. That makes that easy. Any remote callers? Okay. Any letters or emails? No? Okay. We're left. Okay. On our own. All right. We are in discussion. Grace, I feel like the request makes sense. And I appreciate that overall. That with the rebranding that the signage is being reduced. And I would rather see the sign there in this location. Where the building is kind of designed for it to be. Then the building be changed to be 2ft higher. Personally, I think it would look a lot weirder if that was the case. Okay. Anybody else? Dave? You're smiling, Mike. Well, I was going to say we need the hotel rooms. So I'm going to hold out till I put an extra floor on this. That's a joke. I'm in my birthday mode already. I don't see any reason to deny this. Okay. For the same reasons that Dharma articulated on the previous motion. That was similar. Okay. I mean, I think it has. It does comply with several of our determination metrics. Any other discussion? All right, I think we're ready for a motion. ZBA 240-020-3501 South State street. Based on the following findings. In accordance with the established standards for. Actually, let me cross that out. In accordance with the established standards for approval. The zoning board of Appeals hereby grants a 20 1ft variance from table 5.243. To allow two wall signs to be installed at a height of 41ft. Where the maximum height is 20ft. The signs are to be installed per the submitted plans support. Great. All right. Voting. Dharma? Yes. Julie? Yes. Mike? Yes. Grace? Yes. I vote yes. Dave Davard? Yes. And Christina? Yes. Your application is passed, sir. Seven to zero. Thank you very much. Good. Any unfinished business? I don't have any. If anyone else does. No one's brought anything to my attention. Okay. New business other than member that's already been mentioned a couple times. Yes. Yes. Welcome back. And Dave, thanks again to grace. One new coming, one leading. All right. All right. And now possible reports from Goingson at the city council. Dharma, we just passed our budget. And including in that budget was some additional resources for John. As well as the planning department because we know we have the comprehensive plan as well as a bunch of important UDC changes that are coming up at the request of council. So we switched out the suggestion for a junior person. We lost some people to retirement over the past year with a more senior person and as well as some consulting money. So I think that's the big news. Thank you. Any other communications? I haven't received any. I don't know of any. All right. Anybody remotely that wants to comment in general on something else not covered so far, no. All right, I guess we're ready for a motion to adjourn. I move for adjournment. Okay. Second all right. All in favor? Aye. All right, we're adjourned. Correct. David. Announcement tonight. And I've got a friend of mine who's outta.

The ordinance provisions committee met on April 23 and discussed a petition that's been submitted to for five amendments to the TC one zoning district, which include things like curb cuts, modifying allowable building dimensions for larger sites, exceptions to minimum building frontage requirements, exceptions for use, specific standards for parking structures, and clarifying how we define a block. So we discussed those. There's no action taken in the revisions committee meetings, but those will be coming to the full commission at selling point. May 23. May 23.

Thank you. Thank you. Do other commissioners have anything to report? Quick update on the transportation commission. We met on April 18, so it was a little while ago now, but we just reviewed budget, the act 51 funding allocation, that's the gasoline tax, just something to be aware of. It's kind of starting to plateau in terms of act 51 revenue. Sidewalk construction millage looking at the main street, upgrade the sidewalk from in Arbor, Salina Stadium climate action millage is going towards crosswalk streetlights and bike lane upgrades. It's about $700,000. Other ones we talked about serious crash responses and some of the improvements that we're seeing around town. So just the East Medical center drive construction is going until the end of 2024, and I think the one MDOT has indicated a willingness to add non motorized connections across us 23, but that's still kind of underway as far as discussions and then the state and hill improvements. They did say that constructions are intended to be completed by August, so we'll see if that happens. But just wanted to give everybody a heads up.

But back some time ago when you removed the far premium incentives for the downtown, I suggested that you revisit the exceptions, which, if you remember, allow a downtown building to build 30% higher if they do one of two things meet the definition of affordable housing or sustainability. Affordable housing definition, I believe, was 15% of units at 60%. AMI sustainability was solar panels covering 60% of the roof area or electrification ready, which is defined as basically some electrical panels and conduit. And I argued then that given that we've removed, we've allowed far basically any kind of bulk at this point without needing any incentives that we should tighten up the incentives on the exception side, especially on the sustainability definition, which my worst nightmare was that some building, massive building, was going to come in and claim 30% higher height while calling itself electrification ready but burning gas for heat. And that has just happened. This hasn't reached you yet, but there's a building at 621 church that hasn't formally submitted a plan yet, but they're going in front of the design review board next this month, I think 19 stories, over 200 units kind of COVID an entire city block, you know, really big building. And they're going, they're going to be 195ft high, which is 45ft higher than 150 foot height limit for d one. And they're saying they're doing this for sustainability reasons. And so they're putting some solar panels on the roof. They'll only serve a fraction of the building's electrical needs and not electrifying the building. They're calling it electrification ready. And so what we have here is a building that's going to be taking advantage of our sustainability incentive and we'll be burning gas throughout this massive building, which seems to me that the incentive for sustainability is a failure here. You may argue that, well, we want to go higher anyway. Heard that a lot last night at city council from a lot of the public. But to the extent that you intend buildings to be relatively decarbonized, the definition for height exception in the UDC really isn't working. And we're seeing the first example of it now. And you'll see this building at some point come before you. So I don't know if it's too late to change that definition. I would argue that building should be both affordable housing and sustainable and that we should ask for electrification at the time of construction. That's what I said last time. I don't know if it would be a breach of faith at this point. Now the developers move forward. I think my time is up. Right. Sorry I said it up. Thank you. Mister Garber. Do we have any other public comments? I'm going to actually, before we get to the remote participants, apparently they cannot hear us on Zoom right now. So I would like to call for a quick three minute recess to restart and then we will resume public hearing. So give us folks can hear on the CCN broadcast, but I just need to check that everything is as it's supposed to be because we got some feedback. So just give us a few minutes. Yes, we'll reconvene at 717. Thank you. I missed it earlier where the outlets are down here. I'm going to call us back to session. That was my gavel. We're back to public comments. Is there anyone else here in person that would like to speak at this public comment? Seeing no one, we're going to move on to remote participants phone number ending in nine five, five. You have permission to address planning commission. You will need to unmute. Please hold for technical difficulties. Can you remember that? Yes, we can. Great. Can I have a comment on the work plan or is there. There will be a public hearing on that. There will not be a public hearing on that. I think this will. Great. Okay, so. Kirkwood, 35 of my charter, please. I sent you an email. I'm sure if you're able to read it, but I was remarking on the work plan. I got the sound. Basically, it looks like you have a really busy agenda tonight, and I know the work plan is coming last. I prefer if you are prepared to amend it and approve it tonight. That's great. If there may be things that you all aspire to accomplish, accomplish this year in parallel with the conference going on, and they don't have to be on a work plan and you don't have amendments prepared, I would just ask that you postpone it and give back some thought as well as I hope you can get back into that proposed amendment and consideration as well. That's all I got. But good luck tonight and thanks for taking my call. Thank you, Mister Westall. Our next caller is. Phone number ending in 194.

With that, we're going to go on to section eight a, which is unfinished business. There are none. So with that, we go to regular business. This is 1601 South State Street. South Town Rezoning is the author to amend the conditional zoning statement of conditions. This is the petition to amend the Southtown zoning statement of conditions adopted and incorporated by ordinance number 23 24 to zone a 1.66 acre site. C one AR campus business residential district with conditions by restating paragraph 2d from the property. Shell have no natural gas connections except for purchasing backup power to the property. Will demonstrate continuous micro grid operations at 60% to 75% less carbon intensity than the electricity. Incumbent DTE staff recommendation is approval and with that we will head on to petitioner presentation. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you. I'm doctor Margaret Posher and I am the developer. And we are, as you said, requesting a restatement of conditions so that we can provide the city with a much more sustainable project. And with that, I will turn it over to my right hand and energy expert, Heidi Posher. Heidi, great. Thank you very much. Let's see. Help me, Hank. Not working. 2 seconds. Okay, so the first thing I want to talk about is just what is this microgrid? So the microgrid is a computer controlled system that is actually housed inside of the not only the south town footprint, but the south town building. It will involve fuel cells that run on renewable natural gas, solar battery storage, a geothermal system and a vehicle to grid charging system. All of those, what we call generation assets or storage assets, will be monitored by a micro grid controller. It'll have twenty four seven real time insight into what's happening with the assets and we will configure various programs in terms of what our outcome objectives are. Most of those will relate to sustainability or reliability. They'll integrate with the building system. The building management system runs all of the mechanical operations. So the H Vac, the lighting system. And the purpose of this integration is to optimize the overall operation to be as sustainable as possible, but also to allow for shelter in place. We're going to have 221 units at south town, so probably about 400 residents and 54 parking spots. And what that means is, is that there's going to be an awful lot of people that bike or walk as the, as city wants and as we want. But when it comes to bad weather or extreme conditions, we don't feel like giving them any other option other than sheltering in place is good as a property owner. So we want to allow for fully energized shelter in place. We want to. Our objective is to maintain a carbon negative operation. So not just do better than, but to actually kind of set a new bar in terms of operation. And then lastly, to establish, to maintain energy economy for south town residents. We're very aware, based on our experience and our ongoing research and involvement in the energy industry, that retail utility rates are going to do nothing but increase. And we actually think we have a solution here to manage those to a great degree. And that's important to us as well. Can you do the next slide, Hank? Yeah. Can you actually see if it works again?

So not just do better than, but to actually kind of set a new bar in terms of operation. And then lastly, to establish, to maintain energy economy for south town residents. We're very aware, based on our experience and our ongoing research and involvement in the energy industry, that retail utility rates are going to do nothing but increase. And we actually think we have a solution here to manage those to a great degree. And that's important to us as well. Can you do the next slide, Hank? Yeah. Can you actually see if it works again? Yeah. Okay. There we go. Thanks. So what's the language in the zoning modification? What we're committing to is to establish performance versus what the incumbent electricity provider, DTE, does. And we're also referring to that as business as usual. So most of the residents in Ann Arbor get their utility service, whether it's gas or electric, through DTE. And so that's the, that's a bar that we're evaluating our own performance against. We'll basically be coordinating all of the assets that I talked about that are included in the microgrid. But one of the assets that relates specifically to this request are fuel cells that we'll have on site. The fuel cells will be powered by renewable natural gas, which we're going to get directly through contracting with farming operators. And I'm going to talk in the next slide about what that looks like specifically. But the outcomes that we're trying to support are carbon intensity reduction. So by our measurement, we think that we can actually reduce the amount of CO2 or greenhouse gas that's put out into the environment by about 7000 metric tons, which is over on a year over year basis, which is pretty substantial. We also think that we'll be able to lower on site electricity, electricity costs, especially as electricity rates increase for typical electricity clients, the greenhouse gas. And what happens with that is a big question, and we know we have to not only answer that question now, but provide information about how we're doing that. Performance objective. When the chemical process that the fuel cell uses to take gas and breaks it down into water, hydrogen, and CO2, there will be no combustion on site. And we'll also have CO2 collection units that will basically capture that and allow us to sell it to another user. We can also sequester it, but the CO2 will be completely captured by the fuel cell. One thing that's really important to note is this is a transitional plan. Obviously, our objective would be to use either even more sustainable, more renewable fuel, a synthetic fuel, with the oil companies are calling a molecular fuel to fuel these fuel cells. And an important thing to know about this as we make this transition is that the fuel cells themselves stay in place. The filters are typically changed periodically. So every five to seven years, those filters get changed. And the chemistry inside the filters is basically customized to whatever the fuel source is. So if we, for example, went from renewable natural gas to hydrogen, there would be different chemistry inside the filters, but we would use the same fuel cells. So it's not going to be any kind of onerous cost to us to change to an even greener fuel when those become available. And I think it's important to remember, because this really will help us hit all three of our objectives, which are sustainability, resilience, and lower cost overall. All right, let's talk about cows and the manure. How do we make this renewable fuel? Well, first of all, manure is collected from dairy farmers, and it's put into digesters, and the digesters keep all of that gas from going out into the atmosphere. The anaerobic process that collects that gas creates 45% to 65% pure methane as an outcome of that process. I only have three minutes left out of ten. Wow. Okay. It also creates water, fertilizer, and bedding. So the gas goes through its own filtering as part of that digestion system. It gets injected into the fuel system. The gas is purified. From there, they take out all the noxious gases, and they increase it to a greater methane content, which is about 90% pure. So why is this renewable? Well, it absorbs more greenhouse gas than it emits, and it also keeps, it prevents the manure from expressing greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. A couple interesting numbers. Renewable natural gas, negative 90 carbon score. Solar 18 positive 18 carbon intensity score. Regular natural gas 16 carbon intensity score. So this is quite a bit lower. This is what it looks like it goes into. When it comes to it goes through the fuel cell, comes in as pure, almost pure methane. It mixes with oxygen, and like I said, it creates electricity, water, hydrogen, carbon dioxide. That carbon dioxide is captured on site and it's either sold to a third party or it can be sequestered. Really important chart here. The blue line, just below 60, is what almost, almost everyone in Ann Arbor is performing at in terms of the electricity they buy from DTE. The orange line is what DTE says it's going to do. The Green line would be our fuel cell if we were operating on landfill gas. The blue line is landfill gas plus carbon capture. And the purple line, that's less than zero is if we use renewable natural gas and caption carbon, which is what we actually intend to do. I'm just going to zip through to this slide because I'm sure we're going to do some more talking later. I think I have liberty to extend the time. Great, because I really set up there. Yeah, yeah. Now I just went into gil mode. Okay, so on the right hand side, we've got the business as usual, right?

Now I just went into gil mode. Okay, so on the right hand side, we've got the business as usual, right? So if we had built the building to regular 2015 standards and we met that building code and we powered it through DTE's electrical system, and we just met all of the objectives in terms of the code, the mechanical systems, and got DTE electric and put their transformers in our building, we would create about 25.6 metric tons of greenhouse gas per square foot per year. On the left hand side is our approach. And our approach is to do the mass timber construction. So that means off site panel construction. That means use Michigan green electricity as we build. It means use a passive house envelope to the extent that we can without really messing up our geothermal system, because it's a tricky mistress, and you got to make sure you protect that field. So that's our number one objective. We'll use geothermal. We'll use heating and cooling load capacity that runs on heat pumps and chiller loads. To optimize that geothermal system will optimize all of our mechanical systems, whether it's air exchangers, everything that you can do to make a sustainable decision. That's what we've done with design choices around south town. We'll include tenant demand reduction. And as part of the tenant demand reduction, as we create carbon intensity avoided incentives and sell those carbon credits out into the marketplace, will reward our tenants, will reward our tenants for their participation in the program as well. So it'll be very much a holistic environment around conserving energy. So we haven't even gotten to the part until we get to the last square about actually using fuel, whatever's left in terms of the demand of the building. After we take all of those measures, on the left hand side, we'll have a dispatch order that's as green as it possibly can be. So the first dispatch asset is solar, followed by energy that's stored from solar charging. So the dispatch of last resort is using the fuel cell, which, again, will have renewable natural gas from dairy farms and runs at a negative, at a negative carbon intensity, because that fuels just so, so carbon intensive based on the amount of CO2 that it's already captured in the process of either making it or before it actually gets to that digester. When you add up all of that efficiency, number one, you're actually avoiding 31.4 metric tons of greenhouse gas per square foot, as opposed to burning 25. But even more importantly, as a collective, for the entire year, year after year, you are performing at negative 7000 metric tons of greenhouse gas. And that scope one and scope two. So the highest order and the biggest hitter in terms of sustainability, which is, you know, incredibly important. Help me, Hank. Yeah, about 10 seconds remaining, but why don't we extend how long you need, like 30 seconds. Okay, 30 seconds. So, because I know there's going to be a lot of questions, and I'll just answer the rest of it in the questions. As I mentioned, you know, electricity costs are going up because they have to. There's lots of infrastructure that has to be replaced. There's lots of upgrades that have to be made, and there's lots of generation fleets that have to be substantial, substantially upgraded into renewable standards to meet with mandates that are handed down by the government. What we think we'll be able to do is keep our pricing very consistent and we'll be able to keep it much more in control in terms of the overall impact to our customers. So between 2026 and 2040, we forecast that energy bill savings will be more than $400,000 to the tenants of Southtown versus other folks that are paying DTE rates as a function of these increases that are unavoidable accountability measures. We've come up with some language that's going to go into the development agreement, and it basically goes through everything that I said, and it just kind of walks through the process of transitioning between renewable natural gas to whatever the most sustainable objective is, or, I'm sorry, fuel type is for us. We don't know what's going to happen with green carbon or with green hydrogen. We don't know what's going to happen with any other kind of forms of synthetic or molecular gas. I know that there's. With respect to the renewable natural gas, some people have asked the question, well, what if you can't make a contract with dairy farmers? I mean, Missy Stoltz makes a point that there's plenty of feedstock available where that came from. So maybe we'll do a project with the city to do some other form of digestion. The objective, though, is to get below the line of sustainability, and there are many, many reasons to do that. It's an opportunity in terms of sustainability. It's an opportunity for our company as well, in terms of pushing the envelope in terms of creating value. And it doesn't take very long in terms of studying the climate economy to understand how true that is. So it's both an objective in terms of meeting the objectives of the city, but it's also an objective for good business and figuring out ways to take advantage of the climate economy. And that's what I feel like we're doing. So there'll be an annual report. It'll talk about performance. It'll be very data intensive. We'll be collecting all sorts of data anyway.

You know, like, I don't think we need to go through it. These fuel cells are very, very safe. We can have lots of discussion about that. But, you know, they've been in these environments for 200. I'm not 200 years. Those Yankees are really something for the last 20 years in Connecticut. But, you know, there are, like, 800 units operating, and they're monitored 24/7 by this company. So I included some information in there. It's more of a takeaway, but they're incredibly safe. All right, thank you for the extra time. Thank you. Appreciate it. Now we move on to staff presentation. I also want to mention that we have Missy's fault on Zoom. Thank you. As mentioned, this is the 1601 South State street, south town rezoning. It's an offer to amend the conditional zoning statement of conditions. Conditions. In summary, the site is currently zoned c, one ar, with conditions being a, there's a maximum height limit, b a maximum vehicle parking space limit, c a use limitation, and d, elimination on natural gas connections. The proposed zoning is c, one ar with conditions repeating a, b, and c, but d will be a requirement to operate a carbon efficient, continuous microgrid. Staff report in a couple different places lists the exact language that will be swapped out in the conditional zoning statement of conditions. An amendment to change, or an amendment or a change to a conditional zoning statement of conditions. That was. The attorney's office came up with that phrase being adopted and incorporated into chapter 55 of the code, is subject to review and approval procedures of a rezoning petition as if it was c, one arc to pl. The staff report goes into a little bit of some existing conditions and background of the south town project, and linked to the staff report were the other staff reports for the actual Southtown project. Happy to get into them, but I'll skip over them for this moment, I think, as thoroughly mentioned, but it's worth repeating. The current power plan. And what was the basis for rezoning and site plan approval was the project was to be powered using the DTE electrical grid and having an internal combustion generator operated by natural gas just for its emergency backup. The proposed power plan is as just described, but they will power and operate an on site fuel cell to generate its own electricity, hence the term microgrid. There's a little bit of background to help explain what a fuel cell is. I think that's also been well covered. The inside presentation. And so with that, I will say that staff recommend that the offer to amend the conditional zoning statement of conditions is accepted because it meets the intention for a reduced carbon intense building and will result in a project that's both more sustainable and climate friendly than conventional projects, as well as the originally accepted condition. Happy to answer any follow up questions, or I'm sure the brochures are as well. They might be more able to answer technical fuel cell questions. I sure hope so. Otherwise, we're all in trouble. Yeah. Thanks, Alexa. Yes. Oh, I think we go on to public hearing. Thank you. Okay. Thank you for the staff presentation. With that, I just wanted to check if Missy would like to add anything from a staff perspective. Yes. Military opportunity. Apologies. I'll sometimes use a little. Sorry. I am a preacher of the innovation that we're hearing here, and we're just. This is something that is unique as we're thinking about the future of microgriding broadly throughout the city. And so OSI is really kind of leaning in to learn as much as we can from this type of project, whether it was for this iteration or other space. So thanks for the opportunity to be here. Thank you we're now moving on to public hearing. This is an opportunity for persons to speak up to three minutes about this particular item.

Apply actually, if one of our petitioner guests could make room for Mister Gerber to make a public comment. Yes, the microphone is right there. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Lee King Garber again, first of all, I want to point out just how unique this circumstance is. I've been attending planning commissions regularly longer than any of you, with the exception of commissioner Wetherby or commissioner Mills, and you took a long time off. But I have never heard any developer talk about things like carbon accounting or emissions prevented or carbon intensity, much less produce an annual report on all these subjects. And just that fact alone makes this just an exceptional kind of event to me. You know, I need time to absorb the details of the proposal. I really haven't had time to look at the packet materials, but I do have a. I mean, you know, I'm inclined for sure to support the petition to change the. I'm sorry. Yeah, to change the conditions for approval of this project. I wasn't happy about the new natural gas connection, but given the fact that they're removing themselves from DTE electricity and that the natural gas will be used as a last resort, that's acceptable to me. So overall, I know probably their callers will disagree with me, but I think this is really worth digging into and for lessons for other buildings around the city and for possibly standards. The questions I have. I know my time is running out. Carbon capture. I'd love to learn about exactly what technology you're thinking of. I've been reading about low temperature solid sorbent CO2 capture and regeneration. The problem with this and all other carbon capture technologies I've been reading is just they're very energy intensive. 25%. 25% what? Additional load. Additional load. Right. So that's one concern. You're going to need more electricity for that. On the hydrogen side, I was a little concerned by the statement in the staff report that if pure hydrogen can be used to produce electricity, microgrid can be completely carbon free. I assume you're talking about green carbon, not carbon produced from methane using methane cracking or steam reforming. Yeah, I mean that's the only grain there is, right? So, yeah. So your carbon accounting will take into account upstream emissions and methane if you go that route and so forth. Okay. Yeah, those are my questions and those are my comments. I'm really glad I showed up today. Thank you mister. Thank you Mister Garber. Do we have anybody else that would like to speak? The president seeing no one else. Who do we have remotely? Phone number ending in 194. You have permission to address the planning commission. Hello, this is Rita Mitchell calling from the west side of Ann Arbor. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Yes. Okay, good. I'm calling about this project and I agree that the approach is an innovative one and it's great to get away from DTE. At the same time, I have a serious concern about the source of the renewable natural gas with carbat, particularly with the source being agricultural because of the perpetuation of animal factory farm production for that source which is polluting on its own. It's standalone from the methane that will be produced and also that the methane that will produce is methane, whether it's from cows, not fossil. But it is still a greenhouse gap with serious heating potential. And getting it to the site is likely to have the same kind of leak concerns that we have with methane that we would get from DTE. So I'm concerned about that. I'm also concerned about the technical aspects of dealing with the carbon capture and the energy required to produce either blue or green hydrogen. So green hydrogen as I understand it, is produced from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Blue hydrogen is produced from natural gas, what's called natural gas, which is actually once again, so the emissions immediately in this area would be reduced, which is super, but simply so on the root, wherever the hydrogen is produced will have some pollution associated with it, I believe. So. I really like to understand that and I'd like to understand the process of accounting for the performance of the program. So once again, I just want to say great for moving forward. It's something that's innovative and different from GTE. But I think this requires a lot of detail to understand and rely on it and to actually have energy provided to this project that doesn't pollute. Downriver in Lake Erie, where the pollution from our factory farms, at least they're local to our area, relatively local to and ever goes. We get the blue green energy right there and polluting Lake Erie. So that's a worry. Thank you. Thanks for listening. Thank you for your comments. Do we have anybody else?

Adam Goodman, you have permission to address the planning commission for three minutes. Hi, it's Adam Goodman for Henry Virginia Avenue. This is a really interesting presentation and it's an exciting concept. I hope it works out well. And of course, I do think that the profession here is reasonable, should be approved. But really, I would have preferred that these conditions not exist at all. I mean, if this is what the developer wants to do, I'm happy to support it. But I think this notion that we have writing extremely specific conditions into our zoning code to make every rezoning a totally bespoke unique projects that cannot adapt to different realities in the world without having to go entirely through the legislative zoning process. Again, I think that's not the way of approach, broadly speaking for us, that you could be taken when we have a massive scale of the problem with the housing crisis and climate crisis. That's if the original condition about connection to DTE and natural gas had not been written into the zoning, then the developers here could have proceeded with this plan without having to come back to planning commission and city council approval for that. And I. So if this is the approach that everybody wants to take. Fair enough. I went favor. That's all. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Goodman. There are no further hands raised. Mister chair. Okay, we'll give it just one more second. Okay. With that, I will close public comment. I'm going to read the proposed motion for the planning commission. This is the Ann Arbor City Planning Commission hereby recommends that the mayor and city council approve rezoning 1601 South State Street, South Town by accepting the offer to amend the conditional zoning statement of conditions to change from prohibiting natural gas connections except for emergency backup power to demonstrating a continuous microgrid operation at 60% to 75% less carbon intensity than electricity. Incumbent DTE provided in paragraph d two. Moved by Commissioner White. Seconded by councilmember Dish. We are in discussion. Who would like to kick us off? Christian Adams. I just had a question and Alexis, I'm not sure if this is a question for the city attorney. Or not. I'm not sure what procedural posture we're in here because I saw the note from the city attorney in the staff report, and that makes it sound like we're in a. We're in a rezoning, a traditional rezoning petition context where we would have a free hand to take the proposal and make changes to it. But it's being also packaged as an offer, voluntary offer, under the separate section of the Michigan code for voluntary conditions attached to zoning, which we cannot alter or mess with. So I'm wondering if the city attorney provided any color on what latitude we have. I do think I can answer this. So this is a rezoning from c one ar with four very specific conditions. And the original condition conditions are in the packet. And then this is a. An offer to rezone it to c one a r with four conditions. The first three happen to be the same, but the fourth is different. And then that document is also attached in the packet. And, yes, the state statute says that the city of Ann Arbor city council is non legal term allowed to accept conditions. They must be voluntarily offered, and they cannot. They are not negotiated, unlike, say, a plan unit development. You can, in your discussion, make it clear about why you are accepting them or why you are not accepting them, but you can't say, for example, could you make the micro grid be 40% to 60% better? This is a yes or no on the condition that they are offering. But like I said in the discussion, you can tell them if you do not like this offer, you can be clear about why don't like it. They can come back or not. So there is no negotiating with this offer, unlike a plan unit of development. But you can be clear about why you don't accept this offer? Yeah. Does that answer your question? It gets me most of the way there. I'll sharpen the question. Okay. If I wanted to, in two moves, two motions, reject the offer and strike condition 2d completely as a change to the existing zoning, which I am allowed to do. Can I do that in this meeting, or am I. Is that a separate meeting to do the second step? So I think that you cannot strike it. I think that you can say why you are rejecting this offer. That's what I wanted to know. Thanks. Thank you. Commissioner Abrams. Maybe also a question for staff. There was talk of this annual sustainability performance report, but I don't see it mentioned in the conditional zoning statement conditions. So I'm wondering where that would show up. It is not. It is in the draft development agreement, which I did not print. But it is an attachment. Look for the attachment.

They expressed that because this is complex technology and the whole introduction of method, blah, blah, blah, expressed the concern that this project will default to simply going into a traditional agreement to get methane from DPE. Got it. Okay. Right. So complexity will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, first of all, just as a general response to the colleague that was talking about concerns about farming and downstream impacts, it would be hard for me to disagree with that. You know, like the sustainability, digging out of the sustainability, the climate hold that we're in is going to be an extremely complex process. There's no magic bullet to get us out of it. Every comment that she made is a legitimate comment. Let me start with a couple, couple things. So I just want to go back to right now, everybody in Ann Arbor who gets gas from electricity from DTE, where it's not under a special program which is limited by the way. You know, mi green power is limited and you know, they can't cover all of the demand for that. But there is some pretty extreme greenhouse gas being created by typical generation because it's 85% fossil fuel intensive. So what are our options with respect to using that microgrid and health or with respect to the fuel cell, which I think is really the big part of the concern here. It's not the microgrid, it's that last order of dispatch, which is a fuel cell and powering it with gas. So just as a reminder, we've done everything we can to make that slice of demand as small as it possibly can be, which I think is important. So we spent a lot of money to make the extra modifications in terms of the design, putting the geothermal field in, optimizing the pv. And that's not anything other than to say we get it, we get using the gas. It's a tough swallow. Right? Within the context of all of that, what's really important to us as a business is to operate below carbon neutrality to get into the negative. I mean, carbon neutrality is great, but if we can get into the negative, that's even better. And we have, we are financially motivated. We are. I just want to, and I don't want to make a big deal about that, but I want to tell you why, like that last degree really matters. To us, it's a big deal. A way that we can support more sustainable development. So it's not just a notional objective, it's really important. Why does that matter? Because in order to meet our business objectives, we have to be able to honestly account for the same kind of performance that the city of Ann Arbor wants us to account for, which is, show me your math. Exactly how are you coming up with this performance standard? And if we can show zero or less than zero, not only are we meeting our goals with respect to what we've agreed to with the city, which is important to us, but we will have put ourselves on a different track in terms of being participants in the climate economy in ways that will help us to extend more sustainable development, which is what we want to do. There's no way to fake it. You know, if the hydrogen is gray or blue and not green, then it doesn't count. It doesn't get us below that, into that purple where we want to be. You know, we could say, you know, people have asked, didn't come up here in question. People have asked, how do you know you're going to get this dairy contract? I mean, we could, we could use renewable or landfill gas, but it's still, it still doesn't have, it's not as green when you add things up as the dairy natural gas is. So we're all going to have to agree to some sort of calculus around how do I balance, how do I add up the carbon over here and how do I take away the carbon over here? We're all going to have to agree to some system of accounting that moves us forward. And, you know, and I think the caller was actually doing that. She was saying, you know, innovation around these important things should be supported, but we're not going to get to a perfect. But here are my concerns, and I get that those are concerns, but we got to make forward progress somehow. So starting with we can do the math around being green is really important. The greener we get, the better it's going to be for us in terms of meeting our objectives with the city, but also meeting our participation objectives in terms of the carbon economy or the climate economy. So none of that's wrong. But we've got to come up with a least common denominator way of measuring all of this stuff out. Otherwise we're never going to make the transition. We're just going to be stuck. And I don't want to be stuck at 7000 metric tons of greenhouse gas a year at a brand new development that's supposed to be really sustainable. Just gross. I don't know. Does that answer the question or not? Maybe not. No, no, it does. I mean, to my mind, too, yes. I mean, I find it implausible that your development, having a contract with dairy farmers. One dairy farmer is going to perpetuate factory farming. I think that. Of course not. Yeah. So, and you spoke about scope one and two emissions. You're clearly thinking about scope three emissions because you've made this choice of your fuel source, but that doesn't make you responsible.

It does. It does get the manure into the digester and out of the, out of the field. And it does take advantage of what the intent is, which is to start using the waste that we're creating in a circular economy. Thank you, Commissioner Mills. Thanks. This is really exciting and interesting. And so I've got a number of questions, just so I make sure that I'm understanding kind of what we're talking about. It's been mentioned a couple times, clarity. Are you not connecting at all then, to the DT electricity? No, we are not. Okay. So before it was like no gas connection, and now it is only gas connection, no electricity connection, ironically. And then the microgrid is, does that also cover the space conditioning or will that be through. I don't know as much as I ought to know about how fuel cells work. Like, how is space conditioning working? Yeah. So we have an h vac system. We have a mechanical system that brings fresh air in. We have water based heat pumps because we have one geothermal field and possibly two, we might have redundant geothermal fields because we're so concerned about maintaining operations. So all of those devices that are in a typical as green as you can get environment will basically connect to an energy system. That is, whether it's fueled by the PV or whether it's fueled by the storage or whether it's fueled by the fuel cell will provide it electricity. So everything gets converted to electricity on site with no combustion. And then it's, I think, I think your question might be, is it still an all electric environment? Yes, it is more because, like. Right, you can. This is combining now. And what we want to do is try to combine the heating system to something like a common denominator. That. Right. Just to make sure that in the future, when renewable natural gas is not right when it's green hydrogen or, like, whatever. Missy and I might do something crazy and just partner with the wastewater facility. Right. Like, our biggest problem will be the supply chain. How do we get that gas from wastewater to the real estate developments? Wouldn't that be awesome? Yeah. Yeah. I'm curious about the size of the battery than in here. Do you have any sense of, like, the. Like, the physical size? No. We're in megawatts or kilowatts. We're not up to a megawatt yet. No. Okay. It's probably gonna. I have no idea how much to put it all together, but. Okay. Right. So the overall. It's all based on demand. Yeah. So the overall demand of the entire. The entire 226,000 estate development is about 960 kw. Okay. Which is just a megawatt. Almost. A megawatt. Almost. So we'll actually have. And the architects are here, and I should never jump in and talk about stuff that I'm not an expert in. They definitely can answer these questions better, but it looks like we're going to have two battery components that are going to be about 250 kw each. And then we'll have pv, obviously, and then we'll have. And the only limitation to the BV, other than what we're planning on right now, is we're going to have three fuel cells, and those fuel cells have to. We're going to do a lot with the waste heat. And there's really two ways you can use waste heat. You can use it to actually heat, or ironically, again, you can actually convert heat to chilling. And so we'll have some other equipment that has to go on the roof that will actually take all of the waste, waste heat off of the fuel cells and either convert it to heating for other areas and put it in the air, or they'll turn it into cooling. The whole objective with the fuel cells is not. It relates to not only how much gas you use, but how efficiently they run. So we want to. Another way that we can really minimize the impact in terms of how much gas we use is to make sure getting every last bit of value out of the thermal capacity as well as the electrical capacity. And that's where the heat comes in. Great. The questions that I have for staff are about a lot of times when we talk about this energy area on commission, it's what is the enforcement mechanism, especially, that requires annual, like, compliance. And so my reading is that the enforcement is in carbon offsets. Is that if they so think, if they're not meeting the target, then it's purchasing offsets. Is that right? Am I reading that right? I believe you are reading that right. It is also not my area of expertise. Okay. But that's what. That's what we offered. Right? And so, and again, you know, like, that's. That is like, it's, you know, everybody else is still at, you know, like, at the DTE numbers. So, like, we're. We're saying if we don't get to 75% of that, we're gonna. We're gonna pay to make sure that we deliver that. Yeah. The practical consideration in that, too, is what happens.

You could be on time with knowing your numbers, but what happens if we don't know DTE's carbon intensity by the first month of the year? Oh, we'll be tracking that, too. We'll be tracking that in five minute intervals, too. Okay. Yeah. I mean, you might go back and audit it and you might say, well, you guys said it was this and it was this. And then, you know, like, we'll settle up, but, you know, we'll. It's. In order to. I'll just say this in order to meet our objectives, like I was telling you before about in terms of participating in the climate economy, you know, we need to know that. And it can't be wrong because we'll be selling carbon credits to other people, and they'll want accountability for the question about the enforceability in the development agreement. Missy unmuted to speak to. Thanks. Yeah. Thank you, Commissioner Mills, for the question. It's a really important one. And I just want to offer two things that I think are relevant in the compensation process, that is from sustainability advantage. One is we do annual greenhouse gas emissions in the first year at the. So we are always getting information about the GHD intensity of the electric grid. And, of course, we're following the studies in terms of fossil gas and how much is lost in distribution and what that means in terms of our greenhouse gas emissions inverse. So we have a baseline that we can be using to do a comparison here with the petitioner. The second thing I wanted to offer is that city council also passed a series of energy criteria and principles that move through the Energy commission that actually give guidance on what we mean when we say carbon offsets. Carbon offsets do not mean just going to the market in Ann Arbor and buying the cheapest offset you can get. We actually have very clear guidance from the city council that carbon offsets have to be additional new renewable energies that we're not displacing someone else on the system. So I just wanted to add that my assumption here, and I don't know if that is fully codified, is that when we do offensive, we don't do them like everybody else. We make sure that they really are significant enough. I think that probably needs to go into the development agreement. But I understand exactly what she's saying, that it's, you know, great. I would only add that in terms of proposed enforcement, it seems very clear. It seems very enforceable, actually. And then of the possible enforcement alternatives that I might. One might think of, such as like disconnect and connect to the electrical grid, or even a one time fine. This seems a very proportional, very reasonable, very enforceable, and also still furthers the same goal. So I would, without commenting about the very specific language, but the gist of this is something that staff supports, and overall it is enforceable. Commission Weatherby, did you want to add something? Yes. So just kind of following up on that. While I trust you and your interest in this, should there be a different owner at some point who is like, we just use the gas. Why are we doing messing with all this stuff? All that is covered under the development agreement through these, what we just talked about, right? So, yes, the zoning runs with the land. So regardless of the owner, the requirement to. If you accept this and it gets rezoned, then this district requires who, whoever the owner is, to operate a continuous micro grid. The development agreement is between the city and this particular developer. But I believe there's a language in it that talks about it applies to successors. If this project never gets built, then the development agreement would also be moot, because this south town project never rebuilt. But the zoning says, even if the south town project looks vastly different, there are still four things that any that one with the land, which would be the performance criteria of 60% to 75% of the business as usual, which is DTE. Regardless of how they got there, procedurally speaking, it will move on to city council as well. It's just a recommendation. Commissioner Adams? Yeah. I feel like I should explain my earlier question. I think since we're stuck with the proposal on the table, I'm inclined to support it as presented. The project's fantastic, and I don't want to tie it up. And it's such an innovative proposal, and it's an innovative project, and it's great. But I asked about rejecting the offer and striking the condition, because I'm worried that this isn't the type of thing we ought to be doing in our zoning code. If anything, these things seem more appropriate to put into a development agreement or a site plan. My concern here is that the terms of the offer letter that you submitted make it clear that the actual way this is going to work is far more nuanced and complicated than what's in the zoning contemplates, right?

Absolutely. The zoning says continuously operational. The zoning has these targets. Zoning is the law. The development agreement and site plan don't trump what's in the zoning. So later on, when there's a liquidated damages provision that says we buy carbon offsets if we fail, the zoning language doesn't tolerate, on its face, the plain terms say you will continuously operate and you will hit those targets. So as an attorney, I can't square those things, and I would rather have tackled all of these requirements if I could in the development agreement and the site plan, because those documents will make allowances for the things that inevitably happen with systems that's complicated. They sometimes fail, they sometimes don't hit the targets. But the language that we're being asked to put into our laws doesn't, again, doesn't contemplate that. I worry about the enforcement. I worry about a zoning requirement that measures compliance using unverifiable data generated by a third party power company. That seems unusual to me. And then finally, as with all of these things, I worry about the fact of codifying something into the code that no future, future project. If, heaven forbid, your project doesn't launch, we now have a parcel that's got this highly specific, highly technical energy generation requirement baked into the zoning we're going to have to deal with. So those are my concerns. I think I'm stuck. Can I ask you a couple. Am I allowed to ask questions? Yes. Okay, please respond. So the first question I have is. Well, it's just a comment. I think what I'm sensing is that, for you, there's a disconnect between the, you know, what you. The actions you might have to take to get to 60% to 75% of performance against DTE. As you know, there's a disconnect between. Okay, I will buying carbon credits as specified by the city, which I think the language probably needs to be cleaned up to be more like what Missy said, not just acres of land and a swiss forest or something like that. The, you know, I think a future, if there was ever an issue, I think somebody would just come back and say, let me just connect to the DTE grid like you let everybody else, you know, and I won't use. I'll use gas only for emergency, but the big thing is that you said that triggered, I should address this, is we would not be relying on DTE's performance. You know, there's self evaluation. There are other ways to. And that's what we've used to come up with that. I think it's 5975 ish metric tons of greenhouse gas is the counterfactual that we've calculated. So if we powered this with DTE electricity, that's how much greenhouse gas we would generate every year. That will not come from DTE. That'll come, and it won't come from us. It shouldn't come from us, will come from a third party that can authenticate that with authority. What we'll provide is we'll provide basically our metric information with kind of, like, full insight into the calculations and complete transparency in terms of how we got there. That's how we have to do everything. And I'm sure you sound very knowledgeable about this. The proof of impact in terms of this, any transitions in the carbon or transactions in the carbon market are becoming more and more and more, you know, kind of like price of admission. You have to be transparent, and you have to show your math. So you, somebody at the city, missy, might say, hey, I want to take a look at that report and take a look at it and say, hey, that math doesn't make sense to me. And she might have have a third party authenticate it. None of that language is in there. But, you know, how the city chooses to act on what I think is probably pretty important, not because it's our project, but because it is setting a standard that's up to the city. We just have to make sure that we create authentic data and we apply algorithms correctly, and we provide transparency. So we really do want it to be a legitimate proof of impact. They just can't stress that enough. Thank you. With that, do we have any other final thoughts before we move to a vote? Yes. Mister Hammershape, last comment. Oh, my question is for staff. You have a full agenda, and this is super cool. I understand less than 50% of it, but I'm really excited to hear innovations and sustainability. My concern is, or my question is about the annual sustainability report. Is OSI gonna review that? Like, is there a staff capacity for this or an appetite for it, or does this just continue forever? That's what it sounds like in the development agreement. Like, are you guys prepared to take this on? I guess is my question in gratuity. The city of Ann Arbor is prepared to take this on. I didn't mean you specifically. I understand. I think that is a level of detail that needs to be worked out.

But the city of Ann Arbor is prepared to take this on. I have one other small thing, the DTE connection, just to clarify. For gas, is it just for backup, or are you planning on. You are taking gas from them? Yeah. So we'll pay for the dairy farmer to inject the gas into the system. We'll just take the gas, but then we'll have all of those mechanisms to take the CO2 out and. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay. Last one. Council member. Dish. This is a question for Miss Daleo. So I understand commissioner Adams objections to the level of specificity that is in zoning here, but my understanding is that in a conditional zoning, or that conditional zoning is an established thing that exists in order to tie a site plan to the zoning. And that is something that is within the city's power to do. And am I missing something? No, not at all. Conditional zoning is. It doesn't have to tie a zoning district to a site plan because, I mean, it's a very broad tool. It is not contract zoning. It is conditional zoning. And if you think of it statewide or citywide, it is. We have the ability to accept conditions. Imagine you have a zoning district that allows a huge variety of land uses, but this particular location is right next to a very sensitive thing, and so half of those uses are not appropriate. And so this is a mechanism where we can say, well, you can zone at c three, but these ten uses are actually not allowed here. The basic one, the one rule of conditional zoning is that it must further limit whatever the normal allowances it cannot allow over, above and beyond, or it cannot add this particular south town one. It is very specific. The conditions that they offered are very nuanced, very specific, but they were voluntarily offered, and there is no. If you. If they do no harm, there is no reason not to accept them. And when I say do no harm, they seem to do no harm to the city. They are. Are very restrictive, but they were voluntarily offered, and the developer wants these conditions, and the city incurs no harm by accepting them. Did that answer your question? I think so. Thank you. And then. Oh, yeah. Final comment from yes, Commissioner Clark. So I think it's great that we're gonna have the density in this project here supportive of that. I guess I wanted to lean in favor of simplicity and zoning code, especially in mind in perpetuity. So just comment on that. I guess I just have a quick question. Will this be in concert with heat pumps? So water based heat pumps? Yeah. Okay. For the geothermal system. And has there been any leaks on site? Is there any risk for leaks on site, and has there been any research into that or you're meeting methane leaks? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that on site's really easy to control. What happens upstream, we don't have any control over. So I think, you know, whatever. Whatever one's interpretation of anything outside of that. But it's really buttoned down on sight because we're capturing the CO2 we're taking. That's like water energy CO2. It doesn't, you know, the off, off gassing. There's very limited things that it does in heat, so. And we're accounting for all of managing all of that. Okay, thanks. All right. Thank you. Thank you for the presentation. I think you've addressed all of my questions as well. And with that, we will go to a roll call vote. Miss Kelly on the motion is presented. Commissioner Lee. Yes. Commissioner Abrams. Yes.

Staff recommendation is approval when we have our petitioner in person. And so. Hello. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you for bearing with us. And then with that, yeah. We will move on to petitioner presentation and bear with us as we get this going. And just making sure that the clicker works for you guys. Okay. Go ahead and try that with that. Welcome. I'll hand it over to you guys. All right, thanks so much. I am Wendy Carty Saxon, director of real estate development at Avalon Housing, and we'll go over our team members shortly, but really appreciate you having us here so we can chat about a pv request for Hickory Way apartments three development. Great. So I'll just briefly go a little bit about Avalon. I think folks know a fair bit, and then the development team and then really diving into what we're asking for here. So this is Avalon. So we're really excited, as Avalon, to bring another new construction development into the city. We currently have two developments under construction at the moment. And then in 2021, we brought 70 units online adjacent to this particular property, photography way one and two. And frankly, we've been eyeing this parcel since we were looking at planning those particular units. So we're really excited about being here. Now, a quick background. Hickory Way three is currently in Sioux Township. We have a purchase agreement with the city of Ann Arbor for it. And I can say that's really been helpful because having public owners allows us a chance to have the time that we need. Mission of Avalon. I think folks are pretty familiar with both healthy, safe and inclusive supportive housing communities as a long term solution to homelessness and offering flexible, voluntary onsite services to accomplish that. And just a couple pictures of existing properties. And we do supportive housing since 92. So our development team. I'll just mention we've got a couple folks from Avalon on the phone if there are any questions. We've got Aaron Cooper, our executive director, Brie Carpenter, our director of employee experience, and John Scott, our construction project manager. Now I'll hand it over to Brandon to. Good evening, everybody. My name is Brandon Hodges. I'm the principal of tribe development. We are a Detroit headquartered affordable housing developer and consultant will be serving as development consultant with Avalon Housing on this transaction. As you can probably see, you know, it takes a village to do an affordable housing deal. And so we have a very dynamic team. We have in the room, Fusco, safer and Papas, who will be our architect of record. We will be releasing a contractor, RFP very shortly. We are going full steam ahead in our design process and wanted to have that contractor selection kind of pick up with that process. We also have make an engineering as our civil engineer. Asti Environmental has done most of our environmental assessments to date. And we also have hired a wetland consultant given some conditions on site, so that would be ect. And then Avalon housing will also be the property manager for the site. So this is a bit of an aerial view of the proposed location. As you can see, this is an interesting time stamp because the Hickory Way one and two is being built directly north. That is, as Wendy mentioned, 70 units in total across two buildings. This side is also directly north of the Hanson nature area, which is directly south. And so this is right on 1146 South Maple on the western side of the street. Our civil engineers provided a bit of comparative zoning analysis. As Wendy mentioned, this will be an annexation that we'll be going through. It's currently located inside of a township, so no real zoning exist today. And Wendy will touch on why we felt the pud zoning designation was most appropriate for our pursuit of this affordable housing project. But this just gives a little bit of an insight into how we thought about the site, the efficiency and some of the calculations relative to existing conditions, but also the r four E. I'll let Wendy kind of touch on the date. Thanks. So, with requesting the PD, you know, certainly the beneficial impact bringing affordable housing as part of this development. Half of the units looking at being supportive housing, all of the units being affordable, under 60%. So affordable housing and also energy efficiency in green, which we'll touch on in a little bit. We did explore the current zoning districts, and we ran into challenges further leading us to the PuD flexibility for affordable housing, with the PuD being the mechanism that really allows that flexibility to bring affordable housing where we otherwise might run into hiccups with standard zoning, land use. But a four story building with 39 units, 15% are accessible. And, you know, it also has our services and management space in there. And really, we feel represents the most compatible and efficient land use practice. Aligning our objectives while respecting the neighborhood context, optimizing the site utilization. Here, we think the building footprint really uses the site, accommodating our landscape buffers, fire truck access. Parking was expressed by staff and tenants, and walkable access from Hickory Way one and two. We're really looking at interaction between these two sites. Food pantry, community events. So, you know, minimizing the distance between those two, you know, with a lower side setback is that we feel it's beneficial to us. Barrier free parking and charging stations.

We're running into incompatibility with existing zoning district dimensions, you know, don't know specifically setbacks. Major issue we were running into, so we couldn't achieve our optimal number of units with the height and the building footprint envisioned. Having us move to the rezoning for Pud for economic and functional feasibility and the neighborhood character, really. You know, we think the design really enhances the character, you know, emphasizing, you know, the green space connecting to Hanson park nearby. Pedestrian, frankly, layout. And again, that integration and the proximity to hickory level one and two. And I'll just note that another thing, that with the continual affordable housing, one of the things that the petitioner might be funny, but with the pud, I kind of like that the affordability gets attached to the land and the zoning so in perpetuity with you guys. So I just think that's another benefit of the Pud for this. So hand it back over to Brandon. So we did want to briefly mention we do have a wetland condition on the site. We've already spoken with Egle, had a pre application meeting. It has been noted as unregulated and low quality, but it's a little over 0.08 acres. And so we've run a handful of scenarios to try to orient the site as far away as possible from that weather condition. And ECT will be the wetland consultant that will help shepherd us through further scenario analysis. Because of the federal funding that we're going to be applying for for the project, we have to go through a fairly elaborate step process. And so that consultant team help us navigate that process. This is just a bit of overview of the actual project program. As Wendy mentioned, we have 39 units that will be on site across four floors of housing. All the units will be one bedrooms, serving populations up to 60% AMI. But we imagine the majority of the building will be deeply skewed affordable housing. This will be permanent supportive housing projects. Least 35% of units will be designated for those supportive housing tents. There will be onsite services across the building. One of the things that we do like is the adjacency to the existing hickory one and two to drive efficiency and really impact in that trade area. We are also going to do an enhanced amount of bike storage on site. We will have really interesting community rooms. We will have a laundry room on each floor. There will be shared outdoor community space that will actually play off of the existing outdoor space. At Hickory. Railway one and two. Central air conditioning will be featured as well as high speed Internet. And we'll have control door access. And I'll let our architect team talk a little bit about our sustainability focus. Just quick time check you two and a half minutes. My name is Scott Kelly. I'm from Feesco shift for Pappas Architects where I'm from Dale, Michigan. And we're honored to work with Avalon housing in this project. As far as the sustainability. I don't think we can get to the level of the project before us, but we do. We do understand the 820 guidelines and we definitely want to adhere to a lot of those guidelines as we move forward in this project. And along with the goals of the a 20 kind of go hand in hand with the low income housing as it can relate to better quality of life for the residents and better use of the building for the property management group and add on housing as they kind of navigate through the years of the project. Our building is going to incorporate a lot of sustainable design elements. Obviously, they're going to well exceed the Michigan building code. Features include an insulated envelope, high performance windows with advanced ear ceiling, electric heating systems and energy star rated appliances, energy efficient lighting, all led lighting equipped with occupancies to further enhance the conservation of efforts. And then also the materials that are being used within the project. Making sure that they are sustainable and meet a lot of the different requirements of fluoroscore certification. And making sure that we're using low VOC products in terms of paints and the flooring. And making sure a lot of the adhesives and construction materials that we're using are of a high quality and are sustainable products. As well as making sure that prevention and during construction and afterwards, that there is a waste management program to make sure that we are dealing with all the construction waste and or waste from the building is taken care of correctly. All right, we're at time. Is there anything further that you wanted to add? If you add one additional minute, sure. It would be important. Yeah, two minutes. So this is kind of a.

Just go one more. There is a hidden slide train. Here's basically a layout of the units, all one bedroom units. A lot of the support spaces for the community are in the front of the building by the front entry. We will have plenty of bike storage and bike parking out in the front. A lot of the back of the house items are. And towards in the back of the building in terms of electrical, mechanical and things like that. It's kind of an elevations, more computer generated. And then I'll get to there. This is more of the renderings for the building at the moment. A little bit different than the phase one and phase two. But we feel that, you know, the architecture fits well. Especially trying to make sure that we're using sustainable materials with the brick at the bottom. As well as using a lot of the state sustainable aluminum throughout the project. That's all good. Perfect. Thank you for. Thank you for. This is a pre pud conference. There's no public hearing, but we'll go on to staff and we'll go right into discussions, Mister Kowalski. So just to kind of summarize up a lot of what has been said, but really with any pud, the first step is really meeting with staff determining what zoning districts. Why pick a pud over a different zoning district? And this one's a little different in that most of the puds you see are existing in the city that have a zoning set. Obviously, this, as mentioned, was a township parcel. They'll be annexed. The really type of the closest zoning district that matches the land use and the density that is proposed would be the r four E district. So the r four E district, the density more than complies. I mean, the r four E district is significantly denser, but the Highland is not an issue with that either, because there's a height limit in the r four e. But however, the main issue that comes up is the setbacks that were identified. So working through, again, kind of with the petitioner and trying to see if there's a different zoning district we could use. As I said, really we focus upon the r four e. The challenges with that are the setbacks. Our code also has a. There's provisions within the zoning code that have, like our standard setbacks for the. It's 10ft. However, if you exceed building length over 50ft. I drawn a blank on it. If you see the building length, I believe it's over 50ft. And the height over a certain. I'm drawing a blank on that as well now too. But there's additional setback that's required for the additional height that you exceed above the limit and for the additional building length. So you add that onto one of the setbacks. So adding that onto the setback to the. It would be onto the north side there that pushes the required setback. I believe it was 28ft. And so that's quite a significant setback. To accommodate that setback in an r four E district, obviously, the plan would have to be significantly altered. If, I mean, the building would have to slide over, you'd probably eliminate the parking and so on and so forth. And obviously, one of the most important point to that is it would obviously result in a smaller building. So going through pud justifications, we look at that kind of thing as well. Like one of our, obviously our priority goals in the city, as everybody well knows, housing and specifically affordable housing. So in the ask on this, we look through and we see, well, what, what is really the ask on it? Like, are they asking for something that's completely unreasonable and, you know, these, this, that's not going to fly in this case, but that's not what they're asking here. Again, it's a setback modification. They do meet, like I said, as the standard setback, but the additional setbacks that are required push that even larger. So in this case, while again, we don't want to default to puds, that should be kind of a last case scenario. But really, in this case, it's really the only way to accomplish and get a public benefit that the city and a priority goal of affordable housing, as well as accommodating all the restrictions and again, the design considerations and restrictions that the applicant has to set that up. So really, and this is, again, obviously a pre pud conference, this is a point for you guys as planning commission to give your feedback. We did, we don't do an extensive staff review before this. I mean, we do kind of a preliminary review. We did have a look at the plans. They have a pretty complete plan set that has already been, that we've already viewed. It's not submitted yet, but that we've already reviewed.

It's not submitted yet, but that we've already reviewed. So most of the issues have been kind of flagged, flagged by staff previously. And really one of the most prominent ones, as was mentioned, is the wetland issue and the natural features on the site. The wetland, again mentioned was a low quality wetland. That will be, obviously, as we go when the project is formally submitted, that will be reviewed by our city staff as well, going out there with their natural features staff. And there's a significant, I don't know about significant, but there are quite a few landmark trees on the site. And if you go by it now, it's pretty, it's pretty wooded as well. But with those, you know, obviously, again, a goal of the city, preserve natural features and things. So they did their alternatives analysis, which is required for any site plan. Basically, how can you put your use on this. How can you design your building on the site, accomplish what you want by mitigating that impact on natural features on this site? It's really challenging because, again, where that wetland is kind of located in the center of the site, that kind of leads into the middle of the site and the natural features. Sorry, the trees are kind of sprinkled all around the site. They are saving a significant section of them in the would be, what? The northwest corner there, as you see. So those trees will be saved as well. And obviously, landscaping will be compliant with city code, so that's kind of it. We don't necessarily have a formal recommendation at this point, but again, staff is supportive of the pud moving forward. Could I just ask if planner Shaikh would have anything to add? Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. And pleasure to be officially present here. My first commission meeting. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more really quickly to. The issues really are around the setbacks and both the front setback and the sidebacks setback. And they're both kind of quirky, I guess. So Matt mentioned the regulations. The regulation for side setbacks and four e is 10ft plus 3ft for every foot over a 35 foot building, plus 1.5 inches for every foot over 50ft of building length. So the building length is 168, building height is 48ft, I believe. So those together make the side tech back requirement go up in the minimum of ten to 28 to 28. So it is of note that the adjacent building is Avalon. I'm not sure if it's part one or part two, but. But it's the adjacent Avalon site. And on the front setback. It's a really curious case, too, where there's a right of way designation in the front because it is a township and it is a township parcel that hasn't been incorporated into the city of Ann Arbor yet. So the annexation will run parallel to this process. So the front. So the one, as you can see in the staff memo and the documents, the 1ft setback that couldn't meet the r four e setback requirements is the 1ft from the right of way designation that's designated there. And I could just add that may that the front setback. We're working through that with staff right now, with engineering, basically, because what it shows as a right of way, if they dedicate right away to the city, then that comes off their property. And that, you know, that's their setback, is to that line of the right of way. However, there's also an opportunity which is, again, kind of over the last couple days, we've been working with engineering, which is potentially, you just grant an easement for the right of way if the city ever needs it, basically. So an easement does not count against their land. So the setback, the front setback issue may or may not be, be an issue going forward. But even again, if it seems kind of shocking at first, I have a 1ft setback. In reality, it's more. I mean, the road is not going to. We're not going to be expanding Maple road over there. There are utilities and things like that in there, but that is consistent with the right of way that was granted to the Hickory Way projects above. But the main takeaway from this is that right of way. That front setback number might be in flux there because it may end up being. If that right of way is just through an easement, then their setback would probably adjust to the previous along the road, right 1ft inside of the sidewalk, which is pretty typical. But again, the main issue that does kind of leave the side setback issue as well. Got it. Thank you for that presentation. Again, there's no public comment here. And procedurally, just so that I understand, this is going to be, this is a pre pud application. They will eventually get our feedback and then they're going to come back for probably an annexation and a Pud recommendation. Well, it'll be submitted. So the project will be submitted all through. There'll be, when the project is submitted, it'll be submitted as an annexation, zoning and site plan. Okay, so planning commission will see all three of those at the same time, the annexation, zoning and site plan.

So you guys will see everything as one piece. Got it. And assuming that, again, the feedback and discussion here, is this pud truly the appropriate venue, etcetera. So great. Commissioner Mills, please kick this off. Great. I think if in terms of the standards that we have for PUD, this makes a lot of sense. And actually, I, given the way that the right of way works there, I think the idea of encouraging things that move it back up and maybe even force it up would be better also, just the. Practically speaking, I think then you see the kind of jog it's not paralleling. I mean, it is paralleling the building, but there, it's a little off set from the one. So like, just thinking about light, right. Nobody's ever gonna be in shadow all day long, even in the dead of winter. Because whichever way, like there's some coming in. So I think that that's useful. I am curious. I do think, though, this makes a whole lot of sense. You guys have the land now. Who knows what can happen? I'm curious. Right? So it would run with the land if in then the pud, the uses. I don't know. I don't know how you tie. I don't think it makes sense to tie it to an owner. But I think that tying in the affordability is really important. Just so that if something happens, like we are sure that this will also be supportive housing. And I think if I can add to that. Right. That's another, I guess, benefit of that pud is. That is exactly right. We can tie that into the pud zoning with an r four e zoning or similar. We can. So the pud has that mechanism. So if whatever. Avalon, hopefully it didn't go away or whatever, but the zoning is in place. So whoever builds on that has to adhere to the pud. That would give me a little bit more comfort. Because the place. Because the place that we are impacting is just to the north, right? I mean, yes, it protects you from your. I don't know. Like not protecting you from yourself, but maybe. I don't know. I think. I think that that's really helpful in this particular situation. I think that this makes tons of sense. Commissioner Wech, I have two questions. The first one is to staff. It's a great project, but I just have some dumb questions. C one a, do we consider c one a because it has no setbacks? Setback is conditional to the residential that it abuts. And does our removal of the conflicting land use buffers address that? Because it doesn't have the height restrictions, it won't have as strict front setback restriction. Right. Well, first. The first answer is no. That's right. That'll be fine. I don't know if that. If anybody wants to give us a c one, a comparison when they go to the qud. Yeah, it could be challenging with the different uses that would. And again with that district, we wouldn't have a way of guaranteeing affordability going forward. We would, but yeah, we could. Look, sure. Yes. And that leads me to my second question is, because it's a pud, does it have a requirement for an additional contribution? To the affordable housing trust fund because of the underlying zoning, or is it because it's coming in from the township that's waived? No, it would still. There's still a formula that even if it came in from the township, there's still a way that we would have to calculate, if market rate project came in here, there would still be a way to calculate, based on our land use recommendations and things like that, of an affordable housing contribution. So just because it would be annexed, and you're right, like, there's no cities owning in place there, but there would still be an affordable housing requirement for any pud. But again, this one will. I mean, technically, this one has one, too, but it's more than exceeding it. So it's a 100% affordable. So that's. That's with units on site. Pardon? Units on site changed hands. That's still the zoning. It would. They would have to go if it changed owners. Anything else? That zoning is still in place. They would have to go. They would just have to make a contribution. Well, they would have to. We can. So, again, writing, we haven't got, obviously, this far into it, but writing the supplemental regulations that go with the zoning project, we have the ability as a city to write whether or not they with. Again, they're working with them, whether or not they want that option in the field. Like with any other applicant, we would work with them to say, well, you could do the units on site, or you can do the contribution in lieu, so we can write that in development agreement. I think in this case, we would probably. I would assume the applicant would be okay with us just writing units have to be on site so that again, even if for whatever reason, God forbid, you know, Avalon and this group goes away, anybody that that zoning has to, th", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Unnamed Project/Developer", "insights": [{"observation": "Practically speaking, I think then you see the kind of jog it's not paralleling.

It has to all be affordable housing on that site to whatever AMI like. We can specify those different numbers within that. And the only way to change that, again would be to go all the way back, we're starting with you, and then going all the way to city council to change that zoning. So no matter who owns the site, that pud zoning is, in effect, just a note on the sea zoning. Our land use element is in the process of being updated now, but in the 2009 land use element, it does address potential for different types of housing specifically. So whether or not designated as a sea zoning would be in conflict with that or not, because all the other neighboring uses are residential uses. But there are some interesting differences in setbacks between the different zoning master categories. I guess between C and R. Great. Thank you. Any other commissioners question? So I just said just a couple comments on the thing on the plan. The balconies love that. Just wanted to throw that out there because so often you don't get nice amenities, like with affordable housing, and it's nice to see that. And also the interaction between sites, that's something that we often see people trying not to have interaction between sites. And so it's really great to see interaction between sites. And I realize that you're sort of both sites, so that makes it easier. But it's still. I appreciate that it is not, like, walled off from other sites. Commissioner Amerschmitt, thank you for thinking about sustainability. Have you considered whether or not you want to be all electric? Yes, there will be. You will be. Oh, put that on your bullet points. I didn't see it. I forgot that. Oh, he status li. Bullet points. He's probably reading the bullet points. And that can be added to the supplemental regulations. Yes, it can. Awesome. Thank you. I will stay at our hickory weight one and two. We did all electric for the unit. We did gas for the common in Viridian. We did all doing all electric. Frankly, we're still working out that we're calibrating those units correctly so they come on at the right temperature. Intent on this one. And I think that's. Oh, no. What? It's just interesting for us to note that an affordable housing unit can go all electric because a lot of times we hear people say they can't go all electric because of the cost. You're right. Working on our calculations. Thank you. Any other commissioners with thoughts about applicability of Pud? This really is a pre petition conference to evaluate whether this is appropriate application, I guess I'll add. Oh, I was going to say my silence is an indication of no concern. Yeah. Not indifference, but support. Yeah. Same. It is interesting about the applicability of Pewdiepie here. I mean, as long as we've exhausted kind of like, other zoning categories as far as all the other kind of checklist items, you guys have really hit. So I think if this makes sense, I would also be using as well. So one other thing I would add to that, too, again, like, if we were thinking just as I mentioned before, like, we don't want to default to puds. Really don't justify that. But so if this was just probably a standard market rate project that's just coming with the apartment, you know, and it was just that side setback for the, you know, that this would be it would be a different discussion because again noted that the significant priority goal, the city affordable housing, this more than exceeds any requirement that is a definitive public benefit that the city will achieve by going forward with a minor setback issue. So let me just ask one quick question that I was thinking. I noted that 20 parking spots, there's 36 units. And obviously you need fire lane for making sure that you have compliance. In that respect. How does utilization in your units kind of look like? And what led you to say, hey, we want the 20 slide? Was it just a spacing thing or how did you. Can you get through the gym? Yeah, so we worked with our property management staff, talked to tenants, our maintenance staff. So we've got 39. So about one, this we're doing, we're going to do half. And the thing we talked about, 35%, but I think half will be supportive housing. We don't tend to have as much utilization for our support of housing residents. The other half we're looking to just be affordable, getting a little bit more of a mix. There are other sites, often we kind of say that, but they're really all supportive housing. So here with that and kind of exploring it, we want to make sure that it all works for the entire site. So that's why we've got it. Gotcha. And does EV readiness. I don't know if pud EV installed, ready is applicable or not. I don't know that I saw any of those. It wouldn't necessarily because unless we wanted to, because again, as a PUD, we have the ability to all the parking, again, requirements and things like that could be a subject for discussion. I mean, it definitely will be a question when staf", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Avalon", "insights": [{"observation": "It has to all be affordable housing on that site.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The balconies love that.

I mean, it definitely will be a question when staff gets to review, like will EVB pardon how much will be added and things like that. Just food for thought. Not really. Again, I think the applicability of a Pud still, which has a principle formatter of this particular discussion, I think it fits kind of all the categories. So Commissioner Weatherby, you wanted that? I think my thing about the PuD, I think it perfectly applicable. I think my concern is that in the future the Pud is going to be more of a pain for you than it is. I don't have a problem approving it because of the use and all that. But it just does make things a little more complicated on your side. If you go to change something or if you go to that, it then requires coming before. And so that's just something to think about that like it is more flexible upfront, but not necessarily more flexible over the lifetime of the project. Well, I'll note on that. Trying to learn from earlier ones, like when we did our viridian and our pud, we committed to enterprise green certification, and someone else in the our side, someone else in the office said, you sure you don't want to say equivalent? I'm like, no, no, no, that's fine. That's what we do. We always do. Well, we're now looking to do a different standard, national building standards. So, frankly, we're doing both now because we have it in the zoning. So we're also learning from past ones and trying to keep in mind language when we get down to the writing in ourselves and more than we. Yes. Yeah. So, yeah. And I noticed that you have or equivalent in the language here. I just wanted to ask, because is it half or 35% of the unit that are supportive? So to get into the tax credit round that we wanted to be, we have to be 35%. Okay. So we wrote that, drafted it up, actually, for an earlier meeting. Trying not to over commit for that, but in subsequent conversations with our services team and where we want to go, we're looking. We're planning to commit to half as the supportive house. Okay, so you have the language in your proposal here right now. Now is up to 35%. So maybe you could say something like minimum. Minimum 35%. And that way, if you end up doing half, that's great. If you don't, you hit the minimum that you need for the funding category, then. Thank you for that last comment for me. Bike parking. Just, were there any intentional thoughts given to kind of location or storage if we don't have as many parking spaces? Or how are people getting around bus stops and proximity, but also bicycles? Any thoughts on that? Respect? Well, we definitely have it. It would be more towards the front for the bike parking. It may not show up on that, but I think we also, if you go to the floor plan, we also have a bike storage room. We've got for interior storage for bicycle parking as well on that first floor. So we're definitely making accommodations for that. Awesome. Thank you. Any other thoughts from commissioners at this point in the juncture? Does a petitioner, pre petitioner, do you guys think you have kind of what you were hoping for? Feedback? Yeah, largely, it seems to be in support of the applicability of PUD after innovation in land use, affordable housing, etcetera. So, staff, any final thoughts? No. With that, I think we can conclude. Thank you. Thank you. All right, how's everyone doing? Just energy. You guys want to crush through the CBC or you guys want to take five? I think we should power three. Okay. All right. But I'm willing. Sounds like a plan. All right, we are moving on to the next item, which is CPC work program. I'm going to introduce this, which is the 2024 2025 city Planning Commission work program discussion and adoption work programs adopted on an annual basis pursuant to commissions bylaws. On October 17, 2023, planning commission reviewed and adopted a 23 to 24 work program. The present proposal updates the status of all items, includes line items for recent city council resolutions and other new work since October. Staff recommendation is approval. With that, I will turn it over to mix Kelly for staff presentation. Thank you. The last time that we had discussion about bylaws, it was, excuse me, about work program. It was significantly past the indication of when the work program should be adopted by the planning commission and the bylaws it specifies May. And so in the. Let me just do the minimal amount of hybrid participation that we can here was to just share that. We'd like to get back to that may deadline. This does not mean that this is the only time that you can do updates to the work program throughout the year, but that you are supposed to do at least one update of it. Now we have two meetings in May. Your next meeting has about six items on it and getting requests for more all the time. So seems to be feasted famine for our planning commission agenda items. But so even though the plan was, the work program was adopted in October, there still were a lot of things to update and clean up.

But so even though the plan was, the work program was adopted in October, there still were a lot of things to update and clean up. For example, there are a lot of new council resolutions that we still don't have certainty about exactly when those will take place, if they will be undertaken in house or by an external consultant. Those are conversations that are happening primarily with Mister Delacourt, Mister Lennart and deputy city administrator, and of course city council. But I wanted to place just a note that those are happening and that there are early discussions around them and then when they start to be assigned, there will be a lot of work. And then there's some times where we just, we don't always predict the work that comes up. And a good example of that is the TC one text amendment, which we didn't necessarily anticipate when this was prepared last October because we had just been in the process of crafting so many other changes to the TC one district. But now there's a significant project proposal that I think many people would love to see work with this zone and happen by. Right. And that was now moved up. So there've been. It's been before the planning commission twice. It'll be in front of you again for another discussion out of the ORC. Advancing to the working session, we hope, next week. So I can go through what the red lines are, but there are a few options. Tonight you could decide to just continue under your October plan. You could adopt the staff proposed plan, you can make adjustments to either of those, or you could review request that we table this and discuss it at a future meeting. It will not be your next meeting, which would take us out of May. Otherwise you'd have seven items. There were only three on tonight's agenda. And here we are. It's only. The night is young. There's a tornado. It's just a watch. It's not a tornado watch. And we're already safe. Yeah. Feels like time moves differently down here. So just a summary of basically what's been happening with your work program in numbers. In 2023, we completed eight items and we started four. There were twelve items total. In 2024, we have 13 started items. Some of those represent a lot of other items, like the council resolutions, but it's quite an increase from the previous year and also from 2022. And then in 2025, this is kind of like where things that might shift around even further have been placed. And then we peeled out items, as in the version that you saw in October, that, in consultation with manager Leonard, make most sense for the comprehensive plan. And so then those of those, there are ten items identified, and then there's some ongoing work that is not insignificant for staff. For example, this is not like a tidying year for CIP. This is a project proposal year, but it's also a year where we are making a lot of efforts to improve our selection criteria. In some cases, we're entirely rewriting them. And this is from the perspective of equity and sustainability criteria that pervade every single asset group, and also individually in all of the asset groups. We've been asked by the planning commission to be more heavily involved and to provide more information into the CIP process. And so we've tried to take that charge to heart. And so it has been, again, we're just working from the same pool of staff for all items, pretty much. So that is another thing that affects our capacity. So, looking at our red lines here, there were some things that were started in 2023 that I. If they were completed, but they weren't marked complete before I put it in red, I clarified the title of this, so I put it in red. But it actually, this, for some reason was not on the work plan before, but this was completed and this was approved by city council in January. The TC one Plymouth corridor Washtenaw is still in process. I gave an estimated date for when that will be advancing to the planning commission. So, so this is all in your packet. You can see this. If you have questions about it, you can let me know in discussion. I did provide some indication of things that were moved and tried to explain why, and that gave us the proposed version for adoption, which has accepted changes at the end. So this is what is referenced in your motion? I think that's, yeah. And then I also had your original approved. If we want to take a look at that on the screen, I can pull it up. Got it. Thank you for the, the priming of that. And then. So the proposed motion that I'm going to read is the Ann Arbor City Planning Commission adopts the 2024 25 city Planning Commission work program. We'll go into discussion with. Moved by Commissioner Abrams and seconded by councilmember Dish. We're in discussion and I'd like for actually this to be fairly flowing. So this one, actually, we don't have the following. So I want to thank you very much, Miss Kelly, for the clarity of what you've presented to us here and the notations about things having been moved up because they are either being worked on or they were aligned with a comp plan or they are part of the economic development resolutions or whatever.

So I want to thank you very much, Miss Kelly, for the clarity of what you've presented to us here and the notations about things having been moved up because they are either being worked on or they were aligned with a comp plan or they are part of the economic development resolutions or whatever. That's really helpful. So I just want to note, I just want, I just want to note that 2023 is more than twice 2022. And that in 2024, all those things that say CC resolution placeholder, the four things, those are going to take more than four lines when the substance of those come in. Some of those are three things at least. So. Yeah, some of them have 20 things. Yes. Oh, yes. Yes. We can say that, too. So I am, I am really reluctant to move anything else. I, you know, I just think we just don't know what's coming and what's on. The 2024 work plan here is responsive to not only petitioners, you know, text amendment requests, which I guess we kind of have to respond to those. But the staff discussion with co ops, which is been going on for some time, has also been moved up in response to discussions aligned with the comp plan and some importance that council attaches to that. So I'm not saying that we should vote on this right here now because maybe we're not quite ready and we have questions and we want staff to come back and give us a memo or just give us some more information. But I really hope that we're not going to stuff any more things in there because I just think it's completely unrealistic. Because even if we hire external, even if the city hires external help for some of the economic development, they're all part of economic development, even though only one is called that, they still have to be supervised. I mean, and so it's not, it's not as if, oh good, we can hive all that work off. No, there's a lot of interaction. I mean, I think we all saw that with the work that we did with the fine consulting team that we had for the, for the premium change that still required a lot of work from staff. So I feel that I am in a spirit of caution about this work plan because it's meaningless if it's totally unrealistic. And so, but I think that we are going to have a lot of long meetings because we are moving into the comp plan implementation season. On top of that, we have this initiative led by the deputy city administrator, which actually is part of what Mister Garber brought up before, and addresses some things that we, we've all been talking about as priorities for us. They are incorporated in some of those things. So that's more than two cent or. No, it's about two cent worth, but spoken at too great length. Very good. Thank you for that feedback. My thought was actually with Mister Westfall's comment about assigning months, or at least quarters to them, that helps us to at least get a sense of like, when are we really going to tackle and what's the sequence of things? Is there any kind of temporal order that you have here? Is it in order of kind of when we expect things to hit? Or is it just like, let's dump it into this bucket? I think if we put months to it, we could always put months to it, but they would just be moving around all the time because the like, text amendment that we received, we didn't understand when that would be be. We thought that we were going to get a much earlier head start on building height and average finish grade. We had a draft from our consultant and then there was disagreement among staff about whether or not to move forward with the proposal that was presented. And then we ran into some capacity issues to retake it up, because again, there have to be check in meetings. There needs to be sometimes joint work meetings with consultants. It would be really nice if we could just hand things to people and then they turn it back to us. Perfect. But it's more of a collaborative thing. So we actually did try to, you know, just for that item, for example, move that forward several months ago, but we ran into wall. So I think that I would be happy to put months in here, but I don't think that they would give extra certainty to. I don't think they would necessarily provide the certainty that is sought after by adding them. Got it. Okay. Understood. I was thinking from maybe a prioritization or even like a quarter standpoint, so that we're like, oh, in this three month bucket, maybe this can get kind of tackled something. But I understand it's an iterative process. So some things are do feel like more prescient. The timing of them. For example, the text amendment. We don't want to lag too far behind a significant project that could add a lot of housing and be really great for the city. We want to be responsive to that and also responsive to the fact that changing the zone could benefit many districts in the city. So city council, of course, they're our boss and telling us that there are certain things that are important to them. We're taking that really seriously. So there are certain things that if they become matter of city policy, it may be different than a nice to have item, for example, that might be covered through another discussion and not to demote it, but like the co op discussion, there are a lot of different factors there.

It's married to group housing, it's married to some other things about unrelated persons. It feels like it would take a long time to resolve. If there's something discreet that is in the council resolutions that we can take up immediately, then it's going to move to the top of the queue. The pro housing grant, we just don't know if we will be receiving that. If we do receive it, then we will immediately have to start work on it with the city of Ypsilanti and dedicate staff time. And it would be a really great opportunity and it would be a good idea for us to move that higher. If we get it, it would be really exciting. So. Got it. I sense a little bit of hesitation. It seems like a futile effort, really, because we have to reprioritize when we get feedback from external parties, as you were saying. So may not be worth a squeeze, is what I'm hearing. Commissioner White. So I do want to move things up into 2024, unlike my colleague who asked for us not to do that, namely, I just want to name the things I'd like to move up from 2025 into 2024, because I really do believe the majority of our time in 2025 will be spent on the comp plan text amendments. So the bike parking requirements, I think that needs to come up into this calendar year because we're continuing to see developments and it feels accessible to me in terms of something. Well, actually, I won't justify. I'll just say this is what I want. The other piece is the traffic studies, I think that is in the transportation review criteria. Is that correct? Before I say the wrong thing, could you point out to me transportation demand management? No. In 2023, right under the last green line, there is a transportation review criteria. The second reading of that is going to. Right. The first reading was yesterday. Yeah, I have the wrong date there, but the second reading will be a month from now. Is that the consideration of, like, the de emphasizing of cars and traffic as congestion and more into the multimodal? Because that's what I remember from last year. That's what that amendment was. Yes. It changed all of the references from traffic to transportation, multimodal transportation. And it reduced some redundant criteria to the Institute of Transportation Engineers guide. Yeah. Because I think this. We have comments in our packet today of the development that's coming on Silo church. That's 75 townhomes. And the person who wrote in is it's going to add all these cars. And I live on Silo church and it's not going to add any of those cars. They're not actually going to notice that those cars are actually there. And so moving. I guess that's already in line. That's hard. I almost marked it complete, but I don't want to speak for success. All right, great. I think it's going to be approved. It will likely be approved, but I thought I almost marked the agreement. I'm like, that's not been voted on. You don't want to jinx. The unzoning is still something since I've sat at the table. I have. Okay, great. And the other piece is the mixed use neighborhoods. I think it's going to be helpful to get some of that conversation started sooner rather than later, because as I was even sitting here thinking of the pud that we just saw, I thought, gosh, if we had a different zoning category than the ones that we currently have, is it possible that they would have benefited from that zoning category as opposed to putting them into a pud? And I appreciated commissioner Weatherby's comment that today it's flexible, tomorrow it's not as flexible. And so that was really salient for me. And so where do we start those conversations? Because I imagine there's going to be some prevalence work that we'll need to do to begin to think about that, both inside the plan and the recommendations from our consultants, but also how do we adapt it into our VDC? And then on top of that, we're not the first people to do this. So there is lots of examples of communities that are similar size, Gainesville, for example, Charlottesville, Virginia, for example, that have move from a primary residential zoning classification into either a neighborhood zoning or something else. And so those are my pieces to move over. Because while I agree with councilmember dish that the council requested, resolutions are coming, those fill, ethereal maybe, is the word that I want to use here. They were some very specific, they were super specific. They have to go through some processes to get to this table. As noted by yourself, that there are conversations that are happening not at staff level, but that are happening at the deputy city administrator, at the community services director, and then at the planning director, but with an expected end date of December 2025. So somewhere between the ethereal stuff now and the more specific stuff in December 2025, the expectation is that they'll be significantly advanced mixed use neighborhoods, I do think is being discussed.

So somewhere between the ethereal stuff now and the more specific stuff in December 2025, the expectation is that they'll be significantly advanced mixed use neighborhoods, I do think is being discussed. I think now is actually the point in the comprehensive plan where I've started to see discussions like that pop up more. There are going to be a series of more intensive and focused conversations with small business owners about integration into neighborhoods. There was a proposed concept about how to introduce more commercial units, maybe accessory commercial units, if that could work at Ann Arbor by some council members. Staff were asked to look at that and we pass that on to our consultants to fold into the same conversation. I think that that will be present in the next steering committee meeting, which out of an abundance of transparency we have decided to broadcast because we don't want anyone to have the perception that these are excluding or deciding things on behalf of Ann Arbor Ice that they don't have access to. So if you would like to tune into that steering committee meeting, you certainly can. Those details will be posted by manager Leonard and administrative staff when they're available and then the subcommittee for the comprehensive plan from the planning commission. I would encourage to push for these items and understanding how they get folded into that process. I have insight into that, but I do not have as many details, I think, as you are interested in tonight. Sure. I don't know that I'm specifically interested in anything other than putting it on the agenda. Because if it's there then at least there's some indication that we're moving in that direction. And thanks for the feedback that you just noted. I would also like to vote for moving the lot size in the setback review into this year as well because I feel like those are because there's a lot of UDC stuff that we're going to have to do. They are functionally started this year because they are part of the comprehensive plan. They just are not being worked up by staff in detail. But if these existed in 2024. Yeah, they would say, discussion, where do I have that? Sure. Yeah. Because I. Right. And I don't know if that's at ORc or special and indicate they're part of the comprehensive plan that were put here. Yeah. Other thoughts? So to summarize, I think you would like to see mixed use neighborhoods, lot size setback review and bike parking requirements or. Yeah, high school parking requirements in particular. Whatever looking for. There is some zoning or some regulations around adding cargo bikes to our development process, that there are at least some spots created. Like we have the class a, class b, class c. Is there a new class d that speaks to a cargo bike so that people can have that inside their developments? Got it. From my point of view, without any justification for what I'm asking for, 100%. This links onto two things that Commissioner Weitz just said that. So in our, and the rest of the ORC should correct me if I got this wrong, but I feel like in our last conversation about simplification, unzoning, there's two different things that are part of that. One is like zone collapse. And effectively the sense was that that is a, that is an after comprehensive plan conversation. There's some work that we kind of looked at like what might make sense but work that, that is a bigger thing. So that's part of the conversation. The other thing was what are really complicated sections that could be simplified. And I thought that one of the way too many pages was about transportation, like the non motorized transportation and also like the multipliers for EV charging. And we won't even require, we don't require parking anymore. And so it's a massive complicated table. And so I think that that, like, I think that that might be the opportunity to kind of think about, okay, how do we simplify this so that you don't have to think about what all, like, it doesn't have to change with the use. Right. The multiplier doesn't change with the use, but also that we get the things that we want. Right. And I was thinking about that again with the pud that we just had, because we have these sub rules. So in the R table, there's ABCD. And then we just heard that if the building exceeds a certain length, you have to add so much to the setback. And I was like, let's just get a red line and go through that and go through this and go through that. Because they could have come in under our core e without that restriction, and then they don't have to do anything. It's just like, see you later. It's by. Right. Just get it zoned that and build it. So I don't. So to that point, all of the zones. Zoning simplification. I don't know that, like, of what will survive. I was left with a sense that, like, um. There's part of this that we definitely know that we're not gonna bite off now. Sure. But there's another part of it that maybe there's some really simple things that's Sarah Hammerschman, I think, committed to. Like I did have. I've done anything striking things through, but I. But I thought that the section that's on transportation might be the thing. And so that that could almost be merging, almost emerging of those two things, of the transportation, like transportation.

I don't know that we can build up, bring it up to 2024, but I think there's part of that that started. And there's a lot of things on here, too. I'm just looking. Is there anything else we can cross off in 2020? I think that the specific things about rezoning, like north Main and felt residential, that should be off this list entirely for 2025. I would vote this is 2025 plus. So this is just everything that had been on a previous work plan that wasn't. Yeah. Like we do with the CIP. Like, so the rezone, main and Filch. I just feel like that that's been on there so, so, so long. And that if we can't collapse zones, I mean, I feel like that's the thing that needs to come out of the comp plan. Okay. If we need to wait for that, I vote that one off the island. Could you clarify again what is the post comp plan section? What does that mean, that section? I think that's just like we tackle it after the comp section. That's how I understood it. Yeah. Q 420 25 to 2026 is, I think Con plan's supposed to be done in Q three, Q four next year. So in what respect are you making it special by peeling those things off and saying these conversations should happen not a la carte, but together as part of a comprehensive implementation of the comprehensive consolidated effort. So it's kind of like the category of 2025 plus is. This is a stew of stuff like we don't know when we're going to get to. Which it makes sense, I think, to pull some things out of there that people are passionate about and that are really closely aligned to our goals. And the post comp plan things might have at once time been in 2025 plus, but they've been pulled out because those are the things that we anticipate, their first acting quickly, their first out after the comp, or they interrelate and it would be most responsible to think about them together. For example, if we start to change lot sizes, it should be in concert with consistent consolidating our zones. And that would be if we're going to undertake such a large effort, it would make the most sense to do those together. If we were going to consolidate zones, which would have the implication of updating zoning maps in the city and changing neighborhood property character, that is something that really should be done comprehensively as part of a citywide zoning update recommendation. So that these are reasons why some of these things were put in that spot is because the conversation for many of these, yes, in some cases has already started or is being distilled in different ways, but there isn't necessarily an emerged recommendation that staff can take and start to craft ordinance updates around or something that is more fine tuned. You could just as easily take this and give it a little prefix that says, you know, comp plan and put it it under 2024 and mark it all discussion. I just don't think that it will result in different outcomes for what you see at this table. I think it will just put it in a different category. Yep. But I think what I, the message that I'm getting is the way you listed it, you're flagging it as a priority. You think plan, we've been told by the planning commission that you would like to address these things as part of the comp plan because they are important. If this list doesn't reflect very well those things, then we can adjust that. And again, I would encourage the participants of the subcommittee to bring this up specifically as expectations and to talk through this list, which we can put on an agenda later this year and modify again, if you desire. So this seems almost less like post comprehensive plan than like comprehensive plan. Should address the following. And my understanding would be that a lot of these things are going to be the core crux and thought process during that plant and it's really taking the action to implement. Right. And actually executing on these things happen as soon as I compliment, because I think we're going to see what iterations of the plan, you know, q one, Q two, I think next year as well. So these are the topics that we expect to be addressed and then we will execute on them before we call it comprehensive plan. But I think manager Leonard suggested post comprehensive plan because that's when they would likely be adopted. Right. And so we could strike. No, no, no. It's not confusing. It's not, that's not the issue. I think for me the issue is the comp plan doesn't change the UDC. Right. And, but we talk about it from my experience as if it does.

The actual changes to the UDC are text amendments, correct, that somebody proposes. And the way that I think it works is it starts either at the table, we ask staff, we want to change this thing in the UDC, then it goes to ORC, then ORC has a conversation about it, and then there's a staff presentation, and then we discuss it and vote on it. We're going to have anywhere between 102 hundred text amendments unless you decide to put them all together in a big package that has to come through this table and then go to city council. It's going to go through two public hearings. No, three public hearings, right? One here, two there, and then it's going to be voted on and adopted. So when I am talking about a lot size change, we know we're going to have to look at, for instance, the residential zoning map. We have a lot of different lots zones. We're gonna have to say what do we want in these lot zones? How do we want that to look? The comp plan is going to say we want to build these kinds of neighborhoods. So that's going to give direction to that. But somebody is going to have to say it's 1200 across all of these zoning categories, and then we discuss it, debate it, and then vote on it and then move it forward. So that's the thing that I am trying to highlight when I hear comp plan that's just going to give us a document that guide us. But it's not actually, and I've asked this every single time we've talked about the comp plan, are the consultants going to provide us a list of text amendment recommendations? And I've been told, so please correct me if I'm wrong, that that is not going to happen. They are not going to finish the comp plan and then give us a packet of text amendments that we can start to work through and adopt. We are going to have to generate that. And by we I think I mean staff, but maybe not. I was just going to say I think all of that is right. I don't think there's any. Maybe I'm just reading this spreadsheet differently. I don't think there's anything here that counters what you're saying. No, no, no. Just for clarity so that maybe if there's anything, any way we could make it more clear. I understand everything under that list to basically be a pull down menu that's being inserted in the left. Whenever we get that, whenever the comp plan is done, like once the comp plan is done, then all of this stuff gets slotted in here. We just don't know when that is. I don't. I. Right, I hear you. So maybe it's the word that you are saying. I don't know that it's going to follow that way. So what I'm highlighting with what I'm asking for is we know some of these things are coming and they require UDC text amendments. So put them in the. Why can't we get started on that now? I just do not understand why we cannot get started on that one part of that answer. I mean I was just thinking the other day about collapsing in our districts, but I feel like I'm prejudging the confine process if I were to attempt it. And that's the most simple, easy to bite off thing I can take that table and I say 1414 hundred. 1414 hundred, 6666. I don't know that that's where the cop plan process is gonna land. So I'm gonna do that work that's gonna take me time and then I'm gonna choose some time here and then in a year I'm gonna get the cop plan back and I'm gonna wasted that time and I'd rather not do that. Unless you hear from city council that they want the increase of density across the whole residential district and the consultants have already said we're going to have to increase this density across the entire residential process. Oh, I'm not trying to shortcut it. I'm just trying to start it that there isn't, hey, let's be efficient about this because it'll take time to generate. It's going to take three years. I certainly understand that you're looking to be efficient with kind of the execution of the comp plan. And so let's prep. But there is, again, this kind of, like, we're presupposing specific outcomes when we, like, we need to let that process play out. Sure. And I maybe lot size was the wrong example for that. Yeah, I suppose. Also, this is a function also of staff capacity. And I think it behooves us to listen to the department that's been down like three people when they say, hey, this is what I think is reasonable for us to really chew up because they don't want to rush this through and half ass this thing any more than we do, and we want to make sure that the staff has had time to process, et cetera. Well, I never said that this was reasonable for staff. This is stretching us. We have backfilled two positions, as you know, Charlie said, but, you know, with all due respect to Julie and Mariana, they're just getting the ropes, you know, underneath them. And it takes our existing staff time, same pool of people who do all this stuff, who process every petition that comes to you.

It takes their time to carefully train up newer staff who, although they may have other work experience, they're new to working in city government in some cases, and specifically in city planning, specifically in the city of Ann Arbor, with our UDC, with our quirks, with our different departments. It is something that, frankly, just requires a lot of patience. I wish that I could fast track some of this work myself, but it is daunting to think about how we will manage even the consultant labor that may go into some of the consultant resolutions. I have concerns about how realistic the proposal in front of you is, so you can add whatever you like. I just can't promise more staff capacity because. Because you had it. No, thank you for that feedback. And I think it's really important for us to listen, to say, hey, and I certainly want to be as efficient as possible and understand that these text amendments will take time. To me, the ones that are most glaring are the city council resolutions. As you said, we don't know how many drop downs there are when you unclick and unbundle exactly again, somehow have 20. So again, the choice in front of us, there's four options. We can just say, let's live with the 2023 one, not make modifications. I don't think anybody doesn't sound like people want that. We can amend this. I hear support on Commissioner Weich's part to increase spiking mixed use neighbors. We think that this is actually kind of a stretch in its current state. I'm inclined to say we accept the 2024 in its current format. That's kind of where my head is at. Again, four options. Adopt 23, 24, amend it or reject it altogether. And then it comes back to us and we address it in June, essentially. So I invite other people's thoughts. I mean, and again, this doesn't have to be, you know, a unanimous thing either. There can be, but we do have to talk about whether we adopt this tonight or kick it back. So I invite others thoughts. Are we voting on the options? There's not a. Was there. Oh, there was a resolution. Yes. So it's a yes or no. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So we'd be voting to accept this, right? Unless somebody introduces a motion to that. I'm good with this for the record. Hearing all concerns and hearing all that. So any other further discussion on this with that, if there's no motions to amend, it doesn't look like there'd be support. So no one wants to find they have no support on the table. Table. With that, I will move it to a voice call. This is the proposed city Planning Commission motion to adopt the 2024 to 2025 city Planning Commission work program in its current format with no changes mix. Kelly, let me know. Voice votes? Yeah. It can just be all in favor or any of those. It doesn't need to be rolling. Okay. All in favor, say aye. Any opposed? Motion passes. We can propose amendments to this, right? No, no, no. I thought I heard Kleiner Kelly earlier say, like in subsequent meetings, if we decide that there is capacity or there is a specific, discrete proposal, that makes sense, and if we can affect, we can do that. For example, the 611 working session has room on it to discuss. The seven nine working session has room on it. I thought those were places on church eleven. Yeah, exactly. June 11. Yeah. Yeah. We thought you were talking addresses, addresses. My extension June 11 working session or the July. I don't have. Usually we try to put the pre pud petition applications, or then there's sometimes special requests from other departments that come up that we try to save space. I don't like to put too much more than two items on a working session agenda, but we definitely can. We could also put it on a regular session agenda, although we like the this happened to be a lighter meeting in terms of the agenda item, so I felt comfortable putting it on to allow time for discussion. As folks have pointed out, it's still only 949. The lot size piece wasn't a hypothetical. I mean, what's that? The lot size thing was not hypothetical. I was thinking, no, no, it's not a hypothetical, but I couldn't. But the thing, the reason I'm asking the question is if it turns into an idea that has like that doesn't feel connected to the plan process in some way, then that was the point of the question. Yep, gotcha. And you can come back at a working session. So please talk with staff or, you know, email the rest of the commission to try to get it on the working session agenda.

I'm not sure why because I've been sharing screen and looking at participants and definitely touching the screen. We've had a lot of challenges here in the basement, so hopefully this is the last meeting where we do this, but unfortunately due to that there are currently no rejoined attendees. I don't remember the last time I looked. I think we were down to maybe three people about 20 minutes ago, so I'm not sure if they organically dropped off or I'm very sorry. We're eliminating difficulties. Thank you. If there is no one that would or no one currently on, then we will close public comment. Please do email or feel free to reach out to us. We're moving on to agenda items item twelve. Is there any commission proposed business lot size? Any. Well, for example, if you'd like to see your work, if you would like to see a dedicated work program discussion later this summer, or revisit this so that you don't feel like this was just pushed on you in May, you are now in keeping with your bylaws, which is great. And we could have moved, move this to July or August before and you wouldn't have been in keeping with your bylaws. So now you're in keeping with your bylaws, and we can reschedule it if you'd like to revisit it. And I'm happy to put that on an agenda for more discussion if the planning commission directs me to do so. Thank you. And if our new staff ends up getting up to speed really quickly or finding certain things that they really want to work on, nor we could move things up through staff, you're like, that's not going to happen. There's too much to do. I prefer changing points. It might make sense to do it when we get some more specificity around the council directives, because some of them probably align with some of the things that we've been wanting to do for a while.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so the prioritization should come sooner, right? Between now and then. Oh, we really need to clarify that. I do have one clarification. Well, the work breakdown, the clarity, there's a lot of which I'd like to. To ask. Yes, it's back to the commission work program. It had the bylaw updates in chapter eight amendments. As a first reading at city council for yesterday, I don't think that took place. That definitely didn't take place. Okay, so if we could just get an update for that, because that affects our quorum. Not quorum, but majority votes was what we were considering there. Yeah, I will check on that. I'm not sure why it would have been delayed, but I'll check on that. I mean, they had nine public hearings, but I don't think that was one of them. I listened to all nine. Weren't they enjoyable? They were. Thank you, commissioner Weich. Sure. I moved that.

So I'll reopen public comment, if that's okay. Sure thing. Give me 1 second to pull my clock back up. Thank you, Kayla. Sorry. No problem. Yeah. Diane, you have permission to address the planning commission? I am. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. I'm calling in about the planning meeting. Intent to talk about 25. 25 Ann Arbor Saline road. Is that open for discussion? I emailed. I know that the neighborhood I live in has multiple people opposed to the rezoning to change it from office to residential for a five story apartment complex indicated that we are supposed to come to this meeting when you announced that the agenda was changing. I know other people called in this neighborhood, which is right across the street from Whole Foods. Many of us are opposed to putting an apartment complex on a road that cannot support more traffic. Last year, we had a car go into a sinkhole. And how will the changes with that many apartment complexes be corrected to ensure that we all can share the road? Plus school housing with all the apartment complexes going in at Briarwood Mall and within a mile or two of that location, is it, do we need more businesses or do we need more apartments? Does that conclude your comments? Yes, thank you. Thank you. I believe that's. I'll just check to see if anybody else. Councilmember Desch. Yeah, I mean, could we just clarify for the benefit of this caller that that item was not on tonight's meeting agenda? Yes, there's been a lot of confusion in the community about that because the community meeting was just held and people felt that we would be talking about it tonight. And I think this color indicated she thought there had been a change to the agenda that might have taken that off. So. Yes, thank you. Can you. Yes. Okay, good. Yeah. No, thank you. We're not reviewing that item tonight. I think it's just a capital improvements prioritization plan or is that correct? I can share for the benefit of that caller and all commissioned that. 22 71 south state was supposed to be on tonight's agenda for a pre pud submission conference, and that was withdrawn by the petitioner because they were not yet ready to present their concept. So we left the other agenda item, which is Kayla's item 25 25 in Arbor Saline Road, as the council member stated. I believe that they, they requested labels in the middle of last month to send out their citizen participation meeting. And so. Sounds like that was recently held. I don't have the date right in front of me, but they have not yet formally submitted a project with the city. So we don't have anything beyond the concept and the exchange of labels for their intent to proceed for that project. That's the status of that. Gotcha. Thank you, Mick's Kelly for the clarification. With that, let's move on to Miss Coleman's presentation. Hi, Kayla. Hello. Thank you, chair and commission, for having me this evening. My name is Kayla Coleman.

With that, let's move on to Miss Coleman's presentation. Hi, Kayla. Hello. Thank you, chair and commission, for having me this evening. My name is Kayla Coleman. I'm the capital projects asset manager here at the city of Ann Arbor in the systems planning unit. So my role is, a primary part of my role is to prepare the capital improvements plan, and this planning commission is the decision making body for approval of that plan. And so I'm here tonight to talk a bit about the scoring process for capital projects. Typically, you've seen me come in the fall or December or even January for the plan adoption. But we've talked over the last couple of years about doing some updates to our scoring measures and how capital projects are evaluated. So as this is sort of the off season of CIP planning, this is a good time. Works out well for me to come and share some more detail and share some information about work that staff are pursuing right now and to get some input from commissioners that can help guide this process. So with that, let me share my screen. Please stop me if you aren't seeing my slides, but I think you should be and I will get these controls moved out of my way. Yes, we can see your slides, Kayla. Great. Thank you. All right, so many of you have seen this graphic before about capital improvement planning process, but I'm going to for the benefit of any members of the public following along or any new commissioners, I do want to briefly overview what all is entailed in the CIP process and then talk a little more about where we'll focus tonight. So capital improvement planning includes a couple of major steps that are identifying potential projects. So thinking about project needs and scope, prioritizing projects based on what we refer to as strategic value. And I'm going to talk a little more in some later slides about what we mean by that and then programming projects, considering the prioritization rank of that value, the budget, considering also budget estimates and funding sources and funding availability. Thinking also about staff capacity and project coordination. So with all of those different things to consider, staff put together a proposed capital improvements plan and then bring that forward to this commission, planning commission as the decision maker. And ultimately, what planning commission is looking for is whether or not this proposed CIP aligns with the priorities that are identified in the city's comprehensive plans. So thinking about whether or not we're achieving those goals that we've set out to achieve and doing this work in this capital work in a way that brings the most value to achieve the progress on those plans and then for another piece of the puzzle and how this fits into the bigger picture. The capital improvement plan is what informs the city's capital budget, and city council makes the decisions on budget approval, and that's where dollars actually get allocated for project implementation. So we'll definitely have plenty of time for questions at the end, but just hopefully that helps to give an overview of the process where we're going to focus. I am going to continue stepping through each of these steps in more detail in the following slides, but we're really focusing around project prioritization we have a defined process for that that we've been using for many, many years. And while we're not overhauling that process right now, we are looking at what are those scoring measures? Are the measures that we're currently using working well, or can we make improvement? And that's our focus for this discussion. So also, just in context for what all goes into developing the capital improvements plan, it's a fairly involved process. During those initial steps of project identification, prioritization and programming. Those steps include over 30 meetings, including more than 50 different staff across the organization. That totals to more than 75 hours of meeting time. And that not, I'm not talking staff time there either. So each of those meetings may have either a couple of staff, a half a dozen staff, or even a dozen included in some of these larger asset groups where we're talking about more projects and more of our city assets. That takes place primarily in September and October. And these statistics that I'm pulling right now are what I have planned for this fall's CIP process. I won't get into the detail here, but as many of you are familiar, we do what's called a full plan update every other year. This year will be one of those full plan updates. And then in the off years, it's a modification, which is a much more abbreviated process and fewer meetings, less staff commitment. And that's part of the reason why we use that model, is that makes it a little more manageable for staff to keep up with and to have the capacity to put this all together. We have 14 asset groups. So asset groups are the different where the project areas, similar types of projects are grouped together. So things like street projects would be one asset group, water projects, sanitary sewer projects, airport projects, parking projects. These are just some examples. And that includes, in total, nearly 500 projects in the current six year planning cycle. And that's over $1 billion worth of funding that would be needed within that six year period, and 50 or more potential funding sources. And by funding sources, these includ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Ann Arbor", "insights": [{"observation": "They requested labels in the middle of last month to send out their citizen participation meeting.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We are looking at what are those scoring measures?

And that's over $1 billion worth of funding that would be needed within that six year period, and 50 or more potential funding sources. And by funding sources, these include different millages that the city has. This includes utility funds like we have a water fund, a sanitary sewer fund, stormwater, etcetera. We have grant funding coming in so many different sources that we're balancing and evaluating as potential ways to fund the work that needs to get done. So again, this is to give you context and to give you an idea of the work that goes into this, the thought, the involvement and how we get to that plan when we bring it to this commission for consideration. So again, we identify projects, lots of projects get proposed. The first step is think broadly. Think about all of the needs. Consider the condition of our assets. Consider maintenance history. Think about staff knowledge, where we have staff seen needs for asset improvements, or the condition needs repair. We also refer to city planning documents as a source for project identification. There are other prioritization models that fit in and are paired with the CIP process, and of course, community input as well. Projects are sometimes identified through outreach from individual residents, individual community members. Also through the engagement that happens in our broader planning efforts, those also can be sources of project identification. So through all these means, we get a lengthy list of potential projects. And then here's our focus today about scoring and assessing strategic value. So, in order to do this, each asset group has a set of defined strategic priorities, is what they're referred to as the strategic priorities and the strategic objectives to meet those priorities. And so the example here on the slide is showing you the active transportation strategic value scorecard. And those priorities are defined as physical safety, regulatory and policy, compliance, access and mobility, funding and coordination with other projects and agencies. And some of these, at least, access and mobility has defined objectives beneath it. And some of the other priorities do not. But for each of these, the goal here in evaluating strategic, are measuring the strategic value of each project is to try to determine how well that project will achieve community goals. So we want to define these scorecards in a way that are reflective of the goals of this community and this organization. And that will allow us to then compare one project to another, looking at its overall value. What value do we expect one project to bring compared to another project? And then that would inform us to schedule the projects earlier that will bring greater value. So that's the theory behind it. And then you can see a next step after we've identified these priorities, these objectives. The numbers in the bubble with the different percentages are the weights. Those are the weights that are allocated to each of those priorities. But it's not defined arbitrarily. The method that's used is called pairwise comparison, and it's meant to take some of that potential bias out of it so that we don't walk into this and just say, okay, physical safety is the most important thing. That's got to have the greatest weight. That does turn out to be the case here. You see 31% for physical safety is weighted the highest. But that was determined after a pairwise comparison process, where we looked at each priority in comparison to each other, each objective in comparison to each other, and use these relative comparison scales to think about which one is most important for the city of Ann Arbor to invest in right now, projects that enhance safety or projects that provide a great amount of funding, funding benefit, or have secured funding or projects that coordinate with other agencies. So we've made those comparisons. We've established weight. The next step is to define how we will measure each project, to describe the definitions along the scoring continuum that will be used to assess each project. So, for physical safety, we have defined whether we're looking for whether or not the project is going to make minor improvements to transportation safety, or is that project going to have a significant impact, or is the project driven entirely by transportation safety needs? And then on a couple of the notches along the continuum, you also see reference to whether the project is a tier two improvement in the defined transportation safety plan or a tier one improvement. So there's some criteria, scoring criteria, that are more objective. We can look at the map in the transportation plan, the vision zero plan. We can see whether or not this project is part of that tier one or tier two corridors, and that gives us a very clear answer of where we should drop the sliding bar when we're scoring a project. But other times, it's not as black and white. We rely on staff discussions and conversation about what is expected to be included within a project to assess whether or not we think that's having a minor impact or a significant impact, or really if safety is at the root of why we're", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Ann Arbor", "insights": [{"observation": "We have grant funding coming in so many different sources that we're balancing and evaluating as potential ways to fund the work that needs to get done.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "So again, we identify projects, lots of projects get proposed.

We rely on staff discussions and conversation about what is expected to be included within a project to assess whether or not we think that's having a minor impact or a significant impact, or really if safety is at the root of why we're doing this project. And we try to be, we look to be consistent across similar types of projects. So we may look at all the sidewalk projects together and say, okay, generally, we think that sidewalk improvements at least make a minor improvement to safety, but then looking on a case by case basis, are there, is there other data available that would tell us that a sidewalk in a certain area brings even greater safety, potential safety improvements, and so we can customize the score per each project area, looking at them individually. And so that's an example, just talking in more detail of how we would score on that one objective. I won't talk through all of them in such detail to keep us moving, but you get the idea of how this scoring process works. We use those high, medium, and low desirability definitions to help us measure the impact that an individual project is expected to make. And then ultimately, this produces a rank ordered list of all of our projects and their comparative overall benefit. So I'm going to review some of the steps that go into the CIP process. So, again, we've talked about identifying potential projects. Lots of potential projects get identified. We then score and prioritize those. So using those scoring criteria that we just talked about, that gives us a prioritization rank. And that goes from the highest strategic value to the lowest. But we don't, we're not able to use, to always use that complete list of projects as produced from top to bottom. There are other constraints we have to think about. So sometimes the project costs and the revenue forecasts come into play. Staff and contractor capacity can come into play and may impact the number of projects we're able to pursue in a particular year of our capital plan. And then there are other external pressures to think about as well. Project coordination is one we talk a lot about. The most straightforward example that we always use is road resurfacing and an underground utility project. We want to maximize our efficiency. We want to take advantage of the opportunity to not just repair the road surface, but to repair and improve the infrastructure that's underground if it's needed. So that project coordination can mean that if a road, say a road condition puts it at a very high strategic value, and it appears that that project should come very soon. But if the underground utilities rank a little lower, they're still needed, but they're not at the very top of the list, then there may need to be some shuffling where in order to get those projects in the same year of the capital plan, the street may wait a little longer, or the underground utility may come a little sooner. And then we can maximize efficiency and do those together. Because we never want to lay down fresh pavement and then come back through shortly after to make an improvement on the underground utility. There are also competing policy priorities that may come into play. So we've got lots to think about, lots of goals as defined in different comprehensive plans, different council policy that may be set. And we've got to balance all of this and come up with a proposed plan that we can bring forward to planning commission. So all of this is sort of to try to help paint the picture of how that plan is developed, how the scoring process helps us. But it doesn't give us a final verdict of we can't take that rank order as is. We do have to have conversations among staff and think about these other aspects and other factors that come into play. So, next couple of slides, and I'm in my last couple of slides here, but I want to talk about the work that we're doing right now. As I mentioned, we're in the off season. We're able to focus in on these scoring updates. And part of that is specifically looking at equity and sustainability. So these are values that are reflected in some way in many of our asset group scoring measures currently, but a lot has happened since the last time these scoring measures were established. So we've got an office of organizational equity that was established in 2022. The a 20 plan was adopted in June of 2020, and the Office of Sustainability existed prior to 2020, but it's continued to grow and many new hires have come in with new perspectives, new ideas that can help bring more people to the table thinking about the best ways to measure sustainability, to measure equity. So we're taking this opportunity now to look specifically at those important values and see how they're reflected in the asset groups now and make some proposals about how they could be improved upon. We're looking so we're looking at those values across all asset groups. We're also going to look at the rest of the scoring criteria holistically for each asset group. You can see that there are some groups with stars next to them. We adopted a new vip software called Allevant in 2020, and when we did that, those groups went through a process to update their scoring criteria.

We're looking so we're looking at those values across all asset groups. We're also going to look at the rest of the scoring criteria holistically for each asset group. You can see that there are some groups with stars next to them. We adopted a new vip software called Allevant in 2020, and when we did that, those groups went through a process to update their scoring criteria. And the other eight asset groups did not get scoring updates. They continued to use a more historic scoring process that had been around for a couple of decades. So they're definitely due for a fresh look. We're going to look at all of those scoring criteria and that will make some adjustments and hopefully improve the way we're selecting projects. We'll then rescore all of those existing projects using new criteria. So that'll be a major effort. As I said, we've got over 400, really closer to 500 existing projects. So we'll be looking at incorporating these new scoring measures. And here's a look at some of the work so far. So equity is currently measured in different asset groups, primarily by these two criteria, either percentage of households in poverty within the project location, or the project's ability, I should say, and or the ability to improve accessibility considering ADA access and whether the project provides limited or full universal access. So we've had some discussions with staff today. We are, we are working through this process actively. I'm coming to you as we are digging into it, and I don't have something to present to you of what we've come up with yet, but what I can tell you about discussions to date is that we're looking at the Washtenaw County Opportunity Index, the Vision zero transportation equity needs map. So trying to think about these tools that already exist and how they could be used to leverage those to measure equity for particular projects. Also looking broadly at how does a project resolve an inequity gap? So perhaps there's a historic inequity. Does this project contribute towards resolving that, or does it further exacerbate an equity issue? Also, considering housing supply and the desirability to live in Ann Arbor, we know that housing is an important topic for this community. It's an important focus of the comprehensive transportation plan. So we're considering whether or not that should be leveraged in the equity assessment for a particular project, or is that better represented more holistically as more generally, I guess, as part of the inequity gap discussion and also looking at accessibility. So we had accessibility reflected in a few asset groups previously, but looking more broadly at how that applies across all of them. For sustainability, the current scoring criteria have used sustainability framework goals. There are some that use a 20 goals. And then there are other references that don't name necessarily a certain policy document. It doesn't name the framework or a 20, but it references protection of natural systems. Whether or not a project expands transportation options through active transportation and transit, whether a project reduces energy load, adds new trees, or reduces flooding. So these are all criteria that show up in some way across the asset groups. And so far, the discussion in the sustainability teams has really focused around reflecting a 20. So that being our primary guiding document for sustainability and wanting to align how we score projects with the way that the a 20 strategies are represented. So with that, I'd love to open it up for questions and discussion. And here are some ideas about areas that the planning commission may want to provide input that we would certainly be very welcome and thankful for. So we're thinking about CIP scoring and how it aligns with equity, sustainability, affordability, and the work that the comprehensive plan is doing. So if you have ideas around that, that's really helpful. If you know of tools or resources that could help measure sustainability and equity, that's very helpful. We mentioned a couple already, but please share. Please share with us your background, your knowledge and expertise, and then any other general feedback that staff should be thinking about as we're moving through this process. For CIP scoring, all that is helpful. I'll return to these prompts, but the last thing I want to say is just this final overlook again at this CIP planning overview, and then timeframes, just in terms of what you can expect for the future. Remember that I'll be back at some point in the fall. That's when we do the CIP discussion and the plan adoption discussion. But before then, we'll keep you informed, certainly, of how the scoring discussions play out and make sure that you are, that the communications are shared of what these teams develop. But let me end with this slide, or I can end my screen share too, if that's easier, and I'll turn it over. Back to you, chair Lee, for discussion with the commission. Yeah. Thanks so much. Miss Coleman. Yeah. Commissioner Adams. Yeah. Thanks, Kayla, for the presentation. It was really great.

Remember that I'll be back at some point in the fall. That's when we do the CIP discussion and the plan adoption discussion. But before then, we'll keep you informed, certainly, of how the scoring discussions play out and make sure that you are, that the communications are shared of what these teams develop. But let me end with this slide, or I can end my screen share too, if that's easier, and I'll turn it over. Back to you, chair Lee, for discussion with the commission. Yeah. Thanks so much. Miss Coleman. Yeah. Commissioner Adams. Yeah. Thanks, Kayla, for the presentation. It was really great. And I apologize if you covered this, but one of the questions I had when you were talking about sidewalk gap projects is why they're. We have a scoring. My understanding is that we have a separate scoring mechanism for those projects. They also have a dedicated revenue stream. So it's not obvious to me why they would be included in your, why you would re score them or reweight them relative to other. Once they've already been scored, in other words, and they have a dedicated revenue stream stream that's earmarked, it feels like they ought to just be passed through. Right. Or they ought to be excluded from, not from the plan, but inserted in plan in order to whatever scoring. The sidewalk gap scoring metrics would demand that they be scored by instead of being re racked or re weighted through a different process. Did you cover that or did I miss something or misinterpret it? No, we didn't. We did not talk about that explicitly. And I. It's funny you say that, because as we've been having these discussions, oh, my camera's not gonna focus on it. But what I have a print out of is the sidewalk gap prioritization, scoring what their scoring system uses. And I don't know if it shows up here. I thought this slide may help us. Yeah, it does show up in one of these priorities, and I don't know offhand which one it is, where a certain number of points are allocated to the sidewalk project based on how it scores in the sidewalk gap prioritization process. And I think that your point is that there's some redundancy for sure in scoring it through this sidewalk gap system and then scoring it in the CIP act of transportation. And I think that that's something that the scoring teams will look at in more detail. It's come up already in some of the early discussions. One thing to take into consideration is that we don't have a sidewalk asset group. It's the active transportation asset group. And so that includes many sidewalk projects, but it includes other cycle track, or it could include bike parking, I think is one of them. There's maybe some people friendly street sorts of projects. There's other things in that asset group. So there's a need to define a broader scorecard of how we would measure active transportation. But I think your point, perhaps your point and something the team can consider is for those sidewalk projects, should they be exempted from this? So, yes, we need to define these for other active transportation projects that are not sidewalks. But could we say that that sidewalk prioritization system is sufficient to capture all of the priorities that need to be considered or all of the values that need to be considered? And I think it's a great point. I don't have an answer other than it's come up in early discussions and I know the team will look at that as we know. Yeah, I mean, and I would just tack onto that. I mean, I think it's sort of worse than redundancy, right. It's policy judgments that are intention and in conflict with each other. So I can't remember if the sidewalk gap scoring came through council or not, or whether it was city administrator led. But regardless, somebody sat down and said, this is the metrics by which we're going to evaluate how we score a sidewalk project and fund it and prioritize it. And then if that's true, and then we're going to then take that sausage and put it into another sausage making process and turn it into something else. We're actually turning that policy judgment on its head. We're taking a prioritization scheme that somebody thought was the right process and we're changing it. And I think it feels like they either need to be combined, merged together in a way that's coherent or, or we got to just abandon the sidewalk scoring project that we've been using. And I'll give you an example. There's a sidewalk up on sunset that was a high scoring project four years ago. It got delayed, and I've been keeping an eye on it in the capital plan, and it's been slipping. And if a project was scored high at one time through the sidewalk gap project, and it keeps slipping in the capital plan, something's amiss. Again, it'd be different if. It would be different if the funding mechanism, if the funding was being shared amongst all the priorities, then you'd have to wait it against these other projects. But the funding stream is dedicated, so it got a high score at one point and it keeps moving. Right. And it should have years ago. So that prompted me to ask, and it's just something to keep an eye on because it does feel like we're fighting each other a little bit on this one. Absolutely. And I'll say one comment just to keep in mind on like with the sunset sidewalk as an example, that score is very high both through the sidewalk gap prioritization and the CIP prioritization. And it was programmed and it moved ahead and community engagement began and it was the community pushback that resulted in that not moving forward to implementation. So it wasn't a difference in outcome in the two scoring processes. I only know because I was in the community engagement role at the time to help with leading that engagement effort. That sort of gets more at external pressures, more than a difference in the prioritization systems. But I. Absolutely.

To your point about the duplication and the conflict, not just redundancy, but true conflict, to have two different systems. Absolutely. It'll be something to be explored as we look at these updates. There's no need to duplicate efforts and certainly no need to put two different scoring systems in conflict with each other. Also, just to jump in, I think that our dedicated funding stream is insufficient for all of the possible CIP projects in that category. So they're ranked and identified because there could be opportunity projects that, for example. I'm just spitballing, Kayla. You can tell me if this is real or not, but if a sidewalk gap could be addressed through another and combined through another road project or infrastructure project by that, we might already be tearing up some nearby right of way and it could be added on as a scope item. Yeah. So it's good to know that. And sometimes those things are embedded in scoring criteria to find those opportunities to combine. There is some of that. You're right, Mix Kelly, that the opportunity to gain efficiency and to minimize neighborhood disruption by doing not just a sidewalk, but maybe the street and the utility work together is all considered. But could that be reflected just in the sidewalk prioritization system itself? Perhaps. I think Mix Kelly brings up a really great point and it's something that we can again look at holistically with this asset team. Thank you, Commissioner Adams, for the good comment there. And then Commissioner Weich. Hi, Kayla. Thanks so much for coming back and talking with us about the cipher. I think I'll start with a question, and then I have an observation, and then that might lead to another question. So I think the question is, I'll start with the observation. So I observed that plat between Washtenaw and Huron River Drive got repaved, restriped a bike, infrastructure was put in, and then development commenced at Viridian and at the Avalon site, which has another name, and it's not coming to the forefront of my head right away. And then they tore up the road again because they had to upgrade the water utility that was there. And as you were walking us through this slide, you sort of specifically said, we want to avoid taking a capital improvement to, for instance, a roadway and then coming back and updating the facility underground, which then sort of negates that work. And I wonder, I think the question is, is there any coordination between the CIP and the development that is happening? Because I know that development doesn't always happen on schedule. So something may get greenlit in the CIP, but a developer is coming. And because the growth, that's what it's called, viridian and the grove, those two developments are coming. They've decided that the capacity there has to be upgraded. And this sort of ties in somewhat tangentially to our economic development initiatives that are currently happening with council, where developers are asked to bring the utility up to the highest possible use, which is something that council is going to consider maybe changing. And so just for my information, and maybe even for the publics, is there coordination across the CIP with this kind of development schedule so that we don't take a road, re asphalt it, tear it all up, and then put cement down with the asphalt? And so now the roads in these sort of jagged way, hopefully that all came through okay. Yes, that absolutely makes sense. And so what I will say is that part of. I had the graphic, sorry, I stopped my screen share so I could see everyone's face a little more. But the graphic that talked about there being over 50 staff involved in the process. And part of that are staff that are involved with development process, staff from the planning department, but also the private development team and other engineering staff that may be in conversations about site plan proposals. There's a broad representation of different staff that are involved in the CIP process who may have knowledge of a private development project that's been put forward. And if they do, that often does get brought up. If they've got knowledge of it, they're going to bring it up in the conversation as we talk through each project individually. And we will avoid scheduling a capital improvement if we can. If we can delay it until a development is going to happen and coordinate that work, then we seek those opportunities. But there are certainly times when work goes ahead through the CIP when the city is either not aware of a private development project or the private development may have appeared to have been delayed and had stalled out and then resurfaces unexpectedly. I don't, I'm not particularly familiar with what happened out at and with the viridian and gross. I can't speak to that one. As to what happened there. I don't know if there was, like a more pressing need to move that striping ahead sooner. Do you know, by chance if it was resurfaced and. Yeah, it was resurfaced and th", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Sunset Sidewalk Project", "insights": [{"observation": "Community engagement began and it was the community pushback that resulted in that not moving forward to implementation.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "CIP Projects", "insights": [{"observation": "Opportunity to gain efficiency and to minimize neighborhood disruption by doing not just a sidewalk, but maybe the street and the utility work together is all considered.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Viridian and Avalon Sites", "insights": [{"observation": "Development commenced at Viridian and Avalon site, which led to the road being torn up again to upgrade the water utility.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "CIP and Private Development Projects", "insights": [{"observation": "Coordination between the CIP and the development that is happening to avoid taking a capital improvement to a roadway and then coming back and updating the facility underground.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Sunset Sidewalk Project", "insights": [{"observation": "Community engagement began and it was the community pushback that resulted in that not moving forward to implementation.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "CIP Projects", "insights": [{"observation": "Opportunity to gain efficiency and to minimize neighborhood disruption by doing not just a sidewalk, but maybe the street and the utility work together is all considered.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Viridian and Avalon Sites", "insights": [{"observation": "Development commenced at Viridian and Avalon site, which led to the road being torn up again to upgrade the water utility.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "CIP and Private Development Projects", "insights": [{"observation": "Coordination between the CIP and the development that is happening to avoid taking a capital improvement to a roadway and then coming back and updating the facility underground.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 2037644, "chunk_end_time": 2492050, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMGDpqj5fMg", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMGDpqj5fMg&t=2037s"}, {"start": 34000, "end": 40000, "text": "ve knowledge of a private development project that's been put forward.

And then cut into all the, they did all the driveways because my church is there. So we're, we got a new driveway, a north and south one. And then about two months ago, they tore everything up right in front of the driveway and put in a bigger water utility. And then they shut off the water for the whole neighborhood. And then they put it all back. But obviously they didn't put back asphalt, they put back cement. So the road is just like, oh, wow, that seemed like a lot of money that went before, and now there's more money and maybe the developer paid for it in the city. Is, is like, this is the, the way that we get this higher cost utility. But looking at the process from the vantage point that I'm looking at it, it feels sort of out of sync in some ways. So I just want to know how that. Yeah, yeah. Well, I think the way that it's working is like, through those robust staff discussions, having lots of people involved that are in different facets of the organization, involved in private development, involved in utility conversations. The goal is that that information comes up to the surface and that we can coordinate so that we are not cutting into, firstly, paved streets. That's certainly the goal. And it sounds like this is an example where that didn't play out. I do feel pretty certain that if a developer is, if the cut is happening, for a developer to do an upside, to upsize, to serve their development, that they are bearing the cost of that work. So I think, and I hope and I can certainly follow up to confirm that that is a duplicate expense out of city dollars. But still, it doesn't change the fact that we then have fresh pavement cut into, which isn't, isn't good for the life, not only the aesthetic or the feel of the road, but it's not good for the lifespan of the pavement either. So certainly something that we try to avoid. And then an observation. I was out biking today. I was in the sort of longshore drive neighborhood and down by the Argo cascade. And we just, thanks to Commissioner Dish, we just had a developer who is going to do a development on Longshore Drive. And one of the things that it got me thinking about as I was biking through the neighborhood were multiple things. One, there's not a sidewalk that comes all the way down Longshore drive to get to the cascade. They're going to be doing a lot of development down that road. Then as you go through the neighborhood, there's not parking permitted on Saturday, Sunday and holidays from April to October, September. Commissioner Dish, you can correct me. I think this is your area, so you might know it more direct. And then it got me thinking about accessibility and transportation. So we, as far as I know, we don't have a transit connection that goes straight to the Argo cascade. And then with the parking being restricted and there being no publicly accessible sidewalks, like there's all this intersection and I don't know, like in some ways you hear me sort of grappling at the table. Over the last three years or so that we've had this conversation about, like, how, who do we highlight these things to? Is it a policy thing where we're reaching out to, to our council representatives to say, hey, did someone think about this? This development's coming. It's going to shut down this road. You can't park on the streets that are accessible and there's no public transportation. And are we aware of the accessibility for those who have mobility issues to get to sort of this treasure in the city? And how then does that come into our planning for the city? So at a, a larger level, is there conversation around these key sites being accessible? Like the Argo cascade, like the new park that's going to go in southeast Park, Bicentennial Park, I think is what it's called. And how are we thinking about that to make those sites accessible to folks through public transportation and sort of hitting our values of reducing vehicular miles traveled? So, like, who sits at the apex of all of that? So that it's not just atomized in the departments who have the direct sight or visibility to it. So someone knows about the sidewalk, someone knows about transportation, someone knows about accessibility. And then there's the capital plan that says, hey, what do we want to do in concert with the comprehensive plan for the city? And then who shepherds that to make sure that they all fall in line? Like, it's, does that question make sense? Sort of. Let me give, let me respond, and then we can go back and clarify better, because I think what comes to mind to me is that, that, that comprehensive group of 50 or more different. There's not an answer. That's one person that does this, that it's having all those voices around the table to bring up, having transportation engineering staff, transportation planning staff, representatives from the ride who are involved in the process.

That's one person that does this, that it's having all those voices around the table to bring up, having transportation engineering staff, transportation planning staff, representatives from the ride who are involved in the process. When we're talking about capital projects and the impacts of a capital project, then I think a lot of those, like, transportation impacts would come up in those discussions. There's also a lot of thought that goes into, like, detour routes and ensuring working to do a better job of maintaining accessibility for all modes of travel, not just a car detour route. I mean, that's, this is sort of outside of capital planning, but more about how work happens within the public right of way. And that's governed by a document that's called the public services standards and specifications. It's a lengthy 800 page document that we had the pleasure of publishing an update to this January. So that's what I worked on outside of CIP season. So anyway, the point is there's a lot of guidance that goes on to how work happens in the public right of way, and the routing and the maintenance of traffic for different modes of transportation has definitely come up. I've seen it in that separate discussion. But your comment relating to development, I feel like, is like, I think that what you're talking about out on, long story, is more, is that more private development focused, or is it capital work? It's private, but I think where I'm trying to go is, is this inside the comprehensive plan so that somebody is looking both long term, which is going to impact capital, the capital improvement plan, but near term as well, to say, how are we thinking about development across the city? So here we have this treasure, and I think I've heard Commissioner dish and others talk about, we didn't know that Argo Cascade was going to be as popular as it has become. So it's become this sort of southeastern Michigan gathering thing. And so that has spilled into the neighborhood. And so the neighbors weren't ready for what they call beach season, which I learned last week. So apparently we have a beach season and we're in the midst of our comprehensive plan, but you can't get to our beach through public transportation. And if you do get there somehow on public transportation, there is no accessibility for you to get to our beach. So does for me that feels like it sits in the capital improvement plan because it's the capital built infrastructure that has to be improved to make this more accessible, equitable and usable for our community. But I may be thinking about this incorrectly, and so you get to disabuse me of how I'm thinking about it and say these are all great things, Donnell. But that's not my department. The 50 people come to me with their pieces. I put it all together, I give them a product and then we execute. There's somebody somewhere else and maybe Mix Kelly can tell us or commissioner Dish, I don't know. But that's what's on my mind right now, especially as we're thinking about the comprehensive plan, which feeds into the capital improvement plan, because you're going to be looking at how we're planning to use land and that impacts what things get prioritized. And so I'm just trying to, it's more like a chicken and the egg, like where does it sit? And you're the only person that comes and talks to us. So you get all my questions, of course. No problem. Well, I am happy to open the floor to others who may have input, particularly around the comprehensive plan, which I'm not as closely involved with. I'm very peripheral of it. So whether or not that's incorporated there, I think others could better respond to than me. The one last thing I'll say, and I'm happy to come back after others have spoken if that's helpful. But I do think if there are sidewalk gaps like that, certainly I know that you're talking about a broader issue and I'm like drilling in, but what is definitely CIP is where there are sidewalk gaps. And you mentioned along Longshore that there's frontage. And I'm searching right now in the active transportation asset group and I'm not seeing something for longshore. I tried it with and without a space. So I'm going to follow up on that and see, not every sidewalk gap is in the CIP because we're trying to make a six year plan and we want to make it reasonable. We don't have enough funding to put them all in in six years, so they get filtered in progressively each year. And maybe longshore is one that didn't rate as high through the sidewalk gap prioritization system, but maybe that prioritization system should be revisited anyways. That is certainly a CIP aspect. Transit accessibility is a little outside. We do have a transit asset group, but in terms of routing and scheduling, that is more of AAATA, the ride to make those decisions. Where there are transit projects in the CIP, it's more related to transit infrastructure and not so much like scheduling and routes, but maybe there's an opportunity there. So just a quick clarification and this is just for me to help me locate where these things go. So if I'm understanding you correctly, the idea that there is no transit, a publicly accessible transit, is outside the scope of the CIP. And so that sits in someone else's space. And so the concern that we have needs to go to that", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Local Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Ensuring working to do a better job of maintaining accessibility for all modes of travel, not just a car detour route.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "You can't get to our beach through public transportation, and if you do get there somehow on public transportation, there is no accessibility for you to get to our beach.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Comprehensive plan which feeds into the capital improvement plan impacts what things get prioritized.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Transit accessibility is a little outside.

So if I'm understanding you correctly, the idea that there is no transit, a publicly accessible transit, is outside the scope of the CIP. And so that sits in someone else's space. And so the concern that we have needs to go to that person, whether it's transit, the transportation committee, or it's into the. Or commission, rather, or if it's into the comprehensive plan, to say we have these goals for reducing vehicular miles traveled in the city, but we don't have the infrastructure to make that a reality. And so who, who gets that is, I think, in my question space. And I would, I guess, I don't want to say push back, but, like, make sure we ease out. Is it infrastructure or is it routing? Like, I don't know if I could actually interject and let council member dish chime in real quick. Thanks. Sure. Yeah. I might have been too hasty, in my words. So there is a bus that runs up Pontiac trail. And so that's about. It would be the equivalent of maybe three blocks walk. I mean, to remember, Argo is in a residential neighborhood. And so, you know, our buses don't usually snake in and around residential neighborhoods so much. They go up through fare, so it's not inaccessible by public transportation. And I wanted to ask Mick's Kelly and I just looked this up. Now, the developer of longshore is putting in sidewalks along longshore. Are they going to. But it says the width of the project. So I'm not sure how to interpret that language of what the width of the project means. And I couldn't find a drawing where I could see better. Julie remembers this. Yay. It should be. It should be within their parcel limits. And I think the reason why that language would be there is the they're not offering to supply public sidewalk beyond their, beyond their project, which is, in my estimation, reasonable and typical. I just really quick on the point about public transit. Local transit stops are typically spaced about a quarter mile apart, and that would be about. Or blocks between steps. I just wanted to add that, and I'm happy to chime in with any other things that were unresolved, just push them to me. Yeah, councilmember, or, I'm sorry, Commissioner Weatherby. Yeah. So I think this is just adding some to Commissioner Weich's comment is like, longshore, yay, they're putting in a sidewalk if that development gets built. But what that should is like, oh, wow. Now we have a big gap, and it's in some ways smaller than the gap before, but now we really see that that is a problem. And I think it is very common to have this. There's several developments around me where they, you know, we required them to add a sidewalk, which is great, but now there's very obvious that there's a gap. And I don't know how those get in. Like when we add, when we add sidewalk, and then that suddenly creates a gap where before it just was a street with no sidewalks, which is a gap. But I think we look specifically at parts where you can't get from a to b, and now we see those more. And also, so that's one comment is like, how do those new developments, is it just like marked on the plan and then goes in to say, now there's a different gap because those change every year. And I just am wondering how, how those sidewalk gaps get. Are they just historical gaps and then we fill them and then it's done? Or is it that we look every year for kind of how often is like, for example, the geographic information software data updated, that type of thing. Right. Like for Longshore, if it is, if their sidewalk is put in. And then we're like, oh, wow, now there's a big gap. When does that show up? After a project is created? I can have some ideas. I'm going to defer to Caleb. Yeah, let me. I'll come in and add on, please. But there is the sidewalk prioritization team that I do not fit in on their meetings. They bring information to the CIP discussion, but they're meeting, I think, throughout the year, or I mean, certainly yearly before the CIP process to provide updates about projects that we need to add in or that additional projects to filter into our six year plan. So I do think that those are getting revisited. I did also, I did want to clarify that for longshore. What I found is it's in the Parks and recreation asset group. I forgot that about a year ago we moved parks, sidewalk, sidewalk gaps that are adjacent to park property to the parks asset group because that's how those will be funded. Those are not funded through the sidewalk millage. City property is not eligible for that millage. So the parks millage needs to fund the filling of those gaps against adjacent to park property. So that's where that sets. And that would be separate. I think that I'd need to ask more about how the prioritization team is assigning each gap. I don't know if it's because, Julie, I think what you're describing is like, there is a larger gap now, but once the development is built, you may notice the gap. It may stand out because there'll be a sidewalk in Italy. You just end, suddenly you're on a sidewalk. I think at least in this, in this case, if it is, the rest of longshore is park property, which I'm not sure if there are also other private property or if it's just the development and then the park proper", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Longshore Development", "insights": [{"observation": "The developer of Longshore is putting in sidewalks along Longshore.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The developer is not offering to supply public sidewalk beyond their project, which is considered reasonable and typical.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The addition of new sidewalks may reveal gaps in the sidewalk network, creating problems for connectivity.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Municipality/City Infrastructure Planning", "insights": [{"observation": "Transit accessibility issues are outside the scope of the CIP, complicating efforts for infrastructure improvements.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Efforts are made to prioritize sidewalk gaps adjacent to park properties through different funding sources such as the parks millage.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There is a need for revisiting the sidewalk prioritization system regularly to address newly created gaps due to ongoing development.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "AAATA (The Ride)", "insights": [{"observation": "AAATA is responsible for transit routing and scheduling decisions.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"observation": "There are public transit options available, such as a bus route running up Pontiac Trail, but residential neighborhoods may still face accessibility challenges.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Longshore Development", "insights": [{"observation": "The developer of Longshore is putting in sidewalks along Longshore.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The developer is not offering to supply public sidewalk beyond their project, which is considered reasonable and typical.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The addition of new sidewalks may reveal gaps in the sidewalk network, creating problems for connectivity.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Municipality/City Infrastructure Planning", "insights": [{"observation": "Transit accessibility issues are outside the scope of the CIP, complicating efforts for infrastructure improvements.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Efforts are made to prioritize sidewalk gaps adjacent to park properties through different funding sources such as the parks millage.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There is a need for revisiting the sidewalk prioritization system regularly to address newly created gaps due to ongoing development.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "AAATA (The Ride)", "insights": [{"observation": "AAATA is responsible for transit routing and scheduling decisions.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"observation": "There are public transit options available, such as a bus route running up Pontiac Trail, but residential neighborhoods may still face accessibility challenges.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 3120148, "chunk_end_time": 3587788, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMGDpqj5fMg", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMGDpqj5fMg&t=3120s"}, {"start": 49000, "end": 55000, "text": "n asset group.

I think at least in this, in this case, if it is, the rest of longshore is park property, which I'm not sure if there are also other private property or if it's just the development and then the park property. But the park property portion is being treated separately. It's being scored separately because that segment of that gap is going to be funded entirely differently. Those decisions are going to be outside of the comparison of other sidewalk gaps through the prioritization model. We'll see if Mick Kelly had more to add or any other direction to take that. But I think the teams are revisiting these gaps on a periodic basis. Thank you, Commissioner Weitz. So I think you're right. I think the sidewalk on, I don't know, the, or I'm going to say on the north side of Longshore goes to a park and then it cuts into the park, but it doesn't go all the way down to the cascade. And so it now makes sense because if that's inside the parks, then it has to come that way, and then on the south side, there is no sidewalk at all. And so as, as Commissioner Weatherby just indicated, there will now be one and then it will end where the, the city owns the woodlands that come up from the Argo Cascades up towards Longshore. So this, this is helpful, I think, Mix Kelly, I just like, I don't know who within the city apparatus, like, is this a conversation with Mister Delacourt where we could try to, like, if there's some time in the future, just try to understand where some of these things get raised, if not here in the capital improvements place, because I hear the very clear answer of there are people who are responsible for specific things. What I think is missing, if I could highlight it or daylight it is, there doesn't seem to be an overall driver. And I thought maybe the comprehensive plan would be that driver and the comprehensive plan sits in our space, but it doesn't sound as if the comprehensive plan is that driver. And so if I'm wrong, I'm happy to be corrected. And if I'm right, I'd love to know who, if not the comprehensive plan is the driver of how this all flows and a way to kind of reshape your question might be that the overall approval of the CIP is vested in this particular body, but that we're really more of a rubber stamp. So where is the actual rubber meets the road as far as kind of our input process and the waiting of enforcement of the capital improvement. I'm sorry, the comprehensive plan within the purview of the CIP. So just. I think it's a valid point. I also think the point about removing duplications and or conflict points is also important, but also wanted to give Commissioner mills a chance to speak. So, Commissioner wills. Great. I have a bunch of disconnected notes, and I was going to end with this, but I'm actually going to start because it picks up on the seat, picks up on the comprehensive plan, but not sidewalks necessarily. But just to think, we hear multiple times that one of the limits to growth in a particular area is that the rest of the infrastructure, and actually, a lot of the things in the cipher, the size of the water and wastewater infrastructure is a limitation to kind of what can be affordably developed. And so to that point, I'm curious, like, again, we don't have that right now, but I wanted to plant a. I don't know. You plant seeds, so plant the seed that, like, in the next time this comes up, I hope that we're thinking through, like, and maybe part of this prioritization going into the strategic values is, like, the extent to which one of the criteria are supporting growth in the areas that are like, the comprehensive plan calls for significant growth in that particular place. I assume that that's not currently really part of the process. Is that fair? Right? Yeah. I can't think of, offhand anyway. I can't think of a scoring metric we have right now that's really assessing the project's ability to support growth or development. And it's more, there may be coordination with other plans or other plan objectives. So, like, does the project contribute to meeting one of the city's comprehensive or strategic planning document goals? Like, there are broad statements like that, certainly. So you could say, like, yes, the comprehensive plan says we want to support growth, and so the project does. And so it scores that way. But growth is not called out by name. I'm just thinking that that's likely one of the, like, this is part of the regular development. And again, because there are physical infrastructure limitations to our ability to achieve the targets in the comprehensive plan, and that's current plan, not counting the plan that's underway, I just think that that's something that we should be prepared to come. And again, it can also include sidewalks and accessibility, but I think that's a key one. Now I'm going to go back to the beginning of my things, which is, first of all to say thank you. I think I've seen a CIP presentation a lot, like, many years now. This is the first, to be real honest, how the percentages are given in the. Whatever it's called. Let's pair wise comparison. Yeah.

And the strategic value score card. Right. Like, where those numbers come from has always been a mystery to me. And I, as a recovering engineer, like, I like numbers. Right. On the other hand, I know that numbers can be used to cook the books and lie and, like, they can say whatever you want them to. So. So how that happens and, like, this idea of the pairwise comparison, I don't know that I've heard that before. So thank you. Sure. My. I want to say, though, that, like, really? So much like, yes, there's lots of ways that projects can get on, and there are. I don't want to say gatekeepers, but, like, there. There can be things that are left off or missed and similarly, like, how kind of scores are assigned. But honestly, it's this numbers thing that suggests science and suggests, like, that. I'm just. I think that that's one of the things that, like, how things move up and down the list has been a real, like, black box. And I'm really happy to understand this. To understand it. But. But all of those things are really policy priorities. Like, getting back to where Commissioner Adams started us off. Like, that is a policy statement about what of these values, like, how much one matters more than the other. I'm curious in each of. I understand if I took your presentation right, that each of the kind of groups, asset management groups. That's the right word. Like, it's comprised of various individuals. But I'm curious about how diverse in terms of, like, functionally and, like, across. Across staff those groups are. And I am going to give the university example, like, if you put, again, a bunch of engineers in a room to, say, rate the priorities in terms of funding, I would imagine that they're going to come up with different things than if you put a whole bunch of social scientists together. And so this is why we try to say, like, let's make sure everybody's in the room. And so I'm curious about the extent to which sustainability staff, or our equity, like, equity staff are in every single conversation and how their votes count in those pairwise comparisons. Sure. So it is meant to be very cross departmental, interdisciplinary groups. It's not a group of engineers, like the 50 plus that I mentioned. The next thing I could do to throw another bubble on that slide is to add up how many different. We don't even usually call them departments, but units or service areas are involved in the process. I actually think I had a slide in the earlier presentation that showed all the puzzle pieces, and that's really showing the breadth. But I pulled up one just as an example to take a look. But we've got engineering staff, planning staff. We have public work staff. Sustainability sits on, I think, every asset group. There's at least one sustainability representative. There has not been an equity representative in the past, but the equity office, again, has only existed since 2022. And last year in 23, we were doing a plan modification, so we didn't revise those groups. This year, as we're already starting to meet with the equity team to talk about scoring, they've said they'd like to be part of the. Be more involved in this process. I don't know if they're going to show up to every scoring discussion, but I bet that they will be. They will have someone on each asset group. So there are park representatives, different, you know, stormwater management planning reps. Like, it's. It's pretty widely covered, and it's not. I think you may. I don't know if you use the word vote or if that's just where my head went, but it is not a voting system where sustainability gets one vote for where they want the slider bar, and equity gets one vote and the engineers get one vote. It's not that scientific. It is a discussion, and I facilitate that discussion, and I have it on the screen, and I require that people come into the meeting in person, unless if we're in a heightened level of the pandemic, and we truly can't. But I want to see people there. I want to know their body language and their reactions, and I try to, if people aren't speaking up from a certain area, I call that out so that we can really get a lot of voices and where that slider bar should land. So when I was talking about this recently with the equity team, and they're new to the process, so they're learning about it, and they said, okay, so it's the loudest voice wins. And. And I said, that's one way you could think about it, but that is truly not the goal here. And as someone who spent twelve years in community engagement before doing CIP, I really do try to facilitate that in a way where we are reaching some level of agreement or talking through it if we're not getting agreement, to find the right spot for that project, to score okay. And so the pair wise comparisons that you were talking about, too, are not. Each individual is doing that. And then we're averaging each individual. We are coming, like, which of these things is more. Yeah. Tell me why this one is more. Tell me why that one's more. Yeah. It's a discussion that is helpful. Again, this is.

So when I was talking about this recently with the equity team, and they're new to the process, so they're learning about it, and they said, okay, so it's the loudest voice wins. And. And I said, that's one way you could think about it, but that is truly not the goal here. And as someone who spent twelve years in community engagement before doing CIP, I really do try to facilitate that in a way where we are reaching some level of agreement or talking through it if we're not getting agreement, to find the right spot for that project, to score okay. And so the pair wise comparisons that you were talking about, too, are not. Each individual is doing that. And then we're averaging each individual. We are coming, like, which of these things is more. Yeah. Tell me why this one is more. Tell me why that one's more. Yeah. It's a discussion that is helpful. Again, this is. It's nice to, like, see behind the curtain a little bit. I'm just gonna say, like, what has been going through my mind as you were talking to is, like, I'm curious how staff might come to different percentages. Cause that's the way I think. Versus council versus planning commission. Right. Like, we all bring our own, like, different priorities. And I don't know, like, if maybe collectively we all end up in the same place. But I. I'm sitting on that because. I don't know, I'm mentioning it because I keep on thinking about it multiple times. Ultimately, at the end of the day, to the point that we. We do sign this, like that we. We agree that this is the right order, the right way to go about this. So I am so excited of redoing all of the categories and not using the same prioritization of that were decades old, in part because our. How we think about good asset management, I think, has changed over time and the values that we have as a community. And so I think that that's fantastic. I don't. In terms of the questions specifically that you had to us, other than making sure that, you know, that we might not have specific suggestion about a category for, like, supporting the comprehensive plan right now, maybe two years from now, we do so, like, please, like, I. Like maybe on the, like, the 2026, like, if we can have this conversation again and what that should look like, but in terms of the questions about the metrics for sustainability or affordability or equity, I don't have anything super specific other than to say I'm really glad that we're looking at those. I think where you have, like, the. Particularly, I think a lot about sustainability. And so that we have a comprehensive document that covers all different kind of things, like referencing, that makes a whole lot of sense to me. And I just, again, hope that in each of these groups, like, those are. Those are identified priorities that we have as have come up as priorities across city policy. And so I hope that those percentages are not token, but we'll see. Absolutely. Thank you for your work. Thank you. Thank you. And actually, I will. What you know as the power to, or at least the responsibility to approve the CIP is with the planning commission, just as a hypothetical question, what happens if we don't, we kick it back and say we don't believe this aligns with the comp plan. Like, what happens just procedurally? You guys go back. I think that we would go back. I think we would get feedback from the commission on if there are specific projects that are presenting areas of concern, or we would need to get some feedback about on what basis does this feel out of alignment with our comprehensive planning documents and make revisions and bring it back forward to the planning commission? That's my sense of the process. I haven't seen that happen. I've only been in this role for a couple years, but I hadn't heard of it even during the time that Deb was in the role or prior to Deb. So if mix, Kelly, if you have any other input on that approval process, please feel free. Feel free. Weigh in. I'm just thinking maybe it's our job to drive accountability, right. In that particular respect so that we really dig in and say, hey, you know, I think there's portions of it that don't resonate, and obviously it needs to be an informed kind of discussion with respect to that. But I'm thinking to myself, you know, earlier I said it was a rubber stamp. And I'm like, hey, maybe not, but I think it's really vested in every single person on the screen, I think, to help ensure that there's alignment. Can anyone on the commission think of a project from past CIP, last three years, four years, that felt out of alignment with the comprehensive plan, the adopted master plan? Sure. Since I'm the one, I guess, phrase that question, I suppose it's on me to come up. I don't know that I have an exact particular project, but one of the things I would mention is, for example, some of the site plans that we have approved, we often talked about making sure that the roadways kind of aligned with it. I think state and Packard was one of the intersections we identified as being really awful, awful for pedestrians in a very confusing intersection and, or the passing of TC one, for example, and kind of the coordination of transit corridor improvements that are going to, you know, occur. Obviously, we haven't seen a project come to realization, but those are the kinds of things. Again, Mick Kelly, my point is not to be, you know, controversial or to, I'm just playing a thought game here. So I don't have anything in particular examples. So. But just wanted to say it's, it does appear that there is a sense, you know, amongst the commission that, hey, you know, really, where can we have more active participation with respect to the CIP? Oftentimes people do feel like it's a process that's kind of with some gate papers. And so my one question, and overall, what I do want to say is thank you for a great ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Local Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "I really do try to facilitate that in a way where we are reaching some level of agreement or talking through it if we're not getting agreement, to find the right spot for that project.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "our ...  values that we have as a community ... about sustainability or affordability or equity", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "a lot about sustainability.

Oftentimes people do feel like it's a process that's kind of with some gate papers. And so my one question, and overall, what I do want to say is thank you for a great presentation. Always great to see you. We do miss you on transportation commission. So the categories, to me, seem salient and well done. Again, I think when you look at, for example, things like coordination with other projects and agencies, regionalism, funding, access, mobility, so accessibility actually being already a metric, I think there's a lot of great ways that this has already been parsed out and well thought through. The sole question that I kind of come to is what can the public do to become more involved and create, again, more inclusivity and voice in that CIP process and be more effective? I suppose. So how can the public get more involved? And, Commissioner Weatherby, if you wanted to add something to that, I'm happy to yield the floor to you as well. Yeah, I think it's kind of just adding to that is also what should we do if we notice something like, what's the process for us to do? We just send you an email? Do we bring it to, like, what is the process that we should do? It's just sort of an addition to what the public should do. Sure. So in terms of the public, I would say public and commissioners being very involved in the engagement process for the comprehensive plan is really what is critical. The CIP is meant to be in alignment with that and meant to achieve our asset management planning process on a technical side. But I think that being involved in the comprehensive plans, the CIP is meant to reflect those goals. So, like, when we developed the Vision zero plan and there was broad community engagement and that, that now the CIP, we have specific projects in there based on what was put into the Vision zero plan, and we have scope descriptions written that reflects what that plan says. And so I think, in my opinion, it's really being involved in those comprehensive plans is what leads to CIP projects, and that's the best place for community involvement. I think if there are specific questions or concerns or feedback about the process, always reach out. My contact information is on the website, a twogov.org cip. I would welcome to hear from any commissioners, I'd welcome any input from the public on CIP process or specific projects we do from time to time get questions on. Usually people are curious. I live near a sidewalk gap. When is that going to be filled? Or when will my street be resurfaced? We do get those. We respond to them with the information we have. We have to always also be very cognizant of the fact that we have limited resources and a lot of needs. So that's what is seen, I think, most often in those replies, and that can be frustrating to hear for people that may live on a street with poor pavement condition, as most residents in Ann Arbor probably do. Sorry, I shouldn't say that it's not truly poor by the asset condition interpretation, but there's a lot. My point is just that there's a lot of needs and there's only limits resources. So we have to temper that expectation. But feedback and questions are all welcome. If there's any other Mick Kelly, if you have guidance on how planning commissioners, if you prefer to streamline communications any other way, if you'd like them through you, that's fine with me too. But it doesn't bother me to get direct emails. I mean, it doesn't have to be either or. That's the great thing about email. But there were a few things that were brought up during the meeting that I'm thinking about. One is that how do members of the public and how would the commission have access to the backlog of projects that were scored but not high enough to be included in a six year time horizon or a time horizon that would be visible in the CIP? Some of what we work through with staff are just presenting information, limitations of tools that we have Kayla migrated to a new platform and scoring methodology that's been ramping up over time called allevance. We have some really smart people who are helping us with developing and diving into adjusting our scoring criteria so that they encompass all of the things were brought up today. What's the name of the group that's at the university that is working with our consultant, Kayla think about economic development is where, but they're basically consultants that helped public sector. The Economic Growth Institute is with the university of Michigan Economic Growth Institute. We have a couple of representatives from that group that work with allevance and that's who we're contracting with to help us through these scoring update process. So, you know, some of the things just to, you know, the purpose of this meeting was exactly what Commissioner Mills said was to give more insight into behind the curtain, what can't and for you to tell us, I still can't see this. It's still not visible to me. So I think that probably the transportation Commission has received detailed presentations on the sidewalk gap program the funding, the prioritization that is within that, that maybe this commission hasn't been privy to.

It's still not visible to me. So I think that probably the transportation Commission has received detailed presentations on the sidewalk gap program the funding, the prioritization that is within that, that maybe this commission hasn't been privy to. We could look at finding where those materials are and forwarding them so that it's apparent where, where they exist. I know that a presentation of this kind has to exist, but for some reason it has not been connected back into this group. A lot of projects from you are a lot of questions from you all about sidewalks. So that's clearly something that you're interested in that you want to know. You want to know how often is it updated? How are they scored? Oh, summer in parks. Like, just tell them I want to know. So I hear that definitely. And we can try to dig up where those materials are. And then also I can just brainstorm with Kayla, like how do we share with the public the projects that didn't score high enough to be included? We have a public facing map. If you go to a two gov.org cip. I reference it all the time, but that only shows you the projects that have been scored. It does tell you the project score score. If you're curious, there is information about the project scoring generally on the website, but it needs to be. Maybe people just want even more transparency. So how can we build that systematically into a tool that's within the capacity of staff to deliver? Those are great challenges for us in terms of some of the content about who is thinking about growth. We are talking about growth explicitly and how to accommodate it within the CIP process through the sustainability and equity scoring criteria discussions. That's one of the ways that we want to look at how we measure opportunity. And it's challenging. It's challenging to develop these things in a way that is applicable across all asset groups. There's a lot of different types of projects. Some projects are just maintenance projects and we have to really drill down to figure out which categories did we exclude because they're not applicable? And which categories are we most trying to target an influence? Do those have dollar value thresholds associated with them beyond what it already takes to get into the CIP, which I understand is $100,000? So there's a lot that we are considering. We are considering the alignment with our existing Canada plans. One of the things with the current comp plan update is that it's meant to better align and explicitly incorporate content from the Parks and Recreation open space plan pros plan, the Tree line, Allen Creek Urban Trail Master plan and the moving together towards Vision zero plan while phasing out five other plans. So we don't have that yet, though we will not have that for this fall, which means that we have to do our best. As you all are doing your best at the planning table and as council is doing their best to accommodate growth and recommend what we think is in policy alignment with the city with a lot of other constraints, it would be really, really convenient if we had a plan to end all plans. I've never worked in a community where this was the case. And I don't think, even with the new comprehensive plan in Ann Arbor, that we will have a single source of truth that's part of the art and less of the science of this, of this process, is that it. Development plans, as some have noted, are not always in sync with our five year planning efforts. We don't even know sometimes the week before we get something in stream that we're going to be asked to consider a new development. There are a lot of competing timelines, which makes it interesting and it also makes it really hard. But we are doing our best. And all of the. I can say that all the things that were raised are things that staff are thinking about and not thinking about on a cursory level, but thinking about in hours and hours and hours of meetings in a really, really thoughtful way, trying to do our best. There's not currently a long range division within our planning department. There used to be, as you know, we're growing staff. We have two new planners who are going to be added next week. Maybe that has the potential to grow in the future. But right now, it's. It's definitely been a little bit of a Twister game to try to take on all of the ordinance amendments and other special projects. And I think that this would fall, you know, somewhat in a similar category for. And I am attending a lot of the CIP meetings, Kayla. I don't know how many, but I've seen, I think every day I get a new calendar invite. I'm like, oh, that asset group. That's interesting. So in terms of, is there a planning voice represented at the table? Are we looking at alignment from a holistic lens, from that discipline and from the discipline that's important to the planning commission? I think we are doing our absolute best. And from what I've seen, I see a really thoughtful process that will get even better once we have a new comprehensive plan. Yeah, no, thank you for that. I know you guys are absolutely. I mean, we're very, very grateful to have such a great staff of professionals.

And then, Commissioner Weatherby, final comment before we go? I just. This conversation triggered a memory for me, and I realized that there is a really awesome sidewalk gap page map online that if you just search, like, city of Ann Arbor sidewalk gaps map, there's a really awesome thing of where the sidewalk gaps are and when they were fixed and when they're now, I don't know if that still looks like the last data was 2023, but nonetheless, still awesome, still out there. And it just reminded me that that does exist. Yeah. Yeah. 100%. Thank you. Thank you again, Kayla. Miss Coleman, thank you so much for coming and speaking with us and giving us all kind of an insight into the hood of how, you know, under the hood of how everything's going happening. So any other thoughts that you had on your end, final words from you? Thanks for having me. It's always a pleasure. I love the discussion. There's lots that I learn from each of you every time that I join one of these meetings. There's lots that I learn on things I want to follow up on and get more information from other staff and continue to grow my knowledge in this area as well. So it's really a pleasure. I think that the work we're doing now is going to improve that scoring process, but there will always be more work left to do. We'll have, as Mick Kelly was saying, that the comprehensive plan, it won't be ready for this fall. So maybe we revisit again in a couple of years and we can keep growing this process and making it better. So thank you for your time. Thank you. All right. With that, we're moving on to communications, of which there are none, and then we open up for a final public comment. Do we have anybody here that would like to, for attendees here? Would anyone like to speak at public comment? Few more seconds. With that, I'll close public comments. And we are headed to the final item of the agenda, which is adjournment.
