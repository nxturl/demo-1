No, old business. New business would be a flood mitigation presentation, which I'm assuming is that heritage park. Yeah. He goes, yeah. So I'm gonna. Brad has kindly agreed to join us. So I'm gonna give the attention to Brad, and he is gonna go ahead and give a presentation and ask if anyone has any questions. So really, just for some of our newer members, something that I try to do is bring in our staff who are working on different projects that we have going on, because they are the subject matter experts. So take it away, Brad. Thank you, ma'am. My name is Brad Guy. I work up at public works. My title is the collection system project manager for the city of Davenport. I deal mainly on the sanitary sewer side. But for this one, since it's kind of a big project and it deals with a lot of new infrastructure, they, uh, they assigned this one to me. Um, kind of was going to go through kind of just a quick overview of what's going on down the river. Heritage park right now. I don't know if any of you have driven by it recently. It looks like a war zone. Um, so it'll look nice when we're done. I promise. We'll. We'll fix it up. Um, that picture you're seeing up on the page right now, that was a couple weeks ago. Just kind of the. The scale of what's going on there. And that's only half of it. That's only the western half of the project. There's an entire eastern half of the project that's just as big as that all taking place in the park. So this is kind of a. This sheet is kind of an overview. And I can zoom in a little bit if anybody needs me to. You kind of see where my cursor is going. So this is Cary Avenue here on the right side of the sheet, and then Federal street and then fourth street right here. Basically, the purpose of this project is to protect East river drive when we get floods at a higher level than they are currently protected. What normally happens in a flood is it's not that the water comes up over the river wall there. It comes up through the storm system. There was no. There was never any flood protection installed back when the seawall. The river wall was first built in the 1930s with the storm sewer, the government storm sewer interceptors that are along the riverfront. So basically, once the river comes up to a certain level, it would start coming out of all the intakes and the manholes there in that area. So how does that actually protect it? Well, that's. We're going to get to that point. So when you say a certain level, is this the 19ft? I believe this protects up between 20 and 22. I don't know. Yeah, but it starts coming in around 19. No, I believe it's 18. Yeah, it's between 18 and 20. It comes back up and it's. The biggest problem we have is, as you all know, when it floods, we have to close River Drive. The whole reason for this project is to keep river drive open longer. That's the whole point, because right now, this basically right here between federal and Fourth street, kind of where the cursor is circling, it's a low spot in the road, so the water would come up there first and you couldn't. It wasn't safe to pass through. So what the plan, what the point of this project is, is to keep this part of river Drive dry longer so that we can continue to allow traffic to flow up Fourth street and have a permanent detour on Fourth street. So this is kind of a convoluted picture, but if you look here, if you're familiar with River Heritage park, the gazebo is kind of in this area right here where I'm circling. And this is where the first floodgate is going to be installed. And to answer your previous question, that's how it gets protected. So we're actually installing floodgates into the storm sewer system, as well as realigning the storm sewer system so that everything channels to this floodgate and then another floodgate that we're building on the east side. Underground? Yes, yes, it's mostly underground. It will. This, this one will stick out of ground, out of the ground a little bit because of the elevation we have to reach. But the good thing is, is that it will be decorative. So if you look here, these pictures on the right hand side, this is what, at the end of the day, this is what it should look like. And there's a. There's a couple of better pictures. So if you're standing back on the east side of the park, looking west, you can kind of. Right here is where the floodgate would be. And as you can tell, it kind of blends in with the. What the park should look like this is a little bit closer view. Once they get it built, they'll put these decorative stones and there'll be some landscaping installed, things like that. That's if you're.

That parking lot, that existing parking lot that's there. If you come off of the parking lot onto the path, this is what it'll look like. Because it is so, so close to the bike path. And in a park, we wanted, you know, we didn't want just some big concrete structure sticking out of this, out of the ground. And that's kind of what it looks like without the plantings. And you kind of see back here where the cursor is in the background, there's a little bit of pavement. What we're doing is we're actually adding kind of a driveway to it so that it can be in times of flood, we'll have to put a pump there so it's a place to access it and have the equipment be able to place a pump there at the floodgate. So, Brad, time to detail. So will this be manual closure? Yes. No, with a. With a. Well, with a manual closure. As in it's not automated. It's not. You know, it doesn't automatically. It's not remote controlled. It'll have. It's. It's made to use an electric motor to exercise perfect close together. My only question would be when the cruise ships are there and this is something I brought up before, that's where their delivery trucks like to park. Right in that choke point. I believe that that's being. There's somebody on staff working and there'd really be nowhere for the bikes to go if they blocked that choke point. Who's they? Like the trucks. If the trucks keep doing it. I mean, I don't think they've ever been supposed to do it. But they park like literally in that gap to where there'd be nowhere for the bikes to get through. Like I said, I believe there's a member of staff working on that. I can't speak to that because. Yeah, that's. Brad is correct. Yeah. So that's kind of a rundown of what the west side will look like. You can see this is all new pipe that's being installed. This is the new floodgate that's being installed. And then this is new pipe that's actually running to where my cursor is. Now, if you're not aware, there are 210 by ten vaults that run the entire length of the river wall there. Those were built when the roller dams and the seawall were built in the 1930s. Basically, all of the storm sewer above the roller dams drains into these boxes and then outlets on the downstream side of the roller dam. It's the way the core can keep track of the pool level. They can. They can control the pool level that way so that the storm sewers go. They basically get outleted downstream of the roller dams instead of being outletted there in upstream of the roller dams. So what we're doing is we're creating a new connection into that government box. We had to go through the whole permitting process of talking to the corps of Engineers and going through their design and making sure everything was up to stuff with them. So that's what that is, is we actually have to excavate down, and I've got a couple of pictures of what it looks like, excavate down and create a new connection into that storm box. Now, hasn't there been more underground work done east of this, like over by the yacht club and through that area, or is this the farthest, most east that we've put some flood mitigation in up to now? So the work you're referring to was all sanitary sewer work. There was that big project three, four years ago that basically stretched the entire length of downtown Davenport along the riverfront. That was. That was me as well. That was all sanitary sewer work. And then the work recently down closer to the yacht, the yacht club, basically on the west side of Iowa, american water plant that was also a sanitary sewer job. There was a combined sewer system further up the hill, like in Prospect park, where the storm and sanitary sewers were combined. That was part of a separation project. So this is the farthest, the most eastern part of our flood mitigation up to this point, is that right? Correct. For it's going to keep going westward, obviously, through the downtown area eventually, of various means of flood mitigation. Well, there are existing flood measures through the downtown area, but, yeah, these are this project and then the Marquette street project that I'll discuss as well. Those are the two that were, that have been approved by council. They're part of the flood study that was done a couple of years ago. These are two recommendations from that flood study. And these are all funded, correct? Yeah. This project, this particular project, the one in River Heritage park, was all, it was part of the approved ARPA funding. So the ARPA funding that the city got, this was part of it. The Marquette and River Drive project, which we'll go over after this one, was a it's a basic. It's funded through FEMA, through kind of some. It was basically a congressional earmark that was funded through an existing FEMA priority. And it's a bunch of backdoor ways of getting funding for it. It turned out where the city had to cover a certain percentage, and then we got the rest through federal and state funding", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Marquette and River Drive Project\",\n        \"positives\": [],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n        \"comment\": \"The transcript provides no detailed information about the positive or negative impacts of the project necessary for investment decisions.

And it's a bunch of backdoor ways of getting funding for it. It turned out where the city had to cover a certain percentage, and then we got the rest through federal and state funding. And here you can kind of see, like I said, that driveway to get up and to access it, so that it will be manned during actual flood times. And then. So this is the easternmost part of this is kind of an overview of what's going on in the easternmost part of the park. This right like where my cursor is here, that's where Hahn is. The concrete plant there. And then this is the parking lot there, just west of Han River Drive, and Fourth street here, obviously. So what you see here in purple, and you see this line right here, that says 240 inches, that represents, you know, the approximate location of that big government storm box that I was talking to. So all of these squiggly lines you see here, they're all existing storm sewers that are being abandoned. We're disconnecting all of that, and then we're rerunning new storm sewer. That's everything you see here in the light blue color. And then it actually progresses further east upriver drive kind of to Kerry Avenue. And basically the whole point of that is to capture all of the intakes coming off of river Drive from back here to Fourth street. And everything coming from the east from Cary street is to capture it and relay new sewer so that it will then all go to this point right here. And that's where the second flood gate structure is going to be, is it right in that location? And that will also stick out of the ground a little bit. It's got. And here's another just plan sheet. Kind of shows you all the pipework that's. That's going on. This is what the structure will look like if you were to, you know, cut it in half and look at it underground. It's got two gates in it, so they're redundant. It's got a gate on each side of the structure. The structure has two sides in it. Because the point is, you close the gate, you set your intake hose on one side of the gate, you throw your discharge hose on the other side, and then you can pump from and back into the same structure. That way you don't have hose laying across the park and having to dump it out into the river and things like that. So because it will be sticking out, you can kind of see right here, it's kind of notated to have a. You know, there's a couple of feet that'll stick up out just a few feet that'll stick up out of the ground. It's going to be decorative. So there's actually going to be a form liner that. That gets put into that concrete work that sticks up on the ground. So this will be. It'll look like this. And then the plan is, you know, maybe have some smaller flowers and plants and things like that around it to keep it, you know, keep it looking decorative, because it will be right in the middle of the park. And as you can see from this picture, it's. I mean, it's right where the paths of the park and the bike path, you know, all come together there. So that is. That's the river Heritage park flood project. And then this one, you haven't. You've probably seen some work going on there. Can I just ask one quick question? Yes. Back there, it's raining. We're gonna get two inch rain, three inch rain. The gates are down. There's pumps that are pumping. How many are there? How are you getting the water off the streets? Pumps. That's no different than. No different than when any floodgate is closed, a pump will be put in place there at the same location. And that's where you said you had an exit. Is that. Did I hear that right or correct? So this. This structure right here. So if you have where the floodgate is being built. Yes. It's a two sided structure that you can pump. I thought that's what I heard you say. So one pump to where do you pump it? To? Pump it into the river. It's basically the hydraulics of the river. Keep it, even though you'd basically be like a magic cup, even though you keep dumping water into it, it's going to stay at the same level because it's the hydraulics of the river. So, again, this will be the Marquette project, which I'm sure you may have seen river driving Marquette. You may have seen some work going on there recently. That was before work that the water company was doing. They had to relocate sections of their water main in preparation for the storm sewer work that was going to be happening here and here. I can zoom this one in a little bit. So you can kind of see. So we got West River Drive and Marquette street. There currently is flood protection at this location. I'm sure you've all seen during a flood, they put the fence up around there, or. And there's a whole bunch of pumps that you. It kind of looks like an octopus. There's hoses going everywhere right here in this gravel lot just to the west of the basketball courts there. The point of this project is to improve that existing system. The existing system is old. It's, you know, the gate is. The gate is old. It was installed years and years and decades ago. What this does is it helps protect to a little bit better level without having to have people man it all the time.

That was before work that the water company was doing. They had to relocate sections of their water main in preparation for the storm sewer work that was going to be happening here and here. I can zoom this one in a little bit. So you can kind of see. So we got West River Drive and Marquette street. There currently is flood protection at this location. I'm sure you've all seen during a flood, they put the fence up around there, or. And there's a whole bunch of pumps that you. It kind of looks like an octopus. There's hoses going everywhere right here in this gravel lot just to the west of the basketball courts there. The point of this project is to improve that existing system. The existing system is old. It's, you know, the gate is. The gate is old. It was installed years and years and decades ago. What this does is it helps protect to a little bit better level without having to have people man it all the time. Right now, as soon as the river gets up to like 14 and a half, I believe. I don't remember the exact, but right in there, you currently have to start pumping to keep the intersection dry. The point of this project is to, again, to kind of reconfigure the storm sewer in the area so that you won't have to be physically pumping to keep the intersection dry at that low of a level. You'll still have to have pumps there. To your point d, that, you know, anytime it rains, if the gate's closed, obviously you have to have a pump there to collect the stormwater, but it won't be continuous pumping to keep the intersection dry. So I'm just curious. This intersection has coal tar in it. Yes. Right? Yes. So did the water company deal with that? Yes. That's not fun, correct? Yeah. That's why if you ever went by there and saw that it was sitting for a while, that's because their game plan needed to be taken, put in place. And same with, before we begin construction on this project, we've already drilled a couple test pits and tested the water, and we've already got a plan in place in any of the areas we need to make water and climate. The biggest problem is here on the north side of the intersection. Yeah. The good thing is there's a very, very small part of the project in that area down here. We've done lots of work in the past kind of in this area. And even when I was down there a few years ago, same thing, we did some test pits. It didn't come across anything. That's because your predecessors all took it out for you. Not knowing I was going, they could have done the north side, too. I don't think we knew it was coal tar till the mid nineties. So that's kind of an overview of the project. And then. Cool. That's cool. Same kind of. Just an outline of kind of what's going on in bay. Basically, the point of it is to. And the structure is going to look the exact same as the other one in the other park. It's a double sided structure that you can pump from and pump to at the same place. It will stick out of the ground a little bit. We've kind of pushed the whole thing to the. If you can see here, we've kind of. Currently, it's right about here where the cursor is. We've pushed the whole thing further to the south to try to intercept some more of the storm sewers that were kind of in the past were on the backside of the existing floodgate, which is why he constantly had to pump, and the water would come out of different areas. So the good thing about this project is it'll also capture the storm sewers that are currently coming from Myrtle street. Because Myrtle street is one that goes under. Yeah, it goes first before Marquette does. So this will help protect Myrtle street from. For a longer time as well. Is there a projected level that it'll keep this intersection operable, I believe, till 18? I believe that's because at that point, it's the same level as the old pumping system. It's just a new one. Yes. Well, it's a functional one. The previous one was less than functional. I would imagine. Once you get to a certain level, it's no longer. It's no longer this storm sewer that is the problem. It's other storm sewers that the river has hit a certain point that there's so much water coming out of the intakes and, you know, either up at the second of Marquette. Think about it. It's going over the. It's already going over water wise, over land, right at the river, and at 18, the whole thing is enveloped. Correct. Yeah, because at that point, we've got water all over the street, know, south of here, and it's running. It's our. It's surface water coming, correct. Yeah, it's. It's the actual river. It's the river. It's on second street at that point. It's everywhere. Yeah, it's. It's. It's no longer just coming up because of the elevation of the storm system. It's. It's the actual river at that point. So, like I said, we've got a couple pictures of the. The east project, the river Heritage park project, because, again, Marquette hasn't started yet. They're. They're starting here pretty quick. So this is. Yeah, this is the further east section. So kind of in the background here, behind this big pile of dirt and debris would be the Han plant. And you can kind of see where this ladder is. You can sort of see right in here. You kind of see it looks like a concrete, just a face of a piece of concrete that is the outside wall of that government storm sewer. So that's that. That's basically where. That's where the storm sewer is. And, you know, just setting some pipe and some of the structures on the new storm sewer. And you can see here, this is. That's that government box that was built in the 1930s. What we're doing to connect to it, like I said, we got permitted through the corps of engineers and everybody else. We basically have to build it like a bomb structure. We have to put steel rebar in, connect it to the drilling new pins into the storm box so that everything we connect to it, it's basically a solid structure, and it can't shift any different or anything like that, yo", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"The Water Company\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Relocating sections of the water main in preparation for storm sewer work\",\n            \"Improving the existing flood protection system\",\n            \"Reducing the need for continuous pumping during floods\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [\n            \"Handling sections containing coal tar\"\n        ],\n        \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n        \"comment\": \"While the company is engaged in infrastructure improvements and flood protection, handling coal tar is a challenge.

We're digging so low on the ground, we're fighting groundwater constantly. This is one of the old existing pipes that went into the government storm sewer. And you see, that's how they keep the water from coming back out is they've got an inflatable plug in there, and that's what it's specifically designed for, is for plug in sewers. And then they're. They're obviously mitigating the water in their trench so that they can start building the structure. And the pipe that goes to it, kind of just the forms of the structure that they're building. And this right here in the foreground, that is the top of that government storm sewer. So they've got it excavated down to that. And that's what this guy. That's what the ladder is sitting on. And then you can see here that ball sitting there. And this is the, you know, the steel reinforcement of the structure. Basically, we're extending out the government sewer a little bit, building a structure to connect the pipe to. Are these city employees or. No, this is contract. This is contract work. Yeah. Yes. So that's kind of. Once it's built. Once it's built, that's what it looks like. This will be connected to the government sewer, and then the pipe will go from here and then continue through for the rest of the system. And then. Yeah, just to get an idea of how much steel is in that, it's like I said, it's built like a bomb structure. It has to support a lot of weight on top of it. It has to support a lot of internal pressure from when the river comes up. And that water on the inside is pushing against the inside. So it's a well engineered, basically, thing in the ground that you'll never see. This is kind of a cool picture. This is part of the existing sewer and this was. This is actually existing sewer that was there prior to the 1930s construction. So this is one of the, like the original late 18 hundreds, early 19 hundreds sewers for the city of Davenport. What's that? Bricklayed? It's a limestone. It's handmade limestone with a flat bottom with an arch. Yeah, this was all handmade and you can see the flat bottom to it. And what we're doing is we're digging it back and we'll dig it back and remove all this and lay all new sewer in there. And again, kind of a. An idea of how much steel is going into these structures and how. How strong they need to be to. To withstand all the environmental forces that they'll be dealing with. And then that's what it. I mean, it looks like a building underground, but it'll all be buried and you'll never see it. So that's pretty much an overview. I got a couple of quick facts. Yeah. Like the river heritage park. Like I said, the main purpose is to upgrade the existing storm sewer that's in the area, the installation of two new floodgates, and to reroute everything. So it's going into one of those two areas where it's protected by the floodgate. It'll keep traffic open somewhere between river stage 21 and 22. I don't know exactly off the top of my head what that number is currently. That area is affected at like 17, 18ft. And we had to previously start putting detours in where we were detouring people up Tremont. The point of this is to not have to have that detour anymore and keep traffic flowing to fourth street. This was part of the approved ARPA budget that city approved a few years ago. And the. The construction cost for this is $3.8 million for this project. That was the bid. That's a pretty significant improvement, though, from 17 to 21 to 22ft. It's a massive improvement. Yeah, massive improvement. I think it was ranked one in projects. Right? I believe this was one. I don't know what the ranking is, but, yeah, I know most of the flood mitigation projects were pretty high when they did all the ranking for the ARPA projects. And then the river drive and marquette project. Same as the East river drive, except for it's improving existing infrastructure and existing floodgates that are there, removing and replacing the old gate that, like I said, it closes, but it's old, it leaks. There's infrastructure that, you know, there's pipes that are. That come in behind the existing floodgate so that, you know, it's not protected all the way up. It'll require less staff intervention at the lower flood levels so they won't have to be pumping at 14ft just to keep the intersection open. And then the funding for this one was it's a congressional, federal, congressional earmark through an existing FEMA program and it's administrated through the Iowa homeland Security. So the split is 15% city cost and then the remaining 85% is federal and state funding. And this one is 1.44 million is the construction budget on this one. That's what the bid came in is 1.44 million. So if you have any questions, I would be more than happy to answer them. Pretty exciting stuff, Brad. And actually, you know, this is like something like in a YouTube video on the city website. I think people geek would really enjoy seeing this.

And actually, you know, this is like something like in a YouTube video on the city website. I think people geek would really enjoy seeing this. And I've got a lot of questions about the big hole and only because they're so curious what it all does. It's just so much bigger than anyone ever understand and it's amazing what it's doing. I'm sure that there's some basic things on website or public works emails. Is there a communication plan to the community around these major things that are slow moving, very important, but invisible? Somewhat invisible. So I can't speak to the communication plan, but I know we give people updates on a fairly regular basis or they'll ask us for updates. And I believe the city is posting it on Facebook as well as some of their other media outlets. So I can speak to that a little bit. So we do post on Facebook occasionally snippets. Robin Dunn will go ahead and post those to the best of her ability to communicate with the general public. Right. On some of these items, there are more in depth descriptions. If you go to the city administrator update, it's a monthly update that's on our website and you can actually find each ARPA project specifically and where it's at in its progress. So that might be another area that if we were interested and wanted to tell the public about. That's a more in depth description of where we're at in its current time. Does it do. That's what I was saying. Pictures like this. So not as many, but I would. I would bet that like on next month. I mean, I just. This is amazing. I mean, like I had my whole career here knowing something was seriously wrong. But to have the answer and what we're going to see here, it's people who lived during the last 50 years are going to be astounded. Plus, I think it's just. I'm just. It's cool. Oh, yeah. I love a picture like that. I absolutely love what you're doing. You know, you're going to be honest with. The public really doesn't understand pumping systems. And if we ever go forward in more of these projects. Correct. They really need to understand what manning a pump and what, what pumping is versus seeing just a machine on the top with the hose going down a manhole. Cause that's kind of like temporary. And the permanent stuff, this would be an introduction to kind of the whole. What? Permanent pumping stations, permanent gates. What these look like. And by the way, just so I just wanna. The other thing is to understand that these people have to exercise this and work this all year long. And so you can't underfund your staff. Correct. You have to have expert staff to come that know all year long what's going on. I know. It's a good thing. Yeah. I know when they do the, like the Davenport u stuff, the Davenport University stuff. I know when they go through public works, when they have the public works day, I'm usually one of the people that does the tours. And I try to make all of the. Because I. I started in the sewer division, was with the city of Davenport. That's when I first got hired with the city. I was a laborer in the sewer division. So all this flood mitigation and protection stuff is near and dear to my heart because I've been out there at 03:00 in the morning when it's raining, working these gates and doing all this kind of stuff. So, Andrea, did you have anything? No, I was just going to say, you know, all this detail I'm sure could be disseminated fairly easily. Are the slides visible on the YouTube video of this meeting or is it just us? Yes. Nope. I'll have to double check on that. I mean, honestly, the presentation we just got, which is awesome, clipped out of that would be pretty. The idea of putting Brad on a YouTube channel to go ahead and showcase this. No, I mean, really, that is the kind of thing we ought to do. It's sort of the how it's made concept, right? Where you have ongoing YouTube videos and things like that. I love it. You know, if you want your citizens to actually be informed, you have to communicate in a way that people take and communicate information now, which is doing YouTube videos and having. I mean, you could easily create a really fun, sort of ongoing, how it's made, how it works kind of thing, where you're really communicating and then it. And it's archived. So it's not a one time thing. Right. People can go back over and over and look at it. I feel like this is how you build trust, you build awareness. Exactly. You build understanding. You get kind of a wild feeling from the public. My only comment to that would be, it's a double edged. So I'm all for it after the fact. I'm not a big fan of not bringing attention, but what we don't want is somebody to take pictures and, I mean, it is. Yeah, it's the reason we have the bike path closed through there is because it is not safe to be. There is so much equipment moving around down there. It is not safe for somebody who does, doesn't understand a construction site to be anywhere near that area. But knowing that this type of thing and that picture to me, really tells a lot.

And it's archived. So it's not a one time thing. Right. People can go back over and over and look at it. I feel like this is how you build trust, you build awareness. Exactly. You build understanding. You get kind of a wild feeling from the public. My only comment to that would be, it's a double edged. So I'm all for it after the fact. I'm not a big fan of not bringing attention, but what we don't want is somebody to take pictures and, I mean, it is. Yeah, it's the reason we have the bike path closed through there is because it is not safe to be. There is so much equipment moving around down there. It is not safe for somebody who does, doesn't understand a construction site to be anywhere near that area. But knowing that this type of thing and that picture to me, really tells a lot. It might slow down some of the build a wall. You know, some of those people might slow them down a little bit if they understand this is going on. And it's a very high detailed, very sophisticated system and it's being installed and, you know, because we always have those people. Oh, I don't devour, build a wall. You know, we always have those. I don't think our intent here is to make a decision or judgment or recommendation on whether something like that should or shouldn't happen or that to diminish the discourse of that. But what I would say is that educating the community, I'm not just, here's a storm sewer and look at all this awesome stuff. It's. What function does this serve? How is it impacting water mitigation? You know, how is this. How does this work in very layman's terms, and then provide them opportunities to dig into it further and has to be very digestible. What was it before and what is it going to do now? So it went from 17ft flooding to now, 21 to 22. That's very understandable and a major improvement. Yeah, definitely, definitely. I would keep Brad here for the rest of the meeting, but we do have quite a bit of business. I just have one last question. Are there plans? And I don't know if it's in the master plan for further stormwater work towards, like, the east village, because that's also a flood prone area as well. On River Drive Mound street. Yes, yes, I believe within the flood mitigation plan, the study that was done a few years ago, there is something for the east village. Thanks. Thank you. Now that there's nothing currently in design or in the current CIP budget, but it is part of the overarching study that we've done. No problem. Thank you very much. Thank you, Brad. If you do have additional questions, you're more than welcome to shoot me an email and I'd be happy to get those to Brad and get the answers back to the. That's no problem. We do have Mary on the phone. Mary, can you hear us? Okay. That's okay. No problem. I was. So we have. It's my understanding that Andrea was able to join the last meeting, but she is officially a voting member now according to the council. And then we also have Dan with us. So I just wanted to take a quick minute, if it's okay with all Gwendolyn to just go around super fast and just introduce ourselves and then just state how long you've been with the riverfront Improvement commission. Thank you. Or your best estimate. So, Mary, do you mind starting first? Sure. My name is Mary Press. I'm a representative from the 6th ward living in Davenport. And I've been on the commission for probably about six months or so. Thank you, Mary. I'm Scott Pettis, second ward. Been on, just going on one year now. I'm Chris Meyer. I'm the liaison from the Parks advisory board to this commission. So I kind of report back and forth in both directions on what parks is doing and what RAC is doing. And I've been doing that, I think, about two years. I'm Bill Churchill. I represent the 7th ward. And I've been on this commission about six or seven years, I think somewhere around there. I'm Dee Bremmer. I represent the 8th ward. I live in the 7th ward, so I don't know what that means. And I've been on the commission about six years. I'm Gwen Lindley. I have been on maybe about four or five years. And I'm one of the alder. Originally I was JJ Condon's appointee. And now all the woman Newton has agreed not to kick me off. So she says I can stay under her purview. So continuing on with her, I'm Julie Tun. It's been about a little over three years. And mayoral representative Andrea Olsen. And this is meeting number three, Kelly Grubbs. I actually started, I think, the same time Dee did, although I did serve on the riverfront improvement commission, the levee improvement commission for, I don't know, about twelve years, I think, back in the nineties. So this is kind of my second go round with the river. And I'm Dan Darlin so I've been on the river Improvement commission for, I think, officially about two weeks since the city council meeting last. Then I'm also the chairman of the zoning board of adjustment for the City of Davenport, so. All right. And then I have celebrated my official first year as the staff liaison to the riverfront improvement mission. It has been, honestly, a lot of fun, a lot of learning, and I am just super thankful for the flood predictions or the lack thereof. So my time last year, it was a bit of a trial by fire and coming into the commission and then coming into a flood right away. And that was my first experience working with our tenants directly on flood mitigation. So it was, like I said, a learning experience, but a great opportunity to build relationships with our tenants right out of the gate. And that's really what I took away from that experience. So, yeah, well, we're excited to have a full commission and wanted to get started here with. We'll have Gwendolyn kind of just take us through a new business.

And so, Gwendolyn, we are at the approval of the Antonella, am I okay, take over. Apologies for being late in that muscle memory. Even though last month I was on time, I just can't shake it. So, no, I appreciate everybody's grace on that. So next up, we have the approval of the Antonio. So we have looked over this one last month. And, Courtney, can you give us kind of a high level of some of the promises between how we're adjusting these leases moving forward? Yes. So typically, the way in which we would approach a lease is at least 60 days before, if not 90 days before I am notified that the lease is up for renegotiation or renewal. And so then at that time, what we do is we go ahead and we look at the lease and we will throw it out to the commission to see if there is anything specific that the commission wants us to consider in the renegotiation process. There are a few other parties that we also throw this back out to. So, for example, our legal department will review this document as well as our CFO. While our CFO has reviewed this document, she has also graciously allowed me to work with our assistant finance director. His name is Jim Odeen. He manages all of our revenue services. And I would say in working with him on these two specific ones in the last month, he has just really been able to go through these documents and take out any unnecessary language as well as update necessary language, and then provide terms of the agreement that would be really helpful for the tenants. So just one new thing that you will see that is different from last month that I did want to make note of is actually the rent schedule. I think that's a good idea. It's a great idea. And I really think having Jim help us through this part with our tenants, there's so many pieces to the tenant relationship, and one of them is obviously making sure that we collect our rent in a timely manner. So that was, like I said, between just minor language updates as well as the rent schedule. That is what Jim has helped us approve. I also just quickly note that in the last year that I have been here, one of the things that we have done, because this question comes up, how much do you charge your tenants, or how much do you know to charge your tenants? And so what we did in the last year is we actually took basically, like, an analysis, and we have per square footage, what each tenant is paying. And then we also looked at, like, how. How fair and comparable that is, and then looked at adjustments of a 5% increase. So that is something that we tried to be pretty consistent on in the last several leases, is looking at a 5% increase. And typically we can go anywhere from one year to two years to three years. So you'll see in this example, this first one on the agenda is the Antonella's lease. And so on the Antonella's lease, you'll notice that they are seeking a three year term with a 5% increase. And that 5% increase is good for year one, two, and three. So it's not like in year two, we're going to add an additional 5%. We're not. It's just. It's the same 5% one, two, and three, if that makes sense. Courtney, you have the first year schedule. Are you gonna mail them the second year? Is that what you plan on doing? Yeah. Right? Yep. So that was. This was just as an example? Yep. A sample to just, like, get them started. And then Jim said that he would work with us to make sure that the communication is there. Now, we also talked about utilities and taxes, but it was a little bit short notice to redo the lease on that. Or we're going to do that by a different billing mechanism. Yep. So we have a different billing mechanism that we've been working with the gym on to go ahead and seek to organize that among some of our other tenants that are not necessarily riverside improvement commission tenants, but I can provide an upgrade date on where we're at with that. Next 1 second one for a second. Do I have any discussion on the lease? All in favor of approving the new lease, say aye. Looks like we're keeping them with their delicious pizza. Three more years. All right. Up next, let's look at the farmers market lease. Sure. So with the farmers market lease, theirs is a little bit different in the sense that we have agreed to one year at the 5% increase. The reason, and there are a few reasons for this, but one of the reasons that I would ask for the commission's consideration on and that some of our past commissioners know about is the farmers market is aware that our building, formerly known as like miracle on State street. So it was the proper. So that particular suite is vacant at this time. And so farmers market would like to produce a business plan and a business case to submit to the commission for consideration of obtaining that as part of a larger lease in the future. Missy actually reached out to me yesterday and said that she hopes to have that business case to us by next month. So as soon as we receive the business case, then I would bring that to the commission for further discussion, at which point, it's a lengthy process. We'll want to see what the business case says.

So as soon as we receive the business case, then I would bring that to the commission for further discussion, at which point, it's a lengthy process. We'll want to see what the business case says. We'll want to ask additional questions. But just so that you all are aware, I do anticipate her submitting a business case, and she had shared that with us a few months ago. So we've been waiting on that business case. But the other piece to this is that neither here nor there, whether the commission approves them to take on that space or doesn't approve them to take on the space, that is really, I guess, the caveat to whether or not they, you know, not necessarily whether or not they want to extend the lease, but that is a caveat to how that would affect their lease. So that would increase, like, the number of square footage that they would have if they were to take that on. And then some other pieces to this is the commission only has the ability to write a three year lease. The farmers market, they consider this their home. They consider Davenport their home. They're very passionate about staying here in Davenport. And it may be that they want to consider, like, a five year lease instead of a three year lease, which we can do as a commission in the sense that we could make that recommendation to council if that's something that they really want to pursue. I believe visit Quad Cities was in a similar situation. I know their lease was more than three years and had to go through city council. So this. This may be something similar a year out from now, but right now, we are only considering a one year lease at a 5% increase. So they're certainly aware that if they take on more space, their lease is going to go up. I mean, that's not complicated. That is correct. They are aware and it may not be at the square footage that they're paying. That is correct. And so that would. Those. Those would definitely be. They're highly subsidized. Dan, in terms of the other business partners that we have at the freight house, I don't know if we're subsidizing. We're not getting the payments. That would help us do normal improvements. Has communication occurred between the other businesses that utilize the Florian Keene parking lot on Wednesdays? It says here that they want to utilize that, and I'm not sure if that's that entire parcel, like, all the way to the far road where that light is. So the Florian keen, or is that just half? It's. So it's all the way up to the river's edge, if that makes sense. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. The western side of it, right? Yeah. Not the riverside parking, but the western parking past the stage is Florian king, technically. So it doesn't affect any other businesses other than baseball park, which they have an agreement. Oh, okay, great. We've moved to approve. All those in favor, say aye. Yes. So I, common Cord, Tyson Danner, and Steve Irons, the director of strategic initiatives, reached out to me again. As we look at this year, they have their one sound piano project in which they actually go and place a piano at the freight house on behalf of a donation that we make. Typically, they ask for a $2,000 donation, but from us, they only ask for $1,000 donation. While I have no opinions for or against, this is something just to let you all know that we had supported last year. It's a really great cause. I've been able to see it in motion. So really, what I'm asking today is if there's further discussion that you want to have on that. Certainly we can have that discussion, but otherwise, they are wanting to know if this is something that we want to proceed with. So that would also be something that I would ask for a motion for today. If that's something that you would want to. That's $1,000. It's a. That's within our budget. It is within your budget. I'll move that we do give one sound. The $1,000. Yeah, I think it activates that space nicely and, you know, kind of adds a little life. Like, it's funny, last time I was there, I didn't see as many of the pianos around downtown, and so just kind of adds a little bit of character and texture. So I'm definitely in favor. Did you second it then? So I guess I would second it. That's a very long second. Any other discussion? That's what I was gonna ask is what exactly. What exactly do they do? Right. They put pianos around downtown to connect. So this is just one for the farmers market. So they'll put a piano down for the season on the porch. It kind of moves back and forth on the stage. So for the. For the season of the farmer's market. Okay. And then oftentimes, if you're down at the farmer's market, common cord actually has a youth group, if you will, that goes down and does live performances. And it's not just for them. Anyone can utilize it, but it's pretty neat to see in motion if you get an opportunity. All right, all those in favor of the $1,000.01 sound grant, say aye. All right, excellent. Let's give them some money. All right, up next, the house, the focus, I guess. Do we want Courtney or Dee kind of take the lead? All right.

Kent Pilcher for Mestos Company volunteered to kind of lead discussion, along with Kyle Carter from the downtown group with our tenants, to kind of talk with them about currently, what their space is working for them, what doesn't work for them, and kind of their vision of the future for or their business as it's located. And our goal there is, while we have a shive hattery study that has done, and we have in the CIP, a number of what I call main structure improvements, like roofs and tuck pointing and all those things. What we haven't viewed and what we haven't discussed with our tenants is what's working for them and not working for them. Bathrooms, upgrades, electrical boxes, just partition space, those kinds of things. So there are, like five tenants. We're talking to all of those on the freight house, and then also taste of Ethiopia for kind of a slightly different reason, but kind of to see where they are and what we should be thinking as a commission, as a landlord, what, besides this million or $2 million that we've requested from the council, which I guess is kind of moving through the process to be approved, what really then makes these businesses be able to make the most money they possibly can in those spaces. And also, as a landlord, give us the best return on our investment. Right. So we're going to have those discussions, we almost had them this Friday, but things are going to fall apart. But so those discussions with taste of Ethiopia, there's a study and we're going to do the mitigation, flood mitigation plan. Right. And it puts walls up, but it makes it very difficult to get into the taste of ethiopian even today. I just, you know, even though you can walk around there, for anyone who's handicapped or has any kind of walking or mobility problem, you have a very difficult time getting to the front door because it's on the other side and you're parked and, you know, the parking should be on the north side. So far, Graham, which was the consultants that did the actual design of the flood wall, actually added a patio deck that came over to the west side and came down, which would be kind of the largest patio food that we would have like for one small business, a wonderful addition. And, you know, we don't know how long we'll have taste of Ethiopia. You know, they've talked about retiring, so what would really make that kind of work for us? But we've never really looked inside of it since we've rented it and what inside may need. So that discussion with them is what works for you as a restaurant inside the small place, what is not working and what kind of improvements should the landlord be making? So this is really to get to a point where we have kind of a program for each space and potential costs that we may and projects that we may need to do in the future. So that's kind of where we are. The other thing I think we can do with the taste is if we can get this done correctly, I think it would be good information for the commission to re request grants. So while the FEMA funded all of the outside in the city's match, this deck is 170,000. And I think there's potential out there to get funding that's not city funding to help us build them. So that's kind of where we are hopefully to meet before the end of our April meeting. Not by March, probably. Yeah, it seems like there's a lot of competing schedules happening. Yeah. I was excited to get Kyle involved with that discussion, and then, of course, sorry, the developer. Yeah. Such a resource. And so they're obviously putting some special time and attention. Yeah, they're using a couple of their staff member who does a lot of estimating to be able to kind of look at the two studies and kind of update some costs. So we have, like, current costs, the shive Hattery study, the last time it was 2018, and the big projects have been updated by city staff. But going back in and looking at these others, it would be helpful for us to go into our next CIP with some, you know, kind of ideas. Material costs have done a lot since 2018. Right. And Dee brings up a really good point that I'm happy to make an offer to both Dan and Andrea. If you ever want to sit together outside of this meeting and review our CIP projects. It really is a process. I actually had Clay come in. He is our director of capital improvement Projects. Had him come in. When was this?

I will tell you, it is a lot of staff time on my behalf and then also on. I'd be honest if I wasn't recognizing him. His name is Eric Sam. He's our senior operations manager for all of our facilities maintenance. He has been, I would say, instrumental this last year and helping us really prioritize what are some of our immediate needs from a maintenance standpoint. So, like I said, happy to meet with you kind of separately on the CIP projects that were submitted by our commission this last year.

He has been, I would say, instrumental this last year and helping us really prioritize what are some of our immediate needs from a maintenance standpoint. So, like I said, happy to meet with you kind of separately on the CIP projects that were submitted by our commission this last year. And then, to Dee's point, kind of some future things that we need to be thinking about. And I 100% believe, like, that these focus groups are. Are what we need to help us get to the next CIP projects. This is actually, they've been talking about this for years, but they really put it in writing and in motion when we had a joint. So typically, once a year, we will have a joint meeting with city council. And at that meeting, I think this last year was really. It was really good for me, but I think it was good for the commission, too. We were able to kind of reaffirm, what are our priorities as a commissioner commission, you know, like, what. What are we here for? What are we here to produce? And so then the commission came together and wrote out those priorities, submitted that to council, and then council had a better understanding, I believe, of, like, okay, yes, this is. This is what we're here to accomplish. So just something to think about. Yeah, I would love to. Okay. Yes, we can schedule a time. He is up next. Let's go to the Florentine electrification project. So this is something that I just. I want to bring to the table. And there may or may not be much discussion tonight on it, but something that I definitely want us to consider. So, years ago, a capital improvement project was submitted to produce the additional electrical within the Florian Keynes parking lot. And I can say from even experience in putting on events such as red, white, and boom, working with the downtown Davenport Partnership, working with the farmers market, that this is a project that is needed if we want to continue to stay on the cusp of providing, just providing entertainment in that area. And so, like I said, this was a project that was submitted years ago as a Cip project. It was taken off the board at that time because the roof became a priority. And at the time, you kind of. You have to take what you have. The roof and gutters became a priority. So we had to, I believe, move the funding source from this project to support the roof and gutter. So in speaking with some of our partners, like the downtown Davenport partnership with Kyle, and in speaking with Missy at the farmer's Market, one of the things that I wanted to challenge Missy at the farmers market with specifically is how can we. How can we write a grant to be able to support this so that we're not necessarily taking from capital improvement funding that we actually need to. To support our current buildings and our maintenance and facility structure. So in meeting with her and like I said, Stephanie and Kyle and just some of our community partners, we would like to seek funding potentially with an SCRA grant. However, with some of those grants, when you think about those grants, they want some type of match or some type of fund upfront. So, given that our. I would say, you know, this year and even next year, we're kind of at a cap for our CIP match, I don't see match in those areas of the account. And so one of the things that I would ask this commission to consider is a potential match with the funds that we have available if this is something that you want to push forward with, with the Iowa American Water Fund. So we currently have an Iowa american water fund that I want to say has over 200,000 in this commission. Put that to the side specifically for a project, and not necessarily this kind of project, but a project to. I'm trying to think of the words, Dee, you could probably help me. Like, it's. It's really more like a long term thinking, long term development kind of. And so because I believe that we are probably tapped out on the CIP side of things, this would be something that I. I would ask for discussion and consideration on. And I would ask because if the farmers market is going to produce a grant, they want to have support for that, and they haven't asked for a specific amount by any means. Some of that might depend on the grant itself, and we can look further into that, but I don't want to lead them to believe that they could get any type of match if there isn't a general consensus for something like that. So this was about $100,000. Is that what it was? Yes, at the time. What is it now? Yep. So we would. So two years ago. You're right, though. Two years ago it was. And I'd have to pull. We do have an actual quote, so I would have to pull the quote, but I do want to say that it was around 100,000. I really am not really keen on using that money, you know. Cause it's hot in our hands. I mean, we kind of restricted it because we knew it could easily fly out again. You know, they're playing maybe $4 a square foot or something. Really, really half the price of everything else that's in the building. And I just feel like at this point in time, with everything we're doing to try to get whole for them, this is kind of a hard stretch for us. And, you know, if they came up with 20,000 and looked for an $80,000 grant, as in the farmers market, but I know it's our improvement. I totally get that. But I guess I'm just trying to weigh this.

something like that. So this was about $100,000. Is that what it was? Yes, at the time. What is it now? Yep. So we would. So two years ago. You're right, though. Two years ago it was. And I'd have to pull. We do have an actual quote, so I would have to pull the quote, but I do want to say that it was around 100,000. I really am not really keen on using that money, you know. Cause it's hot in our hands. I mean, we kind of restricted it because we knew it could easily fly out again. You know, they're playing maybe $4 a square foot or something. Really, really half the price of everything else that's in the building. And I just feel like at this point in time, with everything we're doing to try to get whole for them, this is kind of a hard stretch for us. And, you know, if they came up with 20,000 and looked for an $80,000 grant, as in the farmers market, but I know it's our improvement. I totally get that. But I guess I'm just trying to weigh this. You're thinking that we would be three entities, the downtown partner association, the farmers market, and us as a commission, we would kind of go together to write a grant. Okay, that's what I thought. And the other thing I'm asking is, I've written grants for our veterans Memorial park, and through the scratch, their policy is you do it and then they reimburse you. Whereas the Davenport casino, the RDA, they fund it up front. So why wouldn't we consider that? We could consider either or. I think really what I'm asking is, would we have any type of consensus for supporting them in any type of monetary capacity for a grant? My thought is, if we're going to be maybe 10% of those hundred thousand, so it's 10,000. I would like you to come back in our operating budget and show us where that is. I don't think we want to. This 240 or whatever we have there, nickel and diamond out. I mean, that was why we kind of pocketed it away. So I think that I'm not. No, I just think that we need to look, and you wouldn't need it till next year's budget, what we want to do there. I do think this is an important project, though. I think it's an important improvement for that ongoing thing that's tremendously popular. We get a lot of people down there, and for those vendors to have electricity, I think it's a tremendous, positive thing. But, I mean, they already. I'm not saying we need to some other events, so that might even lend it to. You could do more events if there is power available. I mean, I'm just thinking back a couple years ago, the summer concert series that was down at the blanking at Quinlan court. Thank you. I mean, if that was there, you've already got people who are coming to this area. Yeah. Remember, it's a parking lot for a baseball stadium, too. It is, but I mean, they don't play every night of the week. No, they don't. No, they don't. There could be something, I don't know, beyond we need to fund it out of our funds. I'm saying I'm willing. I think my stamp on this is that I'm willing to move forward to try and write a grant. Not necessarily use our funds, but to write a Grant. And that's really what you're asking, isn't it? And some of the matching, I think you should need to figure out what it is, negotiate with them, and realizing that, you know, to me, if it's ten or $15,000, we should be able to figure it out in our operating budget. And that's not an overwhelming thing. You can have a grant written for $100,000 to pay for the whole thing, and it's issued in a couple of years, like 50,000 this year, 50,000 the next year. They can structure it like that. Almost always want to match, though. They want. What I'll do is I will go back and we will explore our grant options. So I think that would be really helpful to come back with some grant options. And so maybe. And I'll just use Grant. A. Grant A requires a 20% match or a 10% match. Grant B is 100% funded. Grant C is a split fund, you know, but you. Between multiple entities. But I think. Yeah, at least what I think I'm hearing is that you are open to exploring different options. And then once you have additional information, you would be willing to have further discussion. I'd say that's it. Yeah. I would rather take that tack than thinking about that pool and, you know, if we. Same thing with the patio at Ethiopia, I mean, it's, the community foundation has like a riverfront attraction and somebody has some money there. It's sort of like you need to delve into those different options when you come back with that, can you also have the scope of work because maybe other people know what it is. Oh, no, we don't really. Yeah. We know it's electricity. I mean, electrifying the parking lot, I can just. What parking lot I can throw. Well, for example, the farmer's market, many of those vendors, they need electricity to run the generators, to keep their food heated up and things like that. I mean, I get the concept. I'm just looking for the scope of work. No, I think that would be really, really good to. That was part of the bid as well. You'd have to use that to do the bid. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. We will bring that back. Cool. Yep. So that you will see, I don't have anything for you today. We are going to go ahead and similar to what I described earlier, we'll, their legal team will review. We can look at when the last time it was increased and then the pricing and bring that back to you. So you will see some type of draft from me emailed to you in the next. And I want to say that that particular lease isn't up for renegotiation until, or isn't up for renewal until the end of April. I want to say, like, May 1 is there. Oh, of this year? Yes. Yep. So we're just trying to bring them to you a lot sooner so that you all have an opportunity to read through those. This is the gravel lot. That's west of Marquette. Two lots with us. So you're correct. We did renew the previous one just a few months ago, and then we have the other one up for renewal in May.

So you're correct. We did renew the previous one just a few months ago, and then we have the other one up for renewal in May. Where's the other one located? I would honestly have to look at a map off the top of. I'm thinking of the one that we just did, and I'm not. I can't remember. That's okay. One's down by that old gas station and one's across from Kraft. Right. Former craft. A lot of former things. Yes. They're both on River Drive, not far from where they're doing the project. Right. Yeah, there's one lot there. It's farther down, like kind of cross from the cemetery. Do contract work? No, no, that's gas station, car lot, whatever. Gotcha. Denied taxidermy. All right, well, great. We'll look forward to seeing those attachments or seeing it next. What about facilities maintenance? Yes. So I. We will have a much more lengthy update next month, but just wanted to keep you in the loop on a few things for James to facilities maintenance. So right now, we are meeting with all of our tenants. So this includes myself, lieutenant, and then our senior operations manager of facilities maintenance. So, Eric, we are all meeting together with our tenants and going through writing all of the conditions that would pertain to whichever contractor is awarded for the roof. I want you to know that our tenants have been very happy to meet with us prior to work being started so that we can hear them out in terms of, like, hours of operation, when. When roofing needs to conclude, when it can begin. And, really, that was something that. That I would say. So. Eric and I have a lot of experience working together. We often meet early on before we start a project to discuss some of those things. But our tenants have just shown immense gratitude, and it's been a good way for us to just meet together once a year and talk through how things are going in person. Those meetings have gone really well. We've had our meeting with the farmers market already, as well as front street, and then we have our meeting with the diner and. And Antonella's early next week, I believe. So, like I said, just going over some of these fine details on access points, actually mapping out where we can park our. Or have the vendor park their trucks, where we can actually, like, fence off certain material. So, again, our tenants have a voice in helping us craft those specs, if you will, before we go out to bed. And our hope is that by doing this ahead of time and then also inviting them to the construction meeting, that we have very clean lines of communication. That's really, really important to us. We actually approached this same kind of concept as we were. We are currently repairing the parapet wall over in the farmers market area. And it's just. It has. And you could ask Missy. I don't need to speak for her, but it's gone really, really well. And I think it's been because we have the project, and she's involved, and so she's talking to Missy day in and day out, and then if Missy has any questions, she knows to, like, reach out to me directly so that I can communicate with Ann. So there's very clean lines of communication. So, yeah, that's. That's what we have going on right now. Again, we'll have quite a few. My hope is either be not next month, the following month, the budget is approved, and at that point in time, we'll be able to look at our CIP projects that will hopefully move forward, fingers crossed, in this next fiscal year. So we've got a lot of them, and also some of the. I just want to say that the windows in the farm market. Stunning. Yeah, I saw them for the first time like a week or two ago. Yeah. Beautiful. So that. I'm really glad that you brought that up. They are. They're beautiful. And just so you all know, the farmers market actually submitted a grant for those themselves and then executed that with us. So we had a project manager from public works assigned to it just to understand what's happening. But for the most part, yeah, they really did a wonderful job. That. All right, up next, it's. We're going a little long, but it's worth it because we got to hear from Chris, and his Parkley is on report. I'll try and be brief. We heard a presentation and had a long discussion with some neighbors from the Windsor Crest neighborhood. This has nothing to do with riverfront. They really want the city to take the land that's for sale at 46 and eastern and make it a city park in a huge area of Davenport where there are no city parks, which is everything. East of Brady, south of 53rd, and north of Kimberly, all the way to the border. There's no parks in that whole area where a lot of people live. So staff is looking into the feasibility of that. Does the city own that property? No, the school district does, and it's currently for sale. And they're really worried somebody's going to get it before anybody can even get on that. So that's being looked into by park staff. It's bigger than a normal neighborhood park, so it'll be interesting to see. There were a lot of interesting discussions, like, if a developer did want it, maybe they could take 15 of the 20 acres and leave five acres for wha", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Farmers Market\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Tenants have shown immense gratitude for meeting prior to work being started.\",\n            \"Meetings have gone really well with tenants.\",\n            \"Repairing the parapet wall has gone smoothly with clear lines of communication.\",\n            \"Windows installed in the farmers market are stunning and beautiful.\",\n            \"Farmers Market submitted a grant for window installation and executed that project successfully with Public Works.\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"buy\",\n        \"comment\": \"Strong tenant satisfaction and successful project execution indicate a well-managed and positively regarded entity.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Front Street\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Tenants have been very happy to meet prior to work being started.\",\n            \"Meetings have gone really well.\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"buy\",\n        \"comment\": \"Positive feedback from tenants suggests a well-operated and investible property.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Diner\",\n        \"positives\": [], \n        \"negatives\": [], \n        \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n        \"comment\": \"No specific positive or negative information was mentioned.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Antonella's\",\n        \"positives\": [], \n        \"negatives\": [], \n        \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n        \"comment\": \"No specific positive or negative information was mentioned.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Kraft (former)\",\n        \"positives\": [],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n        \"comment\": \"No specific positive or negative information was mentioned.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Windsor Crest neighborhood\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Presentation and discussion with neighbors indicate community engagement.\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n        \"comment\": \"Details about investment opportunities are still being assessed.\"\n    }\n]", "esg_v1": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Facilities Maintenance\",\n        \"observations\": [\n            {\n                \"observation\": \"Tenants have been very happy to meet with us prior to work being started so that we can hear them out in terms of hours of operation, when roofing needs to conclude, when it can begin.\",\n                \"classification\": \"S\",\n                \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"observation\": \"Our tenants have a voice in helping us craft those specs before we go out to bid.

So that's being looked into by park staff. It's bigger than a normal neighborhood park, so it'll be interesting to see. There were a lot of interesting discussions, like, if a developer did want it, maybe they could take 15 of the 20 acres and leave five acres for what's a normal size neighborhood park, because obviously, parks has a lot of parks to worry about. And then we were introduced to the new senior parks manager, replacing Betsy Tubbs, who just retired, who had been around for a long time, million years. I didn't. I didn't say that. You said Billy Fisher is the new senior parks manager. And the only other thing I really had to mention is there's a Davenport trails committee kind of in the works. I don't have a lot of details. One of our other. Well, my former liaison, Mike shirts on the parks advisory board seems to be spearheading that for us. But I'm going to get involved once it's. Well, as much as I can trails. Like recreational trails? Yes. Bike trails. Yeah. I'd be curious to hear more about because. Yeah, no, I mean, it's something that Mike and I both have been real passionate about. It's exciting that the city is, and that's not part of parks. So it gets this weird thing where that's part of, like, natural resources. But obviously, parks is very involved in all the trails. And now that the city is extending some new trails this year and next year, north and south, it's kind of an exciting time for trails. I'm excited to see those kind of commuter more type and less. I mean, the recreation ones are lovely and awesome. And that kind of tied in. Yeah. And that tied in with the potential Windsor crest eastern thing, too, because the new trail going in is kind of paralleling eastern to the west. So I even suggested maybe there's a way to tie that in because, yeah, they. They had a lot of good maps and explanations for why people in that neighborhood have limited access to parks. And so, anyway, any questions for me?

"RIVERFRONT_IMPROVEMENT_COMMISSION"}, {"chunks": [{"start": 0, "end": 5000, "text": "Good afternoon. I'd like to welcome everybody to the May 14 Planet zone commission meeting. City of Davenport, if anybody has a cell phone, you have it on. I'd appreciate if you turned it off. We will start with our public hearing tonight. Commissioner Eickleberry, could you please redroll. Dunlop. Here. Eifkelberry. Here. Hepner. Here. Johnson. Here. A Tallman is excused. Ingram? Present. Manas is excused. Garrington. Schilling. Here. Thomas. Here. Schneider. Here. We have a quorum. Thank you, Commissioner Echelberry. We have one item of new business and public hearing is case row 240. Three is the request of Damports Community School District to vacate West Fifth street between Cedar and Howell street in the third ward. Matt, next one, Laura. All right, thank you. So the request is coming from the Davenport Community School District. It is to vacate Fifth street. So between Cedar street and Howell. So just to the north side you have smart middle school. And then the southern half is the former Monroe elementary school, which was demolished earlier. So the purpose is really to facilitate the redevelopment of smart intermediate. So, Fifth street currently, as it sits today, it allows for two way traffic, both east and west, and it has head in parking on both sides of the street. And it functions more so as like a parking lot for the schools rather than maybe like your standard street parking might. And the subject area, it's just under an acre. So smart middle School has been working with a team of developers to generate a concept plan for the redevelopment and how the site might facilitate. So they have explored options to preserve Fifth street. However, that has led to some challenges, being the significant increase in building height that would be required so that zoning district only has a building height of 35ft. So having less land to span across would result in additional floors. There would be challenges with phasing the construction around the existing building and lack of site amenities on one half of the block. And then there's also safety concerns if they were to keep Fifth street in place. So this concept, which saves Fifth street, would put all the site amenities on the south half of the block, resulting in students having to cross the street throughout the day. So therefore they've proposed a design. It would involve demoing most of the existing smart middle school. However, they keep the gym and then do an addition on the other half of the site. So on that right side of the page is the proposed concept plan, showing the building that would span across Fifth street and then the relocation of athletic fields, basketball courts, kind of their parking lot and site design that would function around it. So city staff are looking at the impacts on existing traffic and how that will impact the existing neighborhood. So as it stands today, Cedar street is a one way street between Fourth and Fifth going north. It does allow for parking on both sides of the street. Howells street between fourth and fifth is one way southbound, with street parking just on one side. And that's a pretty narrow street, it's only about 20ft wide. And then of course you have Fourth street, which is one way heading west, and then you have two way traffic pretty much north of Fifth street. So the surrounding area is zoned residential, surrounded by single and two family. And then our future land use map has the school as civic and institutional, surrounded by residential general. And then there's also urban corridor along Fourth and Fifth street, and then Division street further to the east. So the vacation of public right of way two step process first is to determine if the right of way is needed for a public purpose, and then second, to negotiate and determine the terms of conveyance in terms of public input. Typically we notify people within 200ft of the request, in this case, since it impacts a much larger area. We basically spanned it out about two blocks, from Pine street to the west to division to the east, then going from Fourth street to the north half of 6th street. Then we also published a notice in the Quad City Times. And then a neighborhood meeting was held on May 7 at Smart Middle School. There were only about five people in attendance. More so, just curious about the future plans for the school. And staff have received just one phone call in response to those letters. That resident was largely opposed to just general development at the school. So for today, it's to hold the public hearing and then a formal staff recommendation will be provided at our next meeting on June 4. Thank you, Matt. Commissioners, any questions of staff at this time? Seeing none, is there anybody in the audience that care to step forward and express your opinion or ask a question? Say none.

Commissioners, any questions of staff at this time? Seeing none, is there anybody in the audience that care to step forward and express your opinion or ask a question? Say none. So we do have the petitioner's architect here. So it's John Hann with the Bray architects. If you have any questions about the project, could you step forward and give just a brief overview of what your ultimate goal is with the school? Just to enlighten the commission? Yep. So could you identify yourself? John Manbray architects. We are working with the district. They are in the process of doing about $160 million worth of facility improvements throughout the district. Smart Middle School was one of handfuls, about seven projects that are going to be occurring. Smart middle school, the original building was built in 1914. The arrangement of the building, the size of the classrooms are just really not conducive to today's level of education. Also, there's a pretty big sentiment in the district that buildings on what we would call the lower west side of Davenport don't get a lot of attention. So it was really important to the district to put a strong message that you are important, your students matter. We want to make an improvement to the building. So smart middle School was identified as one of those improvements. The building doesn't lend itself to be adapted well. So what really became the best solution was to look to create an expansion that would let us build a new building, essentially, and keep the old one operational during construction. But to do that, as Matt stated, it has to extend across that fifth street right of way. What it does is it allows us to park all of the support spaces for educational. So your art, music, library, cafeteria space, kind of stretching in the middle portion of that plant. The upper portion of the plan is our PE and physical education spaces. And the very bottom portion of the plan is a house model for education. So it's a three story building. There's two houses per grade level. Each house is sort of its own self contained unit. And what that does is it lets us take a big population of students, bring it into a smaller scale, so there's a lot more interaction between student teacher. It's really an effort to help improve the quality of education, improve the outcomes of the students as they move through 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. This development plan was arrived at for the purpose of really getting that quality of education improved, but also improved logistics in the area. They know with having had two buildings across the street from each other, site logistics are a problem. So access into the campus was a big thing. So all of the site plan is arranged so that traffic gets off of the streets. So parking lots have drop off lanes to the bottom, to the center, and then at the top is a small bus loop. So buses and vehicular traffic get off of the city streets and onto the property so that we don't congest them as much as we have in the past. Having all the amenities that the kids use right in front of the building, so that's a grass field for PE and athletics, as well as some hardscape for PE and extracurriculars. Being in front of the building just helps the safety and security so those students aren't moving across the street to get them. But it also puts a lot of eyes out there for supervision. So the building faces those. That is the front door of the building that you're going to drive through those pieces. That is an effort to just help with control and safety at the middle school level, give the kids a chance to bolt, and they will. So if we sent them across the street to a different campus, they're probably going to leave. And I don't mean that facetiously. Kids are hard at that age. The other piece of this is we have plenty of opportunities for parking, for events. We have plenty of opportunities for green space and landscape around this building. So we feel that we take a lot of burden off of the neighborhood, but we're going to beautify it as well. So the general approach is that we're going to have a bright, beautiful new building down here with the intent that it does something to improve education. But we're really hoping it injects some feeling of something better and a little higher quality down in the west end and maybe it sparks just some interest and better development down at this portion of the city. Thank you very much. I was very impressed with the presentation that was brought forward at the neighborhood meeting and the enormity of the project. Can you let the commission know the rough budget of what this involves, just to show how much money is being invested in the west end? This is approximately a $50 million investment just on this campus. Impressive. It's not a small investment. No, I appreciate that. Information commission. Anybody have a question for Brazil? Representative, any questions? See none. Thank you very much. I appreciate your attendance tonight. Thank you very much. Final call for questions of staff. Would anybody else in the audience like to speak? I have one quick comment, and that we will acknowledge that there are utilities in Fifth street.

Thank you very much. I was very impressed with the presentation that was brought forward at the neighborhood meeting and the enormity of the project. Can you let the commission know the rough budget of what this involves, just to show how much money is being invested in the west end? This is approximately a $50 million investment just on this campus. Impressive. It's not a small investment. No, I appreciate that. Information commission. Anybody have a question for Brazil? Representative, any questions? See none. Thank you very much. I appreciate your attendance tonight. Thank you very much. Final call for questions of staff. Would anybody else in the audience like to speak? I have one quick comment, and that we will acknowledge that there are utilities in Fifth street. It is the school district's plan to vacate those and they the plan would be for the existing smart school to be in operation during construction. So there'll be some temporary relocation so that school can be in operation still during construction. But the plan for any kind of infrastructure that is in place would be to remove it. Sounds like a bunch of extension cords. Thank you, Laura, for that extra information. Commissioner Johnson, thank you. Nope. I just thought of one quick question. So will the one ways still meet head on right in the front of school? It's being evaluated. Cedar Street's wide enough to be two way. How is the challenge? It can be. It's as narrow as 18ft. So it very much is a neighborhood street. I don't think what the school district is planning will drive any additional traffic to howl. Really. So we're evaluating, at least in the short term, what that means for terms of howl. And then if there are future long range plans. We as a city can evaluate that, whether that be possibility of widening or not. Thank you. Thank you. Any additional questions? If not, we'll close row 240. Three.

We have a quorum, mister chairman. Thank you, Commissioner Tallman. Case our public hearing agenda. First item and only item. Case ord 240. Two. Request of the city of Davort to amend section 17.08 of the zoning ordinance regarding billboard regulations. Laura? Thank you. So I want to kind of explain why we're here in the first place. So, back in December of December 13, 2023, city council put a moratorium on billboards into effect. The purpose of that moratorium was to give staff time to evaluate its current billboard code and make any necessary changes as appropriate. So in the moratorium, there's to be no new construction of billboards that expires June 13 of 2024. So, map on the right is showing the billboard locations that we have. Currently there are 73 throughout the city right now. The circles around them are 1500ft. We measure along the street, but it was easier to demonstrate the area via the radial. So I wanted to go over the current billboard regulations with you so you know where we're at right now, and then kind of discuss future, what the problems we've heard are and things like that. So currently, billboards is written into our code as a principal use. It's not a sign, so it is only allowed in four zoning districts currently. So we have c two, c three, I one and I two. Being that it is principal use, we do have principal use standards associated with them. So there's some locational restrictions. So they're prohibited from being visible from the interstates. They're prohibited on local Davenport historic registry of Places. If the sign is less than 300 sqft, it must be a minimum of 100ft from any residential district, and if the sign is over 300 sqft, then it must be a minimum of 150ft from any residential district. So to continue onto that, the maximum sign area for a billboard is 672 sqft. There is some additional allowance for extension areas. That's when they exceed the normal frame of a billboard. So it could be things that have a shape like a head or a light bulb. They're allowed an additional 153 sqft beyond that frame, the maximum height of a billboard structure. Notwithstanding the exceedance area, the extension area is 45ft. It must meet the principal building setback in that appropriate zoning district, all billboards must be separated by a minimum distance of 1500ft. We currently allow up to four billboard sign faces on a structure. They are allowed to be in a v formation. And we don't have a lot of language on electronic billboards, but I wanted to provide you what we have. So we do allow digital billboards. Currently they cannot change more than once every 8 seconds. Static images are and it must have no animation and the transition from one image to the next must occur in 1 second or less. Electronic display must contain a default mechanism in case of it malfunctioning to full black image or to turn off the sign within 12 hours of reported malfunction. So that's the current code regulations that we have in speaking with the council on what their concerns are and some of the concerns that we've heard from residents with the more recent billboards that were constructed as visual distraction from motorists, the visibility or nuisance of lights from residential areas, the digital sign brightness setbacks associated with the signs and the billboard heights. So some potential solutions would be, number one, I think we currently don't regulate the brightness. So that would be something that we would be able to do. We can increase separation distance for digital because they are more intense and you can see them from further away. We can increase the setback. In particular, what I find problematic c two district, so like 53rd street does not have a setback. So that can allow them to get quite close to the street. Reduce the number of zoning districts would be an option. Clearance areas. So what we've been finding to be from the complaints that we receive is when the billboards are on already heavily developed sites and they're hanging over buildings or over parking lots and things like that. So we could say, you can't have a billboard that overhangs a building or something along those lines. I wanted to provide kind of the timeline we're on. So currently, today we're at the public hearing. So this is our normal path forward. So April 16 would be, we will come with a staff recommendation to you, and then you will vote on a recommendation to council. May 1 would be the public hearing at the committee of the whole, and then the first consideration would be May 8, May 22, June 12 would be the third considerati", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"City of Davort\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Proactively evaluating and potentially amending the billboard code to address concerns.\",\n            \"Implementing a moratorium on new billboard construction to reassess regulations.\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n        \"comment\": \"The city is taking steps to manage billboard regulations, which could be seen as a positive move for urban management.

I would like to hear from the commission if they have any additional concerns or something specific to pinpoint that we should be looking at. Laura, I do have a couple of my own personal observations. I understand your discussion is mostly around billboards. What about electronic signs? Digital signs that are specific to a business? Do they fall under any of these regulations? Not these specific regulations. So we call them electronic message signs. They are in the sign code part of the zoning codes. So they're not a use. They're a separate piece of a sign. There are similar regulations related to image. They need to know more than one image per 8 seconds and things like that. It does have some regulations related to brightness in there. You know, now that they've been out for a while, I'm starting to see a lot more failures. Ones that are just bright white with no image. No. Or even worse yet, are the ones that are flat, bright white. Yeah. And, you know, I can think of one on Kimberly that's been this way for a week or ten days. And it's not shut down. It doesn't automatically shut down. You know, I realize that's for the billboards. Right. But I would think we need to address something. I can take a look at the language in there. If you could just let us know where that is and we can contact that property owner. Two or three. And then if we can have that conversation function malfunctioning. Yeah. Yeah, just. And that goes for anybody. If you see some kind of malfunction that's causing. We care about public safety, obviously, and we don't want people distracted while they're driving on the road. So if you have something that you see that needs to be addressed, just let us know. If you were able to provide an address that's best, just so that we can pinpoint it faster and then we can get in contact with that property owner to get that resolved. What about businesses that are. The new fad is putting the bright white light bulbs all around all the windows. Now, I realize they're not flashing, they're not alternating, they're not changing color, but is that we actually. Yes. Thank you for bringing that up. So we do have a zone. We have a code that prohibits outlining building features with lapses. I got a whole list of them. Then give them. We'll address as appropriate. I've been meaning to ask you this. Okay. I've taken up enough time. Commissioner Tallman. Thank you. There we go. Thank you, mister chairman. Laura, just a couple questions I have, during this moratorium, has the city been in contact or had any input from some of these billboard companies to get. I mean, I'm sure they go through this through a lot of communities. And that's the second question I have what are some of the other communities doing in the state? But I guess what kind of input has the city received or seeked while we've gone through this? So we did look at other Iowa communities regulations. We are one of the more restrictive ones related to distance separation. There are some communities that have capped the number of billboards. There are some that say if you want digital, you need to. It's a two to one, so you need to take out two billboards to have one, two static billboards to have one digital. I mean, it kind of runs the gamut. Currently, Bettendorf does not allow digital. There's a couple other communities that don't allow digital. So it kind of varies from community to community. Do some communities only allow them in industrial districts as well? Have you come across that? I don't think any of the ones we looked at do only industrial. A lot of it is a mix of commercial and industrial of some degree. Kind of what I'm thinking, and you guys can provide some level of direction, is it really has to do with the level activity of in and out of a space. Right. And the number of driveways and things. And if you look at districts that are more active, I think you see c two as a very active use district where you have a lot more. They have smaller lots and more smaller retail spaces that I think you could get a little bit more of a safety concern related to a billboard being located there. I don't necessarily see that as a problem in the c three, and I don't really have an issue with them being an industrial, and that's just my professional opinion. I don't know what other people's feelings are on that. And then again, as far as the local billboard companies, you're not hearing any outcry. I'm surprised. I thought there might be a couple here tonight. I'm actually surprised. I think it might be weather related that they're not here. We had been in contact with, there's one, the company that had the newer two that are on 53rd. We'd let him know the moratorium was coming because he had had some interest in another location, too. So he's aware of them. And we said it was largely related to the digital component of that.

I know they're aware of it, but we haven't had any direct contact with anybody other than that. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Thom and Commissioner Heikelberry. So when you bring forth new recommendations, you mentioned that there are areas that have no setbacks and kind of the wild, wild west. Will existing billboard structures be grandfathered in? Yes. Okay. Yeah. The only component that I might consider not grandfathering would be related to brightness. But if they're physically located where they are, their grandfather, we wouldn't do anything to remove that. Thanks. Commissioner Schilling, a couple questions on the electronic boards. So we will not allow any flashing of any lights on the. Correct. Okay. Yeah. And then when you talk about brightness, are you using lumens to determine brightness or how are you determining the brightness? So our current digital sign code uses foot candles. However, we've been doing a lot of research. Led billboards don't actually emit a lot of light. Correct. They look bright, but they are, they don't emit a lot of light. So there's been a couple of pieces of literature from some dot organizations that there's the ability to measure ambient light and only allow a small amount above the ambient light. So that might be the direction that we would be leaning towards. That way it can fluctuate based off of time of day so that when it's nighttime, you're not getting a super bright one. That would be required in order to be able to see it in the day. So it would fluctuate throughout the weather and the time of day. And then my next question, too, is it sounds like maybe there were some concerns or complaints. Were those being brought by citizens or by business owners? From citizens in particular. The two newer ones that came on 53rd, especially while it was under construction, caused some pushback related to those. That was where around that same time, there was one that was installed on Elmore over by the j bar. We never received a single complaint about that one. Thank you, Commissioner Schelling. Commissioner, let's go with Garrington. A couple questions. I assume that the four areas where we have allow steins have a speed limit, a high speed limit, or is it really, is it attached to those areas or attached to speed limits? Is there any question, any thought about adjusting it by speed limit? Anybody? I have not. So really a commercial district on 53rd. Actually 45. Yep. Sometimes you can go that. Sometimes you can't. Kimberly, the same way? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's not a component we've looked at. I think they're kind of correlated. Why we'd have concerns related to those, and that's the areas that we, aside from west of the mall area, where there's a little bit of c three, a lot of that corridor is more c two on both 53rd and Kimberly. So that I. I think I understand where you're coming from on that. Yeah. The next thing I'd like to ask is if the thing, if the sign breaks down, is there any way we can require the person to put it up to remove that sign, or if the company goes out of business and the sign sticking up there, what's our plan for sign removal, other than the city paying for it so we can require maintenance be done? There's a lot of protections over signage. It's been a fairly well litigated matter. So I don't think we would have a lot of pull to have them removed if. I mean, probably don't. Could remove them if their agreement with the billboard company expires and they don't want it there, or if it's in the way and they want to do something else. But I don't think we have a lot to compel somebody to remove something. The. Because it's a principal use, it would follow. Well, signs do, too, but they follow the non conforming use section of our code, which says if it's damaged by something, they have the ability to repair within one year. So I think I understand where you're coming from, and I wish I had a better answer, but I don't think most of these are probably going to go away if a company went out of business. Oh, like the billboard company? A billboard company, yeah. So the majority of the billboards we have are Lamar. I don't think Lamar will be ever going out of business, but I would think they would probably get. I didn't think Sears was going to go out of business either, so likely. I mean, similar to any other kind of property, if it's tied to the. It's not tied to the owner, it's tied to the property itself. So I'm assuming the ownership of that structure would go to somebody else and it would be under their ownership to. To utilize and maintain. If that. If the current billboard company did happen to switch or go out of business or something along those lines. Thank you.

If the current billboard company did happen to switch or go out of business or something along those lines. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Gerrington. Commissioner Hefner. Thank you, mister chairman. Laura. Are you the sign police? Who's the sign police? So our code enforcement officers would be the ones that address them. We, as planners, do help them interpret and explain the zoning code to them as they are working through that. So we have a couple options for reporting. I should buy. I should. There's. I don't know if you've heard of it, but there's cclik fix. It's one of the more efficient ways to do it. And you can kind of see the progress on what's happening with that item. I should bring you guys cards for how to do that. You can either download an app or do it through a website. It's actually pretty convenient. You also can contact the development neighborhood services department. Hilary Bells is our administrative person, and she puts them in and signs them out for to be inspected and follow it up. So somebody's actually watching it. Yeah. I actually think you'd be really surprised how many signs get pulled from right of ways. They all have pickup trucks and they pull. It's like some weird phenomenon. They, like, multiply. Signs in the right of way, get pulled often, and not just by city staff or other individuals that happen to do that. But, yeah. So I don't specifically do it, but I assist. Okay. Yeah. Well, Commissioner Tallman alluded to the billboard lobby, and I'm kind of surprised that they're not here. Nonetheless. Police. One sign I was thinking of that came to mind. I've driven downtown for years. And river drive in Tremont, there's a building there, and I think you and I, Laura, actually worked on it for lynch when they bought that property. The second floor, do you remember there's an advertisement there for years and years and years. How would that be treated? Is that considered a billboard? We were driving Tremont. Yeah. There's a second floor that is. You're heading west right there. There was always an advertisement there. There isn't currently, like, painted onto the building. Correct. Or a vinyl or whatever. Yeah. So you can have them attached to buildings. They don't have to be a freestanding structure. So really, a billboard is. Definer code is an off promise sign. So if they're doing advertisement for a business that's not currently located on the sign, it is considered a billboard. Oh, it is. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So if it's taken down and not replaced with another sign, it wouldn't lose its right to be there because in the downtown, we do not allow billboards. Okay. Gotcha. And then I liked where Commissioner Schilling was going with the brightness of the signs. I think that we should treat these signs, these digital signs. We're going to see more and more of these, I think. I mean, it's a huge, huge outcome of money. But if we treated them like a cell phone, you know, as it's bright outside, they are brighter, and as it goes down, they kind of follow, you know, the circadian rhythm. Rhythm of sorts, I guess. Anyway, that's, that's really all I had. Thank you, mister chairman. Yeah, thank you, Commissioner Hefner, Commissioner Dunlap. Thank you, mister chairman. Just a question about the. Along the interstate, and I see that it's prohibited, and obviously the agriculture probably require agricultural zoning to be allowed, but what are your thoughts as to why the city has chosen to not have it anywhere near the interstate? Is it like a perception thing or. Yeah, so I know that that has been regulated that way for probably over 20 years. I don't know if some of the more senior members on PNZ know exactly when that happened, but I think largely it was done for perception. As you're driving on the interstate, so you don't have situations like when you're driving into Wisconsin from northern Illinois, where you have billboard, billboard, billboard, billboard. So it kind of gives you a more of a scenic view. And that's, I think, the approach that the city has had in the past related to interstate billboards. Sure. I just wonder, with the expansion of the industrial zone, I mean, I guess I don't know where the industrial zone on the north side of 80, how close it comes, whether there's still agricultural pieces there, or whether it would be considered allowed for because it's an interstate, you know, I mean, once you start developing that, then maybe the signs would be more appropriate. I don't know. I was just curious why, you know, because you do see parts of the country, or even coming in on 80, just east of Davenport, where there are some signs in the farm field, just must be outside of the city. So just curious why prohibition and whether that would take pressure off of additional signs that are people are wanting to put in, you know, into the community where the neighbors are, you know, because I can understand why people are concerned when you're living right there and now there's bright signs popping up everywhere that maybe could limit it more if it was so ones.

So I did look a little bit into the Iowa dot's rules, and they now require commercial or industrial zoning, and they always defer to the city's regulation. So if, because we prohibit them from being visible from the interstate, they wouldn't allow one in the city to have import off of the interstate, they don't actually anymore allow billboards in agricultural land. So ones you're probably seeing are likely grandfathered in. And they also require that they can't be zoned industrial and not have something else there. So they treat it more like an accessory to a principal use instead of a standalone principal use. So, yeah, I totally understand where you're coming from on a lot of that, and every city approaches it slightly differently. Thank you. Thank you, commissioner. Any additional questions at this time? Seeing none, final call. Seeing none, I will close case ord 240 two. That will return to us in a couple of weeks. That will conclude the public hearing agenda. We'll move into regular meeting. Roll call, please, Commissioner Tallman. Thank you, mister Chairman. Dunlop. Here. Echo. Barry. Here. Heppner. Here. Johnson. Here. Tallman. Here. Ingram? Present. Excuse. Garrington. Yep. Shelley. Here. Schneider? Excused. Wheel recording. Chairman. Thank you, Commissioner Tallman. City council activity. We had some pretty big ones that just finished, so case ord 240 one, which was the rezoning of the Annie Whitmire campus that passed last week. And we had row 240 one, which is a request of the city to vacate part of marquette up by the old landfill up there. That also passed so that right away has been vacated. And then res 240, I'm sorry, I flipped these around. So I talked about the Annie Wittenberg ones. Res 240 one, they're all zero one. I got confused. So Annie Winnie passed. The other one was the zoning code change to allow bed and breakfast and reception fillies in the CT district. So that also passed. So all of those items have passed. And then I wanted to kind of discuss this with Chairman Ingram related to splendor Estates. I wanted to let you know it was tabled back in August at city council is back on city council agenda because it was tabled. So it goes, doesn't come back to plan and zone. If it was table, it goes back to council and they'll make a decision on what to do with it. The last. Kind of want to refresh people's memory because it's been a while. So what's transpiring? And some of you may see some, I have a couple extra two of what's transpired. So back in it was reviewed by plan and zone on July 18 of 2023. And that was when it was 118 lot. So some things had transpired. The developers come back with a 76 lot subdivision that does fit single family homes in it. So they would be a similar size to, some of them would be the same size as Eastern Avenue farms, which is directly to the west. Some of them would be probably a little bit more closer to prairie Heights sized lots. So a little bit smaller, but so I think that's a positive outcome. So council's picking that back up this cycle. And so we'll see what happens when they vote on it on April 10. Thank you, Laura. Secretary's report. Sorry, missed you, Miss Johnson. Commissioner Johnson, when you say prairie height size lots, do you mean the garage front facing? Yeah. So the newer. The newer ones, the wider lots? Yeah, they're about 7500 to 8000 kind of size. Those all? Any additional questions, Commissioner Dunlap? Thank you. Just understanding the procedure on it. So because it's went previously, it doesn't come, even though the plan is significantly changed from what was previously approved, it never comes back to planning and zoning because the zoning is not changing or. So what happened? It's council's prerogative on what they want to do because it was table of council, it goes back to council. Whatever they decide. They could remand it back to plan and zone. I don't find that likely to happen. But you would get to see the final plat when it would come back. Whenever they do that one. It is a little bit unusual on what happened. This isn't a normal protocol, but it just seems like sort of a weird precedent that if you present a plan that gets voted on here and then you change the plan later on, then you can just circumvent the process of planning and zoning. Right. So the general feedback we've gotten is because it is decreasing its intensity and the overall layout has not changed. They're not changing access points. They're not changing that piece of it. That's why it's not being told that they need to completely resubmit a new one. And so council will make that decision on what happens. Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Dunlop. Any additional questions? Seeing none. Thank you, Laura, for that update. We'll move on to the secretary's report. Move report. Secretary's report has been moved and seconded as printed. All in favor? Signified by. Aye. Aye. Opposed? Same sign. It will remain as stated. Printed comp plan. Anything new, Laura?

As we begin the meeting of the committee, the whole city council meeting like to welcome everybody in attendance. Anybody who's watching with any particular electronic device, respectfully welcome your comments and opinions, but please keep in mind that as you share your thoughts, you're sharing them with your fellow davenporters and anybody throughout the region. We're happy you're participating in your city government, but ask that your participation please reflect the common desire we all share to make Davenport a better place. If you have a cell phone, especially for the folks in here, if you just put it on silent, please, so it doesn't get in the way of anybody talking.

If you'd like to address the council, please address the council as a body and not anyone individually. Same with the staff. Ask that everyone please observe the commonly accepted rules of courtesy, decorum, dignity, and good taste. And please don't disrupt the meeting. We want to hear from everyone. Thank you, Miss Merritt. Is there any city administrator update tonight? Nothing tonight, your honor. Very good. We have five public hearings. One under community development, three under public works, and one under finance. The first one will be community development. Alderman grip will lead. Alderman grip, please. Thank you, your honor. I open the public for year 50, community development block grant CDBG funds. Is there anyone from the public who's here to comment on this item? Thank you, Brian. I'll reread it. I opened the public hearing on the recommended allocations for year 50 community development block grant CDBG funds. Is there anyone from the public here to comment on this public hearing? Step to the lectern. State your name and address rewards. You have five. Gary eklin. I live in davenport, iowa. I don't really know where it's going. I'm not going to speak against any of the agencies that are receiving funds, although I would personally, if it was up to me. No, not for profit would pay anyone more than twice the minimum wage and still have not for profit status. A lot of not for profits pay their executives way over $100,000 a year, which to me is outrageous. People who work in the private sector can work full time and live in complete and total poverty, and yet people who sit at the top of so called not for profit organizations can rake in over $10,000 a month, which to me is outrageous. So if there are any of these agencies that are paying their executives over $10,000 a month, I would speak in opposition to that. I just would also recommend that I know they go to not for profits, and then it funnels through their executives and their employees, and then to whoever they're going to help. I wish some of this money could go directly to people who were, say, in danger of foreclosure because they were crime victims. Is there anyone else from the public here to comment on this public hearing? Seeing no one, I moved to close the public hearing. There's a motion in a second. All in favor? Any opposed? This public hearing has been closed. Back to you, your honor. Thank you, Alderman grip. Next area is public works. Alderman Dunn will lead. Alderman dunn, please. Rick Dunn, please.

They would say, do these exercises, because if your arm and some of this will probably relate maybe to some of this even. But if your arm is like this, you can still feed yourself and drink, and then if your arm becomes like this, then you can't. So, as you know, they will recommend physical therapy exercises. Well, the people who do that get paid a lot of money, but then the people in the nursing homes or the facilities for people with disabilities or personal care attendants who actually do the physical therapy exercises, can do that and live in intense poverty and not qualify for city programs. This is apparently some sort of Americans with disability access improvements. I am all in favor of anything that they spend in the parks or the city for Americans with disabilities access. I do feel the need to point out that one of the arguments that I had with the city was not only did they declare all fruit trees and blueberries illegal in my yard, could you stick to the. Please stick to the idea. I don't know whether they're going to do any wheelchair accessible gardens here, because I'm a big advocate for wheelchair accessible gardens. And if they have the opportunity to do wheelchair accessible gardens anywhere in the city, the schools, the parks, anywhere, I would highly recommend wheelchair accessible gardens. And I would point out that that lawyer declared it illegal for me to build. Mister Eklund. Yes, sir. Please stick to the topic and don't point out anybody that's. Well, let me just say I believe that wheelchair accessible gardens are obviously legal. I called the city when they talk to planting and zoning. If you call the city and you say, you know, I want to build a shed, or I want to build a garden, or I want to grow tomatoes and flower pots, and they will tell you whether they're legal or not. So I would just say, I hope that you all recognize that wheelchair accessible gardens are legal, and if that's part of this project, I applaud it. Thank you. Anyone else seeing none, I moved to close the public hearing. Second. We have a motion in a second. All in favor, say aye. Any opposed? Same sign. This public hearing is closed.

Any opposed? Same sign.

So, public hearing on the plans, specifications, form of contract, and estimate of cost for the skate park improvements project. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item. Please state your name, address, reward. Derek Cornet, 7th ward. Good to have you back, mayor. Missed you. Anyway, last time I saw an estimate for improvements to the skate park, it was over a million dollars. It was like $1.2 million. So I'm sure the estimate's going to go up. Now, do we really need to spend over a million dollars to fix the skate park? I just sit there and look at the place, go down there, and I can only imagine watching the kids there at night. And I know it's a great place for people to go and skate and everything. That's wonderful. But the other things they're doing there, you know, you can see drug deals going down and things like that, and I just don't, you know, we're not picking up on that, so we're not going to do any enforcement and keeping that clean, you know, who wants to go down there and use it? So over a million dollars? I don't think so. So when it comes back, think about it. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public seeing? None. I would move to close this meet or this hearing. All those in favor? Any opposed? I yield the floor back to you, mayor. Thank you, Alderman Newton. Next is petitions and communications with council and mayor. I just have a couple thank yous. I want to thank Alderwoman McGuinness for filling in for me, and then thank Alder woman. I'm sorry, alderman. Grip to come with the chamber and myself and others out to DC to talk with a lot of the departments there to get some grants and our respective enlisted. It was a wonderful meeting.

I'll be in a couple different boutiques on Harrison Street, 563 vintage and Kesha couture. And once again, that'll be a night out with the alderman. March 28, starting at 530. Thank you. Thank you. Helen McKelley, alderman mcGinnis. Thank you, your honor. I wanted to talk about a couple of things that came up at the city council meeting last week with the committee that hall. There was some information claimed that memorandums of understanding, or mous, are not legally binding. And I just wanted to point out that when there is remuneration involved in an MoU, it is legally binding and legally binding in a court. So the information that they are not was incorrect. There can be mous that are agreements between people or agencies to work together on, you know, a strategic plan or something like that. But there are mous that are legally binding. And this was an exchange of services for financial remuneration. I also was the. There was a speaker last week talking about the employment background of our interim city manager. Managed to skip over entirely her educational background in terms of college, which was disappointing. And so it was inferred that somehow this person went from working at a food franchise as a teenager to jobs at City hall. That's incorrect. She holds a master's degree of public administration from Auburn University and a bachelor's of science from Barry College. Now, that's not to say that everybody who works well and has a job has to go to college at all. And there's certainly no shame in any teenager having a job and making their own money. I did it. I know many of the people who are listening in and many of the people who are here tonight also did that. And we had to do it. And so I also don't want to disrespect that, but the fact that it would go from a high school job to suddenly working with missing the six years or so of education is, I'm sorry. Disappointing. And I apologize to Miss Merritt for that. The other thing I wanted to point out was there was a speaker that talked about a term that was used, which is sort of an unattractive term for funding. And it was said at an open budget meeting that seemed to be being attributed to staff. That was, in fact used by an elected official. I don't believe that elected official meant to cause harm with that, but it. Or was malicious, but it was a term not used by staff and it would never be used by staff. I want to. I did not use that term, but I want to apologize that I did not point that out at the time. And I will certainly, if that happens again, take the responsibility of doing that. So thank you very much, your honor. Thank you. McGuinness. Alderman Jobshan. Thank you, mister mayor. A few things here, one a little bit more benign than the other, as I've done on my time on council. If I have a family member, friend, or loved one who happens to have a birthday on the date of a meeting, I shout them out. And I would be in significant trouble if I missed recognizing my wife on her birthday today. So wherever she is right now, I wish my wife, Melissa, happy birthday. Next. Probably a little more importantly, and Alderman Kelly, I apologize. I didn't think this through as well enough, and don't mean to step on your toes with something here, but had some conversations about executive sessions, such to discuss some of the items that we tabled last week. And I threw out a couple dates, and then something else kind of came into my mind. So I wanted to just call a special city council meeting in order to hold an executive session on Thursday, March 28, 2024, at 05:30 p.m. council chambers at city hall to discuss these personnel matters at the request of the employees. All right. Second. Thank you. And I'm done. Mister mayor. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Job. We don't need a vote, because two people said okay to it, so very good. So, mister mayor, if you put that on the. On the schedule. Thank you. Anybody else? And since Alderwoman Newton, I don't know if I missed that, but was there a time for that, for that meeting? 530. Yep. Okay. And in my hearing. 530, I just want to make sure it's clear, so, especially so the public knows, since we're doing a special meeting to go into exec. Is it 530? Yes. I'll say it again. Okay. That's what the two call. Okay. Onward. Jokin, do you have something else? If I need to say it out loud again, I'll say it out loud again. Let's do it. Just to make sure. Just clear.

Is there anyone from the public who's here to comment on this item? Anyone from the council? This item moves on. Before we get into item number four, I'm going to bring up Director Berger to talk about the next four items that are the next four resolutions that are before us. Director Berger, thank you. Bruce Berger, community and economic development. So the next four items are all related to city home funding and kind of a little bit of a just primer on those four. The first one is actually a request for home funding for a LIHTC project, a low income housing tax credit project, sometimes called LiHTC projects. Those are state credits that are usually awarded about this time of year. You apply in the spring. Developers do. They're bigger affordable housing rental projects. The first project listed there is by Vera French mental health center. They actually applied last year. And so they did what is sometimes a bit more common. Developers will apply for those state credits. It's highly competitive. And if they're awarded those credits, that's usually announced in the summer or fall, then they will come forward to the city if they are requesting city home funds. So that's what Vera French is doing and that's what item number four is. They are now coming forward for a project that they were awarded successfully last year at the state level. The next three, five, six, and seven by Commonwealth companies gratis Development and Newberry living are three projects that they're applying for this year at the state level. So they will be applying next month, early April, for liHTC credits. And what they've done is apply early for city home funds to get what we sometimes just call a softer conditional commitment. It's a lot of work to do that, so not a lot of folks do that. That's why those three are on there. The last point I would just mention real quick is that because in January, you all approved a conditional development agreement for the Annie Wittenmeyer campus, which the city owns. And there were two projects that you heard they intend to apply for LIHTC credits in April as well. That is still the case. They've just decided to go with the more common method of not applying for city home funds until after the announcement. So that's why you don't see those on the agenda. And there may be other projects as well that are applying for LIHTC this round that did not apply for city homes. So confusing. If you have any other questions, let me know. Thank you. Director Berger. Resolution number four is conditionally approving the city home funding application for the Carrolls Village apartments housing project in the 800 block of Harrison street. Is there anyone from the public who's here to comment on this item? Step to the lectern. State your name and address, or Ward. You have five minutes. Gary Eklin. And I don't want to speak in opposition to any of these four, necessarily. I don't want to necessarily speak in favor of any of them either. The first one seems, on the face of it, to be a good idea.

Is there anyone from the public who's here to comment on this item? Step to the lectern. State your name and address, or Ward. You have five minutes. Gary Eklin. And I don't want to speak in opposition to any of these four, necessarily. I don't want to necessarily speak in favor of any of them either. The first one seems, on the face of it, to be a good idea. I do want to point out that somehow none of the programs that the city has and the state has encouraged homeownership purchase or renovation or anything for low income homeowners or home buyers. And I have not understood how there are programs around the city where if you're gonna be evicted, they might pay a monthly rent, but if you're gonna be foreclosed on, there's essentially, sir, no one. Do you have anything regarding, specifically the home funding application? Okay, the 800 block to Harrison Street. I was only going to speak once, but if you want me to speak individually to each project, I can do that. Speaking. 800 block of Harrison street. That's an area where a lot of houses were previously demolished. I assume that's around. Well, anyway, I can guarantee you there were a lot of previously demolished houses there. Unless I'm thinking of a different block, in which case they might want to demolish some houses to put this up. But I'm assuming they're thinking of a vacant lot, are an empty space next to an existing building. So if this is some sort of mental health transitional thing, then by all means, that's great. Like I said, I'm really concerned that we have these programs that not necessarily this one, because there's the other three, and I may speak to those, although I was only going to speak once, but low income housing subsidies tend to be landlord subsidies. And that the money doesn't actually go to the person and that allows them to choose where they want to live. It goes to certain landlords who are approved, and hopefully they're all decent landlords. You know, I'm not. I'm not condemning any one of these, but somehow the money never seems to really help the people who need it the most and who are taxed at a far higher rate than they should be, the subsidized people for programs they don't qualify for. So I'll go ahead and stop for a minute, but I may address one of the other ones here. I just think we have a city, a government that is hostile to poor people across the board. And I want to point out that the community economic development person said recently they were talking about the Dream home program, which is housing related. It's similar, I think. I read in the paper that the lowest income that you could be to apply to buy a house from the city of Davenport was $43,000 a year. And if I have that wrong, if it's 33,000, I apologize. But $43,000 a year sticks in my head as low income, the lowest income that the city will help homebuyers. And that leaves out everybody cleaning incontinent people in all the nursing homes. They get to pay extra taxes. I'm struggling to piece this together with. It's an overall housing thing to me. All of the housing is. Are kind of connected and the affordability. But let me just say with 800 Harrison, as far as I know, I would, you know, if I'm going blank on the name again, if Carol's village, if Vera French wants to build housing that people with mental illness can sign up for, I'm all in favor of that. You know, the more houses, the better. So for that, the more houses, the better. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public who wishes to comment on this item? Please step to the lectern. State your name and address. Reward, please. You have five minutes. Hi there. My name is Stacey Kaiser Willey. I'm the executive director for Vera French housing, and I live in Wilton, Iowa. Actually, I just want to say thank you to the city of Davenport and the city staff that have worked with us for many months to bring this application forward. Also, thank you to Marian, who's also been a strong advocate. And these low income housing tax credits enable us to keep the rents very low to help people that need affordable housing. And so we're very thankful to the city of Davenport and very appreciative to allow us to be able to do this. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public here to comment on this resolution? Seeing no one. Is there anyone from the council? Alderwoman McGinnis, thank you. If I could ask you to come up again, please, ma'am. So I know that in your role, certainly in your role of working with Vera French, if you just briefly talk about what you offer to people across the quad cities and your units, you could do that. I was going to say my CEO is here, Doctor Richard Whitaker as well. Please. Come on, sir. But veer, fringe housing. We've been in existence since the early nineties. We offer scattered site housing with supports, of course, because we're a part of Vera french community mental health center, but also supports in the community as well. Again, we have scattered sites. We also purchased some public housing from the city of Davenport working with Bruce and his team last November. And we stay full because there is a need for housing and there's a need for housing that everyone can afford. And we just, you know, again, appreciate the opportunity.

So I know that in your role, certainly in your role of working with Vera French, if you just briefly talk about what you offer to people across the quad cities and your units, you could do that. I was going to say my CEO is here, Doctor Richard Whitaker as well. Please. Come on, sir. But veer, fringe housing. We've been in existence since the early nineties. We offer scattered site housing with supports, of course, because we're a part of Vera french community mental health center, but also supports in the community as well. Again, we have scattered sites. We also purchased some public housing from the city of Davenport working with Bruce and his team last November. And we stay full because there is a need for housing and there's a need for housing that everyone can afford. And we just, you know, again, appreciate the opportunity. But we do have many apartment buildings. We have multiplex units, duplexes. We also have what some people call group homes, but houses that are staffed for people that need a little bit higher level of care. And also, to answer your question, alderman, my name is Richard Whitaker. I live in Davenport on Emerald woods, and I'm the CEO of Vera French Community Mental Health Center. Vera french community Mental Health center really is the supportive part of permanent supportive housing that we provide through Vera French housing. And those supports include a whole range of services that range from residential all the way down to the most basic outpatient services, home based services, that kind of thing. But it's all about providing supports so that we're not just providing affordable housing or very affordable housing, but supportive affordable housing, which means that it's safe and it's comfortable and it's a good place for people long term, because the folks who we typically see in our housing have some challenges that they need some support from time to time, sometimes a lot of times. And Vera French does that regardless of ability to pay. Thank you very much. And thank you for the work you do. If I could. If I could, please, Mister Bruce, if you could come up as well, just for a second. I think we had this conversation recently, but let's go through it again, and I don't want to put you on the spot, but could you talk a little bit about the programs that the city is involved in or involved with community partners, with housing, single family homes as well, please? Sure. So the home dollars that we're talking about here, as well as CDBG, we can use to assist a number of different programs. And actually, it's a good reminder that here in a couple weeks we're going to do a little work session on that as well to kind of let you know what some of the programs we have in terms of neighborhood reinvestment, but in terms of homeowners specifically, we have an urban homestead program where the city will acquire an abandoned house. Sometimes it was a rental, but it's always vacant. And we'll rehab it and then sell it to a low to moderate income homeowner. We have some down payment assistance programs that assist homeowners with buying a home, and they're exclusively for low to moderate income home buyers, which are at or below 80% of median family income. We have our dream program as a home buyer component. So every year we have up to ten homeowners that have been assisted through that program. That one is in the central city, not limited to just a fort, low to moderate income homebuyers, but it is in the central city, which is low to moderate income area. So that's just a few of some of the programs we have. And also we assist. We've assisted habitat, right, exactly. Yeah. So home, right. Home funds have. We've put those funds into helping subsidize the construction of new homes that habitat for Humanity quad cities builds. And also lots. I believe we've helped assisted habitat with some lots as well. Definitely. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Sorry, Alderman Kelly, thank you very much. If the folks from Vera French will come up, I have a question. I don't know who would answer it. Since 2020, Covid has been upon us and we're now a little stir crazy. And the folks that had mental health issues that didn't have, I mean, they had them, but they were at the back of their head. Now they're at the forefront and they're not as severe as some of these folks are out there. These people are in need of homes, too. So what are your levels of God? I guess I don't know what the correct word of that, the correct wording of that. So I would love to meet with you because I know folks that aren't swinging from the rafters, but, you know, there's issues, and I shouldn't have said it like that, but you know what I'm saying? Because I grew up, I'm aging myself by saying that. But I'm just saying there's folks that are in need, desperate need, and they fight with some of the issues that they have because of COVID and they don't reach out for help. So I would love to sit down and just have a conversation of how can I assist some of these folks in my neighborhood to get into some of your facilities? Yeah, absolutely. We'd love to sit down and tell you more about us. For sure. Thank you. And I think one important feature of Carroll's village gardens is that six units are specifically reserved for individuals recovering from homelessness. And, you know, with all of the supports right next door, and we built it right next to the Carroll center. Right at 808 North Harrison is the Carroll center right next door. 820 is this new property, 30 units. Those are all the supports and services necessary to help people who are recovering from homelessness to get back into the workforce, if they're ready to get the supports they need for their relationships, for their livelihood, for everything they want to bring back into their life that they lost because of mental illness.

What is the timeframe to help them, to assist them to have a place to live? A guaranteed place to live. You mean when with the building open? No, he's saying you help folks from homelessness. So what is your timeframe of helping somebody that's homeless with a guaranteed place to live? Is it six months? Is it a year? Oh, they. No, they can live there as long as they comply with the terms of their lease. So it's something that there's no time frame. There's no time limit. So it'd be a wonderful apartment, just like any of the other apartments that are going to be there. And the other, I think the other thing, too. Maybe you were asking, but fear fringe has a wonderful continuum of care. So the residential care facilities are the two highest levels of care. And then we go down to our hab homes, which some might consider, you know, say group homes, it's more of a common term, but for people that, you know, kind of a step down but still need some staffing, still need some assistance. I have one in my neighborhood. Yeah, yeah. And then the apartment. So like the apartment building in my neighborhood too. So then we have the multiplex, the duplexes and more of the independent component. But still with those supports, those voluntary supports that people can take advantage of. And Carroll's village garden is right next to the Carroll center. If you've never been to the Carroll Center, I urge you to come take a tour. Come see what we're doing. There's a meal people can do, laundry programming. So much assistance there that is available to the community. Right on. Thank you so much. Thank you. Seeing no one else from the council, this item will move on. We'll move on to item number five. A resolution conditionally approving the city home funding application for the enclave at Sheridan housing project in the 5000 block of Sheridan street. Is there anyone from the public? Gary Eklin. Because I've had a lot of jobs and I just want to say too, if anybody is interested about what they were talking about, the Carroll center people, a lot of people. I'm interested in hearing about the resolution conditionally approving the city home funding application. Yes, sir. For the enclave at Sheridan housing projects. I would have been finished already saying that that was the old United neighbors, but okay, I will move on to this because I have had a lot of jobs and some of them were delivery jobs. I've been into most buildings in the city, most apartment buildings multiple times 5000. Sheridan is an existing apartment complex with a whole lot of apartment buildings. No, it's a new 01:00 a.m. i thinking of. I'm getting it mixed up with 53rd 4900. There's a Sheridan. There's an apartment complex behind like the auto zone Sheridan. And apparently I'm getting this mixed up. Yes. Okay, so this is new housing. This would be new housing. Okay, well, that's good. It might mix up for some of what you guys tore down around Palmer and five points. I don't want to speak against new housing. I do have a concern that the city property tax people have explained to me that they charge the lowest income home buyers extra property taxes. We're talking very specifically and I'm very specific. I'm very specifically an application for one project and I am very. I'd like you to stay on that particular. I am very specifically saying that me as a person who has suffered serious financial crime and hardship and is in danger of going on a foreclosure, who pays more than my fair share of my property taxes, I don't think that I should pay extra for so that rich people can have investment properties. Now that may be sounding like I am speaking against this, and maybe I kind of am because you can have two things. I can be in favor of housing and I can be in favor of not forcing poor people to pay for rich people's profits in housing. So I'm kind of conflicted about this one. Like I said, I was mixed up. I thought it was the existing housing that was going to get status. So on the one hand, we need new housing. There's a housing crisis that's been caused by the city and other entities tearing down houses for profit and because they don't like the people who live in those houses. So on the one hand, we need new houses. On the other hand, it's not fair to make the poorest home buyers in the city pay. Not that they do, but if anyone, if anyone on the city council had a conflict of interest when it came to voting for tax benefits for themselves, I would hope that they would announce that from the city council and explain that if they had a conflict, let's say if one of you guys were.

So on the one hand, we need new housing. There's a housing crisis that's been caused by the city and other entities tearing down houses for profit and because they don't like the people who live in those houses. So on the one hand, we need new houses. On the other hand, it's not fair to make the poorest home buyers in the city pay. Not that they do, but if anyone, if anyone on the city council had a conflict of interest when it came to voting for tax benefits for themselves, I would hope that they would announce that from the city council and explain that if they had a conflict, let's say if one of you guys were. If one of you, if one of you people. You are way off topic again. No, I'm speaking specifically to this topic. If one of you people on the city council had a financial investment in this specific property and we're going to benefit from it, I would expect you as a matter of course, to divulge that from, from city hall and say I, Mister Kyle Grip, I have a financial interest in this, this discussion. So I'm going to recuse myself. I'm not saying you do, I believe you probably don't. But if you did have a financial interest in this project, it should be announced from city hall. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public? Good evening. Vice president of Commonwealth Tyler Sheeran, first and foremost would like to thank Bruce and Dawn for their ongoing collaboration as they reviewed Commonwealth's application. And also appreciate your guys time in reviewing our application as well. To Bruce's point, it was kind of atypical for us to submit the application prior to going into the Iowa Finance Authority to request full funding for this project. But it was our preference to kind of have a proactive approach here. And with that, if we are fortunate enough to receive the tax credits that we were seeking this summer, it just puts us one step ahead to be able to get these units online quicker than kind of coming out on the backside. So with that, thank you again. If there's any questions, happy to address them. Thank you. Thank you. If there's any other public good comment first. Is there anyone else from the public who's here to comment on this item? All right. Seeing no one, we'll go to council with comment. Anyone from the council? Seeing no one, this item will move on. And item number six is a resolution conditionally approving the city home funding application for the Fairmount Apartments housing project and the 4300 block of Fairmount street. Anyone from the public here to comment? Gary Eckland. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe these are existing units. These are new units, too. 4300. It's up by the school. Is it on the other side right now? There's existing apartments between what once upon a time was a Kmart and grade school. There's existing apartments in there. So this would maybe be on the other side of the grade school. North of the grade school. Perhaps. Maybe. Maybe not. Again, I have a concern about making the poorest people pay for wealthy people's investment properties. And that's been the situation. Now, I know, mister, the head of the economic community and economic development project, the head of the community and economic development whatever, and an alder woman had a back and forth about some supposed assistance for low income housing. I still don't see it. What I see is the low income people in the city of Davenport paying to subsidize wealthy people. Instead of wealthy people paying to subsidize and help poor homeowners. Because I tell you what, if the city had a motto, city had one. Community and economic development, city hall, everything, it would be. The job of the city is to come down hard on the lowlifes on behalf of the higher. Do you have any comments related to this video? Very specific project. I specifically. They've already raised my property taxes far above what they're supposed to be. I should not have to pay for wealthy people's investments. Thank you for your time. Is there anyone else from the public who wishes to comment on this item? Please step to the lectern. State your name and address award, please. You have five minutes. Hi. Danielle Welch Massey with gratis development. I live in Indianapolis, Indiana. Happen to be in Davenport. My parents live in Davenport, so it's nice to visit them with gratis development. We are proposing this new construction development. It will be to clarify. It will be across the street. From the existing apartments. So it's currently an undeveloped lot here to answer any questions for anyone, or if you just want to talk after the meeting, you can catch me then. Thanks. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public here to comment on this item? Anyone from council? Alderman Kelly? Young lady, before you sit down, help me. Help me understand this. You said the existing apartments. What are you talking about? So there's existing apartments called Fairmont Pines. Is that the one that they just renovated? I'm not sure if they just renovated. It is right next to Buchanan, across the street. Across 43rd street? Yep. Those were the whole projects. So this will be across fair amount. Okay. And there's a large parcel that's undeveloped. And so we have a purchase agreement for a portion of that parcel. Thank you so much. Seeing no one else from the council, this item will move on. And then we have item number seven, which is a resolution conditionally approving the city home funding application for the priester building housing project at 601 Brady street. Is there anyone from the public? Gary Eklin. I don't know who owns this, if it's still owned by two wealthy lawyers. And maybe I'm wrong on that, too, because I do make mistakes and I didn't do any research. But if wealthy people own this building and they're putting it in as an investment to increase, everybody who's worth a million dollars wants to be worth $10 million, and I don't blame them.

And it's particularly annoying to look at 601 Brady and to think that this does not come close to making up for the houses that the city of Davenport and Palmer demolished. And I will stop there. But poor people should not have to pay to subsidize rich people. Is there anyone else from the public who wishes to comment on this item? Is there anyone from the council seeing. No one. This item will move on. We'll move on to item number eight. I'm going to bring up director Berger once again to give some insight onto items number eight and item number nine. And then we'll go through the process of discussion on those ers. Berger, community and economic development. Again, these two, eight and nine actually are part of the same project. Everything. I'll back up a step. The analysis of impediments for fair housing and the housing needs assessment are two things that HUD requires. Entitlement communities who receive CDBg funds, like the city, to do every five years. So every five years you need, cities across the country need to do these, these two analysis pieces to allow for a five year planning process. And that's what you do when you apply for community development, black grant funds. So it's time again to do that. Probably ten years ago, I think, was the first time that we started working with both Moline and Rock island. And so Bettendorf is not an entitlement community, so they don't receive CDBG funds annually. Three of the four quad cities do. And we found that if we band together and get on the same five year cycle, it actually can save some funding. So the last couple of times, the city has been the lead. The city of Davenport has been the lead, and we've requested quotes. And then we entered into intergovernmental agreements with Rock island and Moline. This time Moline is in the lead. They went out for quotes. We have two good consultants. They're partnering together, but they're each getting paid individually. So the city of Moline has set that up with separate contracts. Those dollar amounts are below $50,000 in terms of the city's commitment. So it doesn't actually meet your normal standard to have it be a separate resolution. But because we need to have a 2080 agreement, they're both on your agenda separately. So that's what those are about. Glad to answer any questions, if you have any. Thank you, Director Berger. We'll start with item number eight, then, which is a resolution approving an intergovernmental agreement among the city of Moline, Illinois, the city of Rock Island, Illinois, and the city of Davenport, Iowa, to complete a regional housing needs assessment. Is there anyone from the public here to comment on this item? Anyone from the council? This item moves on. Item number nine is a resolution approving an intergovernmental agreement among the city of Moline, Illinois, the city of Rock Island, Illinois, the city of Davenport. Sir, can you sit down, please? Thank you. I'll reread a resolution approving an intergovernmental agreement among the city of Moline, Illinois, the city of Rock Island, Illinois, and the city of Davenport, Iowa, to complete an analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. Is there anyone from the public who's here to comment on this item? Please state your name and address, or. Ward, you have five minutes. Gary Eklund. This is an analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. That is very, very rich for the Davenport city government to be looking into an analysis of impediments to fair housing when in the city of Davenport, there's no greater impediment to fair housing than the city. To quote. We have different rules for lowlifes in low life neighborhoods and higher class citizens in higher class neighborhoods. That's the official position of the city's code enforcement department for the last three years. No greater impediment to fair housing than the city of Delaware. All right, thank you. And David Anderson, fifth Ward. I studied this as much as humanly possible. The only thing I really wanted to comment about is the no bid on this project declaration and the paperwork, because I'm a paperwork etiquette and protocol kind of guy. The pages agreements with no bids. The blank exhibits, Ab. Totally blank. More importantly is what I found. Mullein bedsheet. I lived in Moline for a very long time. Followed them. They are quite excellent. Kind of like it better here. Also those day at cost and budget cheap cost savings and projects bundled. This is absolutely fantastic for 78,003 different figures.

And our final item in community development is motion approving the allocations for year 50, community development block grants, CDBG funds, and home investment partnership funds. Anyone from the public here to comment this item? Anyone from the council? This item will move on. Alderman Reinerts, will you please set our agenda? Thank you. I make a motion to place items one through eleven on the consent agenda. There's a motion and a second. All in favor? Aye. Are there any opposed? The agenda has been set back to you, your honor. Thank you, Alderman Griffin. Alderman Reinertz, the next area is public safety. Alderman Jobshin and Alderman Tim Dunn will discuss. Alderman Jobshin, please. Thank you, mister mayor. First item under the public safety agenda is a resolution approving street lane and public ground closures requested. Excuse me. Requests on the list of dates and times for outdoor events.

Judith Lee second word I would just like to ask. This is going to be another a lot of people downtown, and during the St. Patrick's, there were people parked on the grass at 324 Main street and I would just, and there's pictures on the Internet. They basically filled up the grassy area. So I would like to request the city to make sure that that area is not used for parking for anything going on downtown. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else? Public motion to comment on these items? Anyone from council seeing none that item will move on. Item number two motion approving beer and liquor license applications. I'll read those under section a, new license, new owner, temporary permit, temporary outdoor area, location transfer, etcetera. First RME courtyard, 121 West Second street, outdoor area. Recurring temporary license, license type, class C liquor on premises. Next assumption high School, 1020 West Central Park Avenue. Recurring temporary event license type, class C liquor on premises. And then we have those items on section b, license renewals, which I do not read, but they're there for review. Is there anyone from public wishing to comment on any of these items? Anyone from council? Welcome. Alderman Tim Dunn. Yeah, I'd like to talk about the item with the Hawkeye sports and bar. Bar and grill. I just received an email the other day, and one thing that stands out on that email is, out of 71 calls to the Danport Police Department, 56 of those calls were without any issues. 56 out of 71. It's kind of ridiculous. We got a lot more things to do with the downport police department than to waste our time. If I could, if Chief Boydel could step up and give me any information he has on this issue. Mayor, elected officials. Jeff Lydle, your chief. Yeah.

And then we have those items on section b, license renewals, which I do not read, but they're there for review. Is there anyone from public wishing to comment on any of these items? Anyone from council? Welcome. Alderman Tim Dunn. Yeah, I'd like to talk about the item with the Hawkeye sports and bar. Bar and grill. I just received an email the other day, and one thing that stands out on that email is, out of 71 calls to the Danport Police Department, 56 of those calls were without any issues. 56 out of 71.

If I could, if Chief Boydel could step up and give me any information he has on this issue. Mayor, elected officials. Jeff Lydle, your chief. Yeah. As a part of the licensing renewals each year, we do do a review of calls for service, and we usually go back a year for each establishment. But for this establishment in particular, my numbers are a little bit different. So I'm curious to where yours came from. But 23 calls for service is what we had in a year time period there. Three disturbance calls, eight noise complaints, three disturbance calls were one fight between two people. The other were two people wanting to be removed from the establishment. So the establishment has called on all those. They initiated those calls. When we compare calls for service from all of our establishments, when we look at these licensing, this does not compare anywhere close to a lot of the other stabilizations we're dealing with. And I can just give one example. One example that we just went through a public discussion on is about 168% higher in calls for service than this particular establishment. Thank you. Can I call up Nicole Gleason? There was an issue on some lighting out there also. Good evening. Nicole Gleason, public works director. So it's my understanding I wasn't there personally, but last August, there was a meeting between elected officials, staff in mid american energy, reviewing those lights, and some repositioning of the lights was done to make sure it was directed appropriately on the facility. But as a follow up measure, because we still have received a few complaints, we are going to have a third party just give it another review just to make sure everybody's on the same page. Thank you. Thank you. Back to you, mister Jojo. Thank you. Anyone else from council? Alderman Kelly. Thank you. I appreciate it. Chief Bladel. Thank you, sir. I appreciate your time. So I'm having a problem with your numbers compared to the numbers. Cause I'm like Rt. Dunn. I received an email too, so it's interesting to me when stuff doesn't jive up. So I need to know and I need clear, who do we get this information from? Can we get it directly from the police department or do we need to have it filtered down to us? You can directly ask me and I'll make sure you get it. But for that year time, it could be just that they ran a different time period. So we usually run a year time period when we're looking at renewals of licenses. And that's what this was from March 19, 2023 to March 18, 2024. Okay. I just wanted to know that I can actually reach out to you to get this information that I'm in need of. I could be patty, but I'm not going to. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Anyone else from council seeing? None. Then I would ask Alderman Tim Dunn to please set our agenda. I would like to make a motion to put items on public safety to the consent agenda. Second. We have a motion. A second. All in favor? All opposed? Same sign that closes public safety. Mister mayor, back to you. Thank you, Alderman Jobshin. Alderman Tim dunn. The next series, public works, Alderman Rick Dunn and alderman Kelly will discuss. Alderman Rick Dunn, please. Thank you, your honor. Item number one is the first consideration of an organ submitting chapter 12.16 entitled Curbs of the Municipal Code of Davenport, Iowa, by eliminating sections and updating language. And before I ask for public comment, can we have the city engineer come up here and give us an overview of what's going on here? Brian Schatz, the engineer. The currency code reads that the curbs are the property maintenance of the adjacent owners. That would mean anything that would have to occur. They would have to go ahead and fix that at a 50 50 cost. In consideration that the curb acts as a part of the street as well as a drainage device, we would recommend that the code be updated so that that portion is taken out and it would be a property maintenance of the city. Perfect. Thank you. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Council seeing on this item. We'll move on and I'll read the next two items and call them back up to ask first. Item number two is the first consideration of ordinance amending section 13.34.130 entitled Storm Sewers of the municipal Code of Davenport, Iowa by updating language for the storm sewer inspections. And then item number three is the first consideration of an ordinance amending section 16.28.050 entitled Sewers of the Municipal Code of Davenport, Iowa, being language for sanitary sewer inspections and sewer extensions. Could you give us a little brief update on this one as well? Within these two sections, they currently read that any privately constructed sewer, which would be any sewer as part of a residential subdivision, commercial or industrial, must be televised by our own sewer crews. We would like to modify that language to allow developers to go ahead and televise that using a private contractor utilizing our specifications, as well as making sure everything was clean. Those videos would be given to engineering staff for reviews so we can determine if there are any deficiencies prior to making recommendation for approval. Thank you.

Is there anyone from the public wishing to address these two items? Council seeing none of these two items. Move on.

Item number seven is the resolution awarding a contract for the CY 2024 contract milling program to Porter Brothers construction in the amount of $146,719.24. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Council seeing on this item. We'll move on. Item number eight is a resolution awarding the Damport Municipal Airport five year on call aviation consulting and engineering services agreement to McClure engineering. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Yes, Gary Eckland. I want to speak in opposition to this. I actually want to argue that it's time to shut down the Davenport airport. As anyone who pays attention to the news knows, we have an extinction crisis. We have a climate change crisis and airplanes contribute more to that than far more any other form of transportation. Most of our air travel. If someone wanted to go to New York City or Miami or wherever, they would go to Moline and they wouldn't fly out of Davenport. It's my understanding that Davenport Airport primarily serves corporate jets for really rich people who want to fly in. I remember a few years ago there was a discussion of the Davenport airport and they said that if we close the downport airport down, then corporate executives would not want to come to Davenport because they would have to fly into Boline. And that that was just too much for corporate executives to stand, that they would not come to Davenport, Iowa, if they were forced to fly into moline. But to me, it seems to me like this is for corporate jets and it's for super, super rich people. And that the entire Davenport airport is a subsidy towards rich people, which everybody is forced to pay for. I who haven't flown in decades and don't expect to have to pay extra taxes to subsidize the Davenport airport, which is primarily used by super rich people who should be able to pay their own way and not rely on taxes. And I would suggest that we close down the airport and that we make it not just a trailer park, but a trailer park where the individuals who own the trailers could own the lot so that they would not have to pay lot rent. That would address housing. We get back on the topic. I'm opposed to spending any more money on the Davenport airport because the Davenport airport is a subsidy for rich people who can pay their own way. Thank you. Anyone else? Council seeing on this side, we'll move on. Item number nine is a resolution approving the plan specification form of contract. An estimated cost for the Garfield Park Ada access improvements. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Council, Alderman Kelly. Thank you. I'm excited for this. That's all I want to say. In my neighborhood, I'm liking to see some developments and things going on. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Anyone else seeing none. This item? We'll move on. Item number ten is a resolution proving the plan specification form of contract and estimated cost for the colony Drive Brown street to Gain street reconstruction project. Is there any from the public wishing to address this item? Council seeing on this item, we'll move on. Item number eleven is a resolution proving the plan and specification form of contract and estimated cost for the Colony Drive Western Avenue Ripley street reconstruction project. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Council seeing none. This item will move on. Item number twelve is a resolution proving the purchase of wetland credits from Nahant Marsh and the amount of $298,760 for the water pollution control plant and compost facility, flood mitigation, stormwater and effluent pumping system project. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Council seeing none, this item will move on. And Alderman Kelly, would you set the agenda for us, please? Love to. I'd like to make a motion to move all twelve items to the consent agenda. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Same sign.

Alderman Newton, please. Thank you, Mayor Matson. Tonight, alderwoman lynch and I have seven items to discuss on the finance agenda.

Like I said, I know there's more detail on the Internet for people who have computers and don't suffer migraines as bad as I do. The city administrators work plan. The sentence here, as I read it, is completely meaningless, although, I mean, it does say city administrators work plan, but it doesn't say any details about what the work plan is. And if I'm familiar with the city administrators, any work plan that they have would be to the benefit of people who make over $100,000 a year and to the detriment of everyone else. And I wish there was more detail on this, and I apologize for even speaking to it, but I think I'm opposed to any city administrators work plan because it would be intended to hurt poor people and help rich people. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public wishing to speak on this item? Is there anyone from council seeing none? This item moves on. Next item number four, resolution approving the plans, specifications, form of contract, and estimate of cost for the skate park improvement project.

Resolution approving a five year contract extension for printer maintenance services with managed Solutions group of Dubuque, Iowa. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Is there anyone from council seeing none? This item moves on. Next item number six, a resolution approving a one year agreement with the Humane Society of Scott County, Iowa for animal Protection and shelter services. Prior to asking to hear from the public, I would take a point of privilege to ask someone from staff to please come up and give an explanation of the factual background of what took place and what led us to today. Perfect. Thank you, Alderwoman Newton, for the opportunity to present here where we've been and where we are. So before you on the screen, it's just an overview of the last three approved contracts between the city of Davenport and the Humane Society of Scott county. We are longstanding partners for these services and I will draw your attention to the bottom so the most recent longer term contract that was approved was set for July 1 of 22 through June 30 of 25. That contract included a base fee of $391,000, which was set to increase by 3% thereafter for the future years of that term. Some other contract terms that were included in that particular contract was continuing to provide a vehicle for the society's use. Also the provision of fuel from the city's fuel islands, and then a $50,000 capital contribution, along with an agreement to purchase some radios and maintain those for dispatching. So that brings us to this past August. So, August of 23, we received a cancellation notice from the Humane society, which was set to be effective this past February. The request to continue services was around 1.4 million annually, and given that the general fund is really the primary funding source to fund this contract, we began due diligence in exploring alternatives, given that the amount was nearly a million dollars over what the current contract was, and that is something that's a standard practice for us when we start to see contracts come in high. So moving forward last fall, we continued to evaluate what some of those alternatives could be. We explored an internal civilian model that would have been housed through the police department, and we could have achieved a few different economies of scale with this. Again, these were just the three primary benefits, but one being that we could diversify the funding source and utilize some other resources that we have. We have an existing management structure and we're already paying the overhead for things like HR finance it, and then lastly the ability to consolidate call data with our police department and neighborhood services departments and some of the job duties of staff that we already had.

We have an existing management structure and we're already paying the overhead for things like HR finance it, and then lastly the ability to consolidate call data with our police department and neighborhood services departments and some of the job duties of staff that we already had. That brought us, after evaluating all of that in the financial model that was associated to making a recommendation to the council in early January to adopt this internal model. Concurrently, we had brought forward an amendment to at least get us through the current fiscal year so that services could be provided through June 30, and that was approved in the amount of 250,000. We determined, the council determined that the desire was to return to the negotiating table with the humane society in attempt to reach an agreement which would be in the best interest of everyone involved if we could reach terms that were agreeable. So there was a negotiating committee that was formed that included council members and staff members in negotiations with the humane society resumed. So an update. Pleased to present a tentative agreement to you tonight that has been reached with the humane society. I want to thank them for all of the dialogue and the exchange of proposals over the last couple of weeks as we work to get this language just right. So the contract that is before you for consideration next Wednesday night is an agreement term beginning July 1 of this year through June 30 of 25 would increase the base contribution, the fee, to 800,000. The city would contribute an additional 50,000 towards the hiring of a fundraising consultant to help us work towards a more sustainable model over time. We will relinquish the non voting board seat that was included in the last contract. That was a new ad. So again, we're saying we will relinquish that some other terms that remain in this contract are continued use of the vehicle and the provision of fuel. We'll also continue to provide those radios and any associated maintenance, and we'll agree to conduct training for the humane society's officers and staff that are involved in these services. And lastly, and I think the thing that I know we're all looking forward to is the establishment of a task force. So the agreement, again, that's before you, establishes a joint task force between the humane society in the city and possibly some of our other governmental partners to really evaluate how we can produce a sustainable, more longer term contract that delivers these important services to our residents. And we have agreed to contribute 50% of the required staff time towards any of these projects. I would anticipate likely some ordinance updates coming out of this group and possibly some programmatic changes. So again, we at the staff level are looking forward to collaborating with you as the council, the humane Society staff and their board to hopefully achieve that sustainable business model moving forward with an agreement date. I believe here for next steps. We've set next February of 25 as our benchmark date to evaluate where we're at in terms of that more longer term agreement. So just quickly, next steps. You have this updated agreement before you tonight. The task force will conduct its first meeting before mid April. We will develop a work plan as a task force and start assigning out roles and responsibilities and who is going to take what pieces of this large project that is before us. We'll continue to meet monthly as a task force and then again with the ultimate goal to bring back a more long term contract to you by February of next year. Do we know who's on the task force? Mayor, I would defer to you. That's your appointment. I asked one woman, Berkhalter, if she would be the consul representative. She graciously accepted. Thank you, mayor. Thank you for that. Is there someone from the Humane society here? I'd like to hear from you before hearing from the general public. Thank you. Good evening, council. My name is Erica Gunn. I'm the executive director of the Humane Society. Thank you, Mallory, for the very nice overview. You made my speech a lot shorter. The Humane Society wants to thank the council members and staff members who met with us recently to help us move this forward in our contract negotiations and the many citizens who have expressed their support for our mission and continuance of the contract as long term partners. The Humane Society and the city were able to come to that one year agreement, and that contract would last from July of 2024 this year through June 2025 with that payment of 800,000. We know that we have come to you guys with that amount of 1.3 million. That is the cost of what it takes to employ five animal protection officers, two dispatchers. We provide seven day a week coverage, eight to five and eight to seven, depending on if it's a weekday or weekend. We also provide 24/7 on call service after hours, and then we also pay for enough staff, food, medication, the building utilities, repairs, all of that for 3000 plus animals a year inside that shelter. From the city of Davenport, we recognize the effort that the city has put into this moving forward because we know that that is a big ask, and you guys have made a 100% increase to the contract, ", "answer_v2": "[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Humane Society\",\n    \"positives\": [\n      \"The council and the Humane Society reached a tentative agreement for a new contract.\",\n      \"The city will contribute an additional $50,000 towards hiring a fundraising consultant for a sustainable model.\",\n      \"Provision of vehicles, fuel, radios, and maintenance will continue.\",\n      \"The city will conduct training for the Humane Society's officers and staff.\",\n      \"Establishment of a joint task force between the Humane Society and the city to evaluate sustainable services.\",\n      \"The Humane Society provides 24/7 on-call service and cares for over 3000 animals annually.\"\n    ],\n    \"negatives\": [\n      \"The new contract cost is significantly high at $800,000, which is an increase from prior contracts.\",\n      \"Previously requested amount was 1.3 million, indicating substantial operational costs.\"\n    ],\n    \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n    \"comment\": \"While there are positive indicators of collaboration and support from the city, the substantial increase in contract costs raises concerns.

It's a really great step in the right direction. Many people probably ask why we agree to a significantly lower amount than we originally came to the table with. We want to be very transparent at that decision. So the humane society is very passionate about our mission. Of course, we've been around for a long time, and we understand that if we stop providing that service is detrimental to animal welfare and our mission here in the community based on that, and the fact that this agreement includes the required creation of that task force, which will be comprised of both the Humane Society representatives, a board member to two members of city staff and city council, possibly other cities or county representatives and the Humane Society of the United States would like to be involved as well. We are agreeing to cover services at that lower rate for this additional year. The goal of the task force is to evaluate those possible ordinance or program changes and evaluate enforced licensing programs. We believe that with improvements in ordinances and enforcements, we can bridge this gap in payment and cost between that 800,000 and that 1.3 that we were asking for, so that we can find a sustainable solution for all of us as continued partners, the active participation of city staff, city council and our staff and board are really the key to this task force. I want to thank you guys for your time tonight, your time in the past, and we're really looking forward to getting started if this is approved. Thank you. And thank you to you and the Humane Society on behalf of the council for working with the city and coming to the table in good faith to attempt to negotiate. Now, I'd like to hear from the public. If there's anyone here from the public that would like to comment, please step forward. State your name, address or award, please. Mary Johansson, first award. And I want to thank the council and the mayor and the interim city administrator to make an effort to make this work. I was here when everybody was invited to say their piece about the need, and I'm glad that we all came to the point where we understand that it's important that these animals are taken care of because humans are failing. And the ordinances I hope that you guys can create can maybe help make these citizens a little bit more responsible for their care. But I'm very happy when I heard that this was happening so good on all of you. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else from the public? Judith Lee, second word. I just want to also thank council for tabling this to allow it to be carried through more negotiations, looking at the details of what needed to be done. And I think you folks have done a really good job, you and the humane Society. And I just wanted to thank you for what you've done here. And I think it's going to move forward well. And I think you will be an excellent thank you. Is there anyone else from the public? Now I turn to the council. Is there anyone from council wishing to speak on this item? Seeing none, this item would pass or moved forward. Lastly, item number seven was a motion directing the city administrator and related staff to implement an internal animal service unit and negotiate any related contracts or agreement. I'll take a point of privilege to remind the public that this matter had been tabled on more than one occasion. It is the staff recommendation and mine that this motion be deleted. So I would move to delete this motion. Do I have a second here? In a second. Do we need roll call? Oh, okay. All in favor, say aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Just quickly, to mention on the agenda the items that are purchases of 10,000 to 50,000. And now I would move to Vice chair Alderwoman lynch and ask her to please set the agenda. Thank you. Chair. I make a motion to place items one through eleven on the consent agenda. One through six on the consent agenda. All in favor or. I got a second. 2nd. All in favor, say aye. Thank you. And that concludes the finance agenda. I yield the floor back to you, Mayor Matson. Thank you. Alderwoman Newton and Alderwoman lynch, the next area, are there any other ordinances, resolutions or motions? There are not. And the next area is other reports of city officials. The next. Will an alderman please move to go to executives? You can sit or stand, I guess. No public comment tonight. Next, will an alderman move to go into executive. Thank you, miss, please. Yes. A motion has been moved and seconded. Before I call Mister corrupt roll, I just want to let everybody know that council will adjourn the meeting after the executive session will not return to council chambers.

Okay, before I ask for approval of the city council meeting minutes for April 10, my understanding there's a correction that needs to be made to the minutes, so I'll ask deputy clerk mister Krupp to explain. Mister krupp, please. Thank you, your honor. The April 10 council meeting minutes currently state that alderman Grip and Alderwoman McGinnis moved and seconded to delete discussion agenda item number four. I reviewed my notes and then watched the video, and alderman grip and alderwoman McInnes moved and seconded the initial resolution. And alderman kelly and alderman Berkholder actually moved to delete the item. So the minutes need to be corrected to accurately reflect that. I provided all of you a copy of how the minutes look now and how they will look when they're corrected. So thank you to Oliver and Kelly for bringing that to my attention. And thank you all for the opportunity to explain. Back to you, your honor. Thank you. Mister Krupp, is there a motion to correct the city council minute meetings for April 10, 2024? So moved. Second motion? Second to correct. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Very good. They're corrected. Will an alderman please move approval of the city council meeting minutes for April 1024 as corrected? We did that. Is there a city administrator update, Miss Merritt? Thank you, your honor. Yes. Tonight's administrator update will be provided by Parks and Recreation director Dyson, who will provide you with an update on summer pool operations. And before you do that, mister, I apologize. We did not actually move the. We'd moved the correction, but we didn't move the motion. So we'll now move approval of the city council minutes for April 10. So moved. Motion and second. All in favor? Aye. Very good with the correction now, Mister Dyson. Thank you, mayor on council. Chad Dyson, parks and recreation director. I have the honor tonight to actually update you on our pool staffing for this year. As you're aware, the past several years heading out of the pandemic, we have struggled to acquire enough lifeguards and staff to operate the pools in full capacity. I'm happy to report at this time we will be operating at pre pandemic levels. We've successfully hired 65 lifeguards, over a total of 81 aquatic staff in total for both Annie Witt and fudgeberry pools. So they will open June 2 and operate at pre pandemic levels seven days a week. So I also want to take a moment to recognize our hr department. They were very instrumental in helping us recruit and get to our staffing levels that we need. So want to give them a quick shout out as well. So thank you. Thank you very much. Great news. Okay, well, now to move approval of the report of the committee of the whole for April 17 2nd. Okay. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Very good. We have two appointments, three proclamations.

National Small Business Week, compost awareness week, and Arbor Day. The first one is national small business Week, April 28 to May 4. And that'll be read by Alderman Reinerts. Alderman Reinerts, please. Thank you. National Small Business Week. Whereas, America's spirit of innovation thrives to unwavering dedication of our small businesses, who tackle our nation's challenges with fresh ideas and create opportunities for families and workers to flourish, and whereas, from the corner store that define our neighborhoods, to the cutting edge startups driving progress, small businesses are the very foundation of our economic strength and the embodiment of the american dream. And wHereas, supporting these businesses in Davenport fosters job creation and safeguards the unique character of the community and wHEReas, because over 33 million small businesses across the nation employ over half of all American workers, it is crucial to support our entrepreneurs and foster economic growth and wHEReAs, the president of the United States has proclaimed National Small Business Week each year since 1963, highlighting the valuable programs and services offered by the US Small Business Administration and other government agencies to empower entrepreneurs, and wheReas, Davenport proudly joins a national effort committed to assisting our local small business in the endeavors of expanding their options, operations, creating jobs, and ensuring the continued vibrancy of our community. Therefore, we, Mayor Matson and the City Council of Davenport, Iowa, do hereby proclaim April 28 through May 4, 2024, as National Small Business Week in Davenport urged the residents of our community and communities across the country to support small businesses and merchants during National Small Business Week and throughout the year dated this 24th day of April, 2024. Mayor Matson, mayor of Davenport, Brian Krupp, deputy city clerk, is Nate Soboca from Front street. Make a motion. All in favor? Okay, now I guess I can do this. Nate Samoca, check it out to you. No. From front street brewery. You're a handsome man, so you're better without the hat. I appreciate you want to say something first? Up to you. Thank you all very much, sirs. Much appreciated for everything you guys do. Here you go. Congratulations. Thank you very much. I'll get it right yet. Thank you. Next is compost awareness week, read by alderwoman mcGinnis. Alderman McGinnis, please. Thank you, your honor. I think we all know what a great compost facility that Davenport has, and so I'm honored to read this in honor of compost council or composting week. So here we go. Whereas the composting council research and Education foundation, along with other countries, has declared the first full week of May as the annual international Compost awareness Week, and whereas recognizing the benefits and values of composting, the city of Davenport demonstrated vision, stewardship and leadership by constructing and making operational the Davenport compost facility in 1995 and whereas, leaves, grass, tree trimmings and wastewater biosolids account for nearly 30% of our community's waste stream, and whereas converting organic waste into a beneficial product known as compost, the city can extend the life of our local landfill and provide access to nutrient rich, 100% natural soil amendment products to our community. And whereas, composting is a way of returning organic resources to the soil, reducing erosion and non point source water pollution, conserving water, reducing climate impacts by improving sequestration of carbon in soils and is a proven method of decreasing erosion and dependence on chemical fertilizers. And whereas, the city of Davenport celebrates the Davenport compost facility, soil conservation stewards, property owners, landscapers, farmers, recyclers, public workers, composters, gardeners and plant growers everywhere for their efforts to improve local soils and waterways through the use of compost and compost products. And now, therefore, we, Mayor Mike Matson and the city council of Davenport, Iowa, do hereby proclaim May 5 through May 11, 2024, as Compost Awareness Week in Davenport and recognize the contributions the city and residents make daily to support a sustainable community. Dated this 24th day of April 2024, I move the proclamation. All in favor? Opposed? So I will have meeting me at the podium, Nicole Gleeson, public works director and the most popular man in Davenport, Robert Bartleson, compost supervisor. Please meet me at the podium. Congratulations. Thank you for everything you do. One, two, three. If you'd like to say something, just thank you for very much for this recognition. Just for awareness.

Sterling Morton passed proposal or proposed a special day that would be set aside for planting of trees, and whereas trees can reduce the erosion and precious topsoil by wind and water, cut heating and cooling cost, moderate the temperature, clean the air, produce life giving oxygen, and provide habitat for wildfire and whereas, trees are renewable resources and give us paper wood in our homes, fuel for our fires and countless other wood products and whereas, trees in our city increase property values, enhance the economic vitality of business areas, and beautify our community and whereas, trees, wherever they are planted and a source of joy and spiritual renewal and wHereas, Davenport is observed each arbor day for 43 consecutive years by planting trees. And now, therefore, we, Mayor Mike Masson and the City of Council of Davenport, Iowa, do proclaim April 26, 2024 as Arbor Day in Davenport. And we encourage all citizens to celebrate Arbor Day and support efforts to protect our trees and woodlands and further encourage all citizens to plant trees and gladden the heart and promote all well being of this and future generations. Dated this 24th day of April, 2024. Can I have somebody make a motion to move this proclamation? Thank you. All in favor? Aye. Okay. Accepting this will be Nicole Gleeson from Public Works director and Wayne Johnson, arborist for the City of Davenport. I just want to take an opportunity. So recently, you're all very familiar with John Vance. He recently retired and Wayne has graciously stepped into that position. He had spent quite a bit of time as the lead, so I just wanted to take an opportunity to thank him for stepping in and introducing me to you. Thank you so much and I look forward to working with everybody here. Thank you. Thank you all. We have one presentation today, a great program, 2024 fire explorers recognition. And I will meet Lieutenant Solis at the podium for this recognition. All right, good evening. For over 20 years, the Davenport Fire Department has been involved with educating area youth on career path of firefighting. The Explorer program provides hands on education and information for interested youth ages 14 to 20 years old. Tonight, I have the privilege of introducing our 2024 explorers. These teens come from different backgrounds, schools and ages, but they share one common goal of learning about the DFD and how we operate. This year's topics have included extinguisher training, CPR skills and fire hose evolutions. Later this year, we'll be educated on hazardous material and participating in in a joint training with the Danport Police Department on our rescue task force. Mayor, if you would like to help me with recognizing our explorers. Our first year explorers are Hannah Griffin, Nicole Norton and Sam Ross. Our second year explorers are Brian Koopman, Gage musman and Cooper shook. Finally, I'd like to recognize our second year explorer and our high school intern at deport fire department. Chloe lovelace Doran. Okay, can you get all this? Very nice, lieutenant. Thank you for leading this. Okay, next, petitions and communications from alder folks. Anyone? Alderman McGinnis. Thank you, your honor. Just a couple of things. Tonight, I wanted to welcome back a trolley pub to the streets of Davenport. This was an enterprise that came on our streets. The issue was really that Iowa law doesn't, did not really make. These were not legal vehicles for Iowa streets. And there had been a request last summer to put in an ordinance, but we cannot put in an ordinance that violates state law, basically. So that operator closed. We had people come, come back and say, and there was instruction of, this is how you can do this. You have to have a street registered, licensed vehicle, basically. So a couple of people in the city went back, did the work, did the legwork through the fall, got the proper licensing for everything, and came back. And those are approved now. So they're back on our streets. And I want to thank them for their perseverance, working with the city to come up with vehicles that are safe and are licensed for the streets and are in accordance with state law. So you heard about that this week, and they were back.

So you heard about that this week, and they were back. The other thing I wanted to say is there's a little progress on the Frank L. Smart, the new school in the west end. There will be a meeting on May 23 for everyone to come to the school and see the new plans. The process which starts in planning and zoning for some changes that the school board is requesting of, starts in May. But there will be a meeting on May 23, and we'll be inviting people across the city. Frank L. Smart is the school for a very large part of the area south of Locust in the city. And so we know there'll be a lot of public interest. Wanted to give a chance for people to see the presentation the council was able to see at their management update meeting and learn a little bit more about the campus that's proposed. So that will be coming up, and we will be announcing that more widely in the coming weeks. So thank you, your honor. Thank you, Alderman McGinnis. Alderman Kelly, thank you so much. Let me start off with, when you know better, you do better, even though. Whatever. So this Thursday will be the fifth word. Alderman meeting at harvest time Baptist Church on the corner of Kirkwood and Grand. I don't know the address, but it's all over social media, and the city did send it out as well. And also a reminder of May 28 to keep the conversation going. About 334 Main street will be at third Baptist at 05:00 at night. It'll be a nice program that we're trying to put together so we can celebrate a celebration of those folks lives that were lost. And that's all I have. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Kelly, Alderman Newton. Thank you, mayor. I have two communications tonight. The first is just an update. The code of conduct committee is still working on that. A doodle poll went out recently at the request of Alderman Jovgen, and we're looking to have follow up meetings so that we can get something finalized to present to the council. The second is just to make the public aware that elder woman Brook Holder and I have been working with our interim administrator and our civil rights director at setting a special council meeting between the council and the commission as a good opportunity for the council to get to know the commission and learn more about the commission so that the council better understands the commission's needs now and in the future. Once the date is set, we'll make sure that the public is made aware. Obviously, that would be an open session meeting that the public can and would be encouraged to attend. Thank you. Thank you, alderman Newt. Alderman Grip. Thank you, your honor. I just wanted to make mention that I don't have any new updates regarding the search for the city administrator pending the approval of tonight's professional services contract for the recruitment firm. Once that is approved, then we'll get started on the next steps and I'll have a new update for you next time. And then I also wanted to put an announcement out for the friends of Martin Luther King who are doing a grand opening celebration for the Martin Luther King park that is located at 501 Brady street, and that will be this Sunday, April 28, at 03:00 p.m. the weather is supposed to be beautiful. Everybody from the public is invited. That is over a decade in the making, and it will be great to cut the ribbon on that and welcome that new park into the city of Davenport. Thank you, your honor. Thank you. Anyone else? Alderman McKelley, you have something else? Yeah, just. I got an email saying that there may be a reschedule for weather. Just so you know, for the MLK. So be on the lookout that that may be rescheduled. So. I agree. So be prepared. They haven't decided. They're gonna make the decision, I think, tomorrow, right? Yeah. Good. Thank you for that. Anyone else? Very good. We'll move to the individual approval of items on the discussion agenda. We have one. It is a motion approving a beer and liquor license. Annual license, 11th street precinct 2108. East 11th street outdoor area license type c. The fire department recommends denial of the west outdoor service area. Is there any public with comment? Seeing none, we'll inaugural move consideration of the motion. Motion and a second. Any discussion from alder folks? I see Alderman job. Thanks, mister mayor. Just start off. I will be making a motion to table this with business owner being out of town. I'll be making a motion to table to the cycle of May 15 and 22nd. But as customary, we'll see if anybody else has some comments before doing so. I'll second that. He just let you know, see if anybody else is anything. Okay, having seen that, does anybody else have any other comments before I go back to Alderman Jobshin for the motion? Reiners, do you have a comment, can I ask before we go down into heaven? So he hasn't made the motion yet. So this is discussion? Yep. Okay, so yeah, you're gonna. Okay, I'll go back to Alderman job. Therefore, I make a motion to table this item to the May 15 and 22nd council cycle. Is there a second? 2nd? Alderman Barkov. Okay, motion a second to table.

Mister Krupp, please call the roll for tabling tilta cycling. Kelly? Yeah. Grip. Yes. Brook holder? Yes. Ardon? No. McGuinness? No. Reinart? Yes. Lynch? Abstain. T. Dunn. Yes. Job. Yes. Ann Newton. Yes. Seven yeses, two nos and one abstention, your honor. Very good. The motion is tabled to the respective date. Okay, next area is a motion for approval of all items on the consent agenda. Move the consent agenda. Second motion. Second. Brian, please call the roll for all items on consent. Berkholder. Yes, Mister Dunn, do you have something for on an item? Okay, I apologize. So, Mister Krupp, please hold. Do you want to take something off of consent? I would please. I'd like to take item number eleven consent agenda to make an amendment motion. And then you put it back on? Yep. If memory serves me correct, the city has always had board seat representation associated with economic development before with the Quad City first and then on the chamber board. It's my understanding that the chamber board removed the public sector representation. Therefore, since we no longer have representation, I move to amend that the payment for the Quad city chamber be withheld until council has had a work session to understand how things have changed and how our funds will be will benefit the community. After the work session, the council can make a decision and authorize the expenditures. Okay, so that's a motion for that individual, number eleven, correct? Okay, there's a second. All right. Is there discussion on that motion, alderman Grimm? Just a point of clarification. Are we allowed to take something off consent agenda and then modify it? Brian? Yes, sir. Okay. Thank you. Because historically, once it's voted on for consent, it was a unanimous. It was a majority decision, and it was a, in this case, unanimous decision. So you can take it off to discuss, but not to change the voting. Just to clarify that. Are you saying we're okay? Okay, so historically we. When everything. Something's voted on consent, that's the vote. You can take it off to make a discussion, but to change the vote on something that's been put on consent doesn't happen. Are you saying that's okay? Shouldn't adhere to prior protocols. Okay, so then we shouldn't vote. It's on consent. You can make your comment and make your request to something that was on consent. So we need to have clarification. So I just want to be clear that I made this comment last week, and I just thought instead of me asking personally, that this would be a council decision instead of my decision. So I guess I stand where I stand. And if we don't. If it is what it is. So. So I just need to know if it's okay to continue. The comment was made last week. The action should have occurred last week. So we're where we should be. And you're correct. Okay. There's only a vote on the amendment. There's a motion on the floor. So. And I think I still have the floor because I was at. I was asking the question. And really all I'm doing is clarifying the rules here, which our practice as a council has been that once something is on the consent agenda, you can't take it off of the consent agenda to amend it or to vote on it. It has to stay on the consent agenda. That's all. I am not disagreeing with what Alderman Dunn is saying. I want to have that conversation, but I just want to make sure that we're following our own rules. And so I was asking legal counsel to make sure that we are following our rules. Thank you. And those rules should be followed unless they're overruled by a majority vote of the council. Okay? So I'm going to stick with the rule. Unless someone would like to overrule that. I would like to know what rules we're referring to because I thought we weren't following any rules. Okay, so I see Alderman Dunn. Thank you. Again, I just want to be clear. Previous councils, when one alderman brought something up, if there was nobody that disagreed or made a comment, that's usually what we did. Direct staff took that as a recommendation. I just want to make sure that's clear, that that's a recommendation we're taking. I don't want, I don't want people to think that one alderman's making this decision. I guess that's my concern. Okay. Let me know when you're done. Alderman McGinnis, could I make a friendly request that we put have the discussion? But I think the issue is not paying until we've had the meeting. So I think having the discussion with that and then that's. I think the not paying impacts the budget directly. And I think that's the question. Is that. Can you clarify any, Miss Merritt? Yes, I can clarify, actually, in light of the comments that were made around this item last week, I was able to meet with the chamber leadership staff yesterday to further discuss this. They are fully aware that we are in a position that we are requesting a formal board seat.

I just want to make sure that's clear, that that's a recommendation we're taking. I don't want, I don't want people to think that one alderman's making this decision. I guess that's my concern. Okay. Let me know when you're done. Alderman McGinnis, could I make a friendly request that we put have the discussion? But I think the issue is not paying until we've had the meeting. So I think having the discussion with that and then that's. I think the not paying impacts the budget directly. And I think that's the question. Is that. Can you clarify any, Miss Merritt? Yes, I can clarify, actually, in light of the comments that were made around this item last week, I was able to meet with the chamber leadership staff yesterday to further discuss this. They are fully aware that we are in a position that we are requesting a formal board seat. I received a correspondence this morning from Mister Tokar confirming that the city would have a voting board seat on the new economic development entity. So. And the city is actively working on the economic Development Advisory council, along with our other peer communities in our region, to establish what a new service contract would look like. And then that would come back to you for formal approval as the council. Thank you. I see. Alderman Jobson. Thanks, Mister mayor. Is the alderman who made the motion able to rescind that motion? That can always happen, yes. And the second would have to be rescinded. In light of that. I guess I will rescind it then. I will rescind my second. So that's been taken care of and I still see Alderman woman Newt. Thank you, mayor. I just, I mean, we keep talking about rules and I don't know what rules we're talking about because last I was informed, there are no council rules. So if there are rules, I would like a copy of such rules so that we're all on the same page. Because we keep going back and forth between rules or not. And just for clarity on this particular matter, I would not be taking a position. I would have to abstain because I am a member of the chamber and board. But my objections is to the procedure and the process. So either we have rules or we don't have rules. So. And I want a copy of them if in fact they exist. Thank you, Alderman Newton. But this issue is mute now because the person who made the motion, the second, have rescinded. So, Brian, please call the rule for consent. Berkholder. Yes. T. Dunn. Yes. Mcginnis. Yes. Lynch. Yes. Ardon? Yes. Reinhardts? Yes. Jobgen? Yes. Newton. Yes. Kelly. Yes. Ann. Grip. Yes. Ten yeses, your honor. Very good. Consents approved. The next area is other ordinances, resolutions, motions. We have one request, but first we need a motion to suspend the rules to add the vote to add and vote on the item. Is there a motion to suspend? Second motion and a second to suspend Brian, knowing that we need eight to suspend Brian, please call the roll. Job. Yes. Ardun? Yes. Berkholder. Yes. Grip. Yes. T. Dunn. Yes. Kelly. No. Lynch. Yes. Newton. Yes. Reinards. Yes. And mcGuinness. Yes. Nine yeses and one no, your honor. Very good. The motion. I'm sorry, the rules are suspended. So we have one item, a resolution approving the interim city administrators employment agreement. Is there any public with comment? And please remember what I said at the beginning. Thank you. Gary ekman. I live in alderman kelly's ward. I want to speak in opposition to this. I understand the new people on the council want continuity or they want someone in a position to move forward. I think that a whole lot of people in the city of Davenport want some serious changes and we don't want to wait nine months. You know, we, a lot of people blame the city government in large part for the collapse of 324 Maine. It was mentioned recently that the former city administrator testified under oath. I think it was about who her close personal friends in the city were. And my position is anyone named by the former city administrator as being her close personal friends should not be promoted to anything. I think this is a horrendous mistake, even if only going on appearances sake. Sometimes they say, you know, the appearance of a conflict of interest. I praise an alder woman who recently abstained from a vote. Sometimes you should abstain. Sometimes an appearance of a conflict is enough that you shouldn't promote someone. We already have this woman supervising and her husband. I wanted to look up how much money a month the two of them were making on the city. I did not have time, but she was, like I say, listed under oath as a close personal friend. And I personally want to know how. I'm not sure when she stopped being the personnel director and moved up, but I would like to know how so many close personal friends of the city administrator became high up ranking city officials. We're supposed to have a hiring department that is supposed to look for the most qualified individual. And I find it unbelievable that the head of the neighborhood department and the assistant administrators and the human resources department all listed as close personal friends would all also be the most qualified individual. At the same time, I just find it beyond comprehension and beyond belief. My own personal opinion is anyone involved in the ouster of alderman Cornet should not be promoted. And I may very well agree more on more votes with Alderman Cornet's replacement isn't a question of personalities or who's better or who's worse. It's a question of procedurally, you know, what would qualify as actions that would demand that someone be removed immediately. And now I know when I mention the word sweetie, which was used in this hearing, that there were other things besides just the word sweetie being used. But the fact that the word sweetie was made a big deal about. I remember, I think it was the human resources director, although maybe it was. I didn't watch the whole thing, but a friend of mine showed me part of it.

I didn't watch the whole thing, but a friend of mine showed me part of it. Someone jumped up and said, regarding the use of the word sweetie, that any Davenport, Iowa City employee who used the word sweetie to another Davenport city, Iowa, employee would be terminated for cause immediately. Because this isn't Tinder. I've reported in writing to multiple people, racist language by city staff who are still on the payroll, including very high ranking, very high paid positions. I don't understand how you can oust an alderman. And they were the ones who mentioned the word sweetie. I'm not the one who mentioned it. It was very prominent in his ouster. And again, that's not to say that his replacement isn't better. They should have had a fair election to determine who represented that seat. This person was also the personnel director. I've gotten in trouble before when I referred to the public employees seating section as the white supremacist, the whites only seating section. It's not. It's the employee seating section. But in my opinion, to promote someone who was ever a personnel director in the city of Davenport since 1980 on if you look over at the employees seating section and any individual over there may be the most wonderful person in the entire world, but in a city that is 50% white and 50% everybody else, to have a 100% whites appearing only seating section for the public employees, the highest paid, most influential people, is outrageous. And no one who has been personnel director in the city of Davenport since 1980 should have another government job the rest of their life, much less be promoted. Thank you. Next, please. The former president of the United States is on trial right now in New York for hiding a payoff until after the election. A lot of people think the former president is on trial for the $130,000 payoff. Nope. It's for the coverup of the payoff until after the election. That is illegal. It's exactly the same thing that we have right here in River City. It's not the payoff of almost $2 million to three former city employees. It's the COVID up until after the election. Misses Merritt was intimately involved in covering up the payoffs until after the election. Misses Merritt was and still is the chief financial officer for the city. If you want to hide a payoff until after the election, you will need the cooperation of Misses Merritt. And misses Merritt fully cooperated with hiding the payoffs until after the election. I'm going to repeat that. Misses Merritt fully cooperated with hiding the payoffs until after the election. The state auditor of Iowa is now conducting a re audit of the city of Davenport. The state auditor is investigating not just these payoffs, but the COVID up until after the election. The state auditor has issued a subpoena to the city council. That's you guys. And the city of Davenport has responded by suing the state auditor to quash the subpoena. The state auditor is investigating Misses Merritt and her actions as chief financial officer. And now the city council is once again on the brink of giving misses Merritt a raise. No, no, no. Misses Merritt does not deserve a raise. Misses Merritt deserves to be fired immediately. You do not reward a city employee who engaged in illegal cover up. The state auditor will almost certainly make criminal referrals to the state attorney general. Let that sink in. Let that sink in. Quite probably, city employees and elected city officials will face criminal prosecution because of covering up the payoffs until after the election. That is a crime. And you want to give Misses Merritt a race? No. Absolutely not. Do the right thing. If nothing else, do it to save your own hides. Do the right thing. No raise for misses Merritt. I got to say, this is what I call my Willy Wonka speech. I'm sitting here, I've done this before and before, and I keep saying to you guys, no, stop. Please, stop. And you don't listen. And the words of Ed Tibbets, you just keep digging a deeper hole. Stop. Thank you. Next, please. Hi. Good evening, Rosa. Quad cities.

I appreciate very much what doctor Sidron said. And I agree. That's what we've been watching for quite a while. As I said before, the city has had six months to take care of this issue. Last October, if not earlier. And you haven't done it then. And now you folks here are being forced into a very difficult position. I appreciate that many of most of the new aldermen have worked hard to create a new binding agreement. And stepped away from that MoU. It's not easy to turn this mess around even a little bit. I appreciate that. This agreement says that Miss Merritt cannot apply for the position. That's important. It'll help close an unfortunate chapter. One of my concerns is that this agreement is signed by the mayor and Miss Merritt. Once again, if you pass this, you are giving the mayor more authority than he has. It should be signed by city council. At a minimum, two thirds of city council. The mayor has no authority over either one of those positions. So the signature block itself is invalid in this. And you should not pass it without further consideration. If you pass it at all. I've got questions on the severance section seven. On the term section one, and on termination section six. Because they appear to conflict. I don't understand some of the involuntary separation things. And it says in six b. If council determines she has performed or not performed something so egregious. That she would be ousted by two thirds of a vote. But then it says she can be reinstated as CFO and assistant if you pass this. This section should also make clear. If she is removed by a two thirds vote of the council. Any lump sum payments in section seven do not apply. You've got contradictions in this thing that need to be addressed by a decent, knowledgeable, and unbiased attorney, which we are struggling with here as a city. I'm also uncomfortable with a level of familial association between her and her husband as it relates to management of the money in this city. It took almost two pages to explain how to make this work, and yet I believe it would be better if he were placed in his original position until she is no longer interim. If indeed she goes back to CFO, then you need conflict of interest agreements still between the two of them, because either way, you've got two people who are married to each other managing all the money in this city. And that is a concern to me. So not only am I concerned with what Doctor Sidron said, I'm concerned with the authority to sign this document. I'm concerned with the contents of this document, and I'm concerned that we are trying to rush something through when other entities, as well as some of you, put this city in a bind about this position and about the corporation council decision, and is now trying to force you into different ways to fix it without still fixing some of the problems. The mayor doesn't have the authority to sign this. Only you do. We've got conflicts regarding termination, and we've got conflicts of interest that aren't even addressed if she goes back to CFO. Two people control all the money in this city, and they are married to each other. I've got real concerns with this whole thing, and I request that you either don't sign it or certainly don't vote on it tonight and go back and fix it. Thank you. Thank you. Next, please. Diane Salmon, 8th board. We see that the $50,000 bonus issue has been dropped from the agenda, but hasn't really been dropped. Where do the amounts that are supposed to be retroactively paid and the amounts that is supposed to start being paid out and may come from who got to choose those amounts? It feels like this is all just a bunch of award games. Because if you retro her payback and you add in the $6,273 per month starting May 1 until the new city administrator is hired, she still ends up with well over $50,000. No one else receives that amount of pay. And some people have been working multiple positions for years. It also says under the new agreement, she would be paid $174,420, plus wage increases provided to other department heads and non bargaining employees. Does this mean we are going to see pay increases and raises for the civil rights director and her management staff. It says it's provided to other departments.

just a bunch of award games. Because if you retro her payback and you add in the $6,273 per month starting May 1 until the new city administrator is hired, she still ends up with well over $50,000. No one else receives that amount of pay. And some people have been working multiple positions for years. It also says under the new agreement, she would be paid $174,420, plus wage increases provided to other department heads and non bargaining employees. Does this mean we are going to see pay increases and raises for the civil rights director and her management staff. It says it's provided to other departments. So are you going to act like those positions are not as valuable as this one is? You can't pick and choose who you want to give massive amounts of money to and think that's okay. The mean girls club and the good old boys narrative needs to be stopped. And you need to stop spending the taxpayers money like it's monopoly money. That has no value, because it does. We have people going hungry in this city who are trying to decide whether to buy food, medication, or pay their bills in order to survive, and you're taking their hard earned money like it's nothing, just to make someone who's not financially struggling even richer. I think several of you have lost touch with reality, and you need to get that back before it's too late. You were elected by your constituents to listen to them, and many of you are not listening. We are calling on all of you to do the right thing and to not give out enormous amounts of money that our city cannot afford at this time. We have a younger generation that is going to be penalized by the decisions you make, or they're going to be flourishing because of the decisions you make. So please make the right decision. Thank you. Next, please. Mary Johansson, first ward. I think that there's a major conflict of interest here with the interim city administrator, who is going to be receiving more money. She apparently wrote a check for 1.6 million for the previous city administrator, and now she sits in that position, and now she's asking for more money for a representation of the city. I don't know, chief financial officer, what they get paid, but she was an assistant city administrator at the same time, so she's qualified to do the city administrator's job. So she's doing two jobs which nobody can do. Well, chief financial officer should be doing the job. Paying someone more money to perform the same job doesn't make any sense to me. If she's capable, she's capable. But this is still a conflict of interest. It shouldn't be going on. Another person should have stepped in. It doesn't seem to me that we even need a city administrator, but we do need a chief financial officer. But if it's true that her and her husband control the financial books of this city, that's also a conflict of interest, and it should be illegal. Someone should have lost their job or asked to be released. At that point, when both of them are holding that, either give her the chief financial officer job or put her husband in the city administrator job. But either way, it looks bad. And I'm not. I'm retired old woman. It looks bad. For this to be going on, y'all gotta be smart enough to say no and wait till this thing is cleared up. Cause it just isn't getting any better. It's just looking worse. Thank you. Thank you. Next, please. Sheryl Shagna. Third word. We did ask that you do this particular agreement and follow the process. From the sound of it, I cannot be positive that the process was followed correctly once again, in which case, I cannot ask you to approve it when you still did not follow the processes that are supposed to be done for this, if, in fact, that is what has happened. And I did have issues with the two or three page conflict of interest specific for one individual. When her and her husband have such elevated positions in this city, I can't imagine them not talking about work when they're not at work. And if decisions are being made based on the two of them and the time they spend together and what they think is best, then we are all in such a bad way. I don't know that that's happening. But as someone who was in a high position here like to say recently, people are predictable. So that conflict of interest pages was excessively long. That right there should be a red flag, even for the council, when you have to spend that much time writing out potential conflicts of interest, of having a husband and wife in such high positions in this city, and what happens in the decisions that are made. And maybe you all should recognize those red flags, too. And it isn't easy to replace a person in the situation you are in. I recognize that. But at the same time, is it best to keep moving forward just because it is perceived to be easier than doing the right thing? I wish to God the easy thing and the right thing was always the same thing, but quite often, it is not. The city, as a council, needs to focus on for a change, doing the right thing for the people. Not for individuals, for the majority. That might be a new concept for some of you. The majority. If only four or five people get up here and talk, it doesn't mean that 50 didn't want to get up and talk, but only five are able to stand up here in front of you and talk.

When I was involved with the lawsuit with the city, all right, I was told, I was told that my work had no value. I was told that I had no merit. I was told I did what I did because I was simply. It was a hobby. I had nothing else to do is what I was told. So take any of you people or anybody here you know and tell them that, all right, I was told I had no value because I did not make any money. I didn't sell the product. Now to me, that is a gross failure of my rights and understanding that I'm part of the city, okay? It goes to what I think is a major mindset problem in the city. I think that needs to be changed. Everybody's right, you know, if the right thing was done instead of the financially correct things, we're not a business. What we do is not all based on profit and loss and should not be looked at that way. And if decisions had been made, that was 12, 13, 14 years ago, if decisions would have been made on doing the right things, doing what should have been done, doing something with everybody in mind, you wouldn't have the problems you have. A lot of them would be gone or at least easier to remedy. I completely agree with everything being said here. It's a core problem. It needs to change. It needs to change with those people. It needs to change with you people. You have to listen to everybody. You really do. It's tough. I've said this earlier, you've got a tough job, but you've got to listen to everybody. And not everything we do is based on dollars and cents. It has got to be based on right and wrong. Thank you. Anyone else? Okay, will an alderman please move the resolution motion? And second, any discussion from alder folks? See. Okay, is there alderman new. Thank you, mayor. A few comments, because I do want to address some of the things said by the public because it is important. First of all, the council as a whole discussed what would be the right thing to do. If she is performing a job that pays a certain amount, she should get paid for that amount. During that period of time, I was against a bonus. There were several on council against a bonus. But she did perform a job from November to this date and will be continuing to perform a job, no one's going to take a job. And you know, if a manager at your work quits and then you have to do that job, you're going to be expected to pay what that position pays. Now, I've had a lot of questions and comments in the last week or so, so I wanted to address some of those so that there's clarity. One thing that kept coming up is that we pay the city of Davenport pays too much for an administrator. That is not exactly true. When you look at what other cities are paying other cities in the state of Iowa and compare the cities by the population of that city, Davenport's kind of in the median. I think part of the perception and where that comes from is that when Davenport reports the wages, they include the entire benefit package. So insurance and all those other benefits which inflates that number. But if we were going to compare apples to apples, we would be looking at her actual salary or the salary of an administrator and comparing that salary to the salary of an administrator in other cities such as Cedar Rapids, Des Moines, Iowa City. And then you would see that it's not true that Davenport is too high. It's actually kind of in the median. I've heard about wanting to protect tax dollars and we don't have money growing on trees. Unfortunately. If we did, I'd let you know where they're at. But that doesn't work that way. And I think the council is trying to be fiscally responsible. We have to have an administrator in the position filling the role. That is absolutely important. And it is the fiscally responsible thing to do to continue allowing our current interim to serve in that capacity until we find a permanent one. Now, I completely agree with the public and I've made that clear on more than one occasion. We need a fresh pair of eyes. I mean, we really do need someone from the outside to move our city forward. Anyone who's paid any bit of close attention knows that we have issues in Davenport and we're trying to work through those issues. And as I've said to the public on multiple occasions, we have to work together. I mean, it's not perfect. It's not going to happen overnight. And we're trying to. Every baby steps, we're trying to as a council, we did listen. The council listened to the public saying, hey, this should have been something discussed by the entire council. And that is exactly what we did in trying to arrive at an agreement that will get us to hopefully September 1, having a permanent administrator for the city of Davenport in terms of the conflict of interest. I agree. That's an issue. I think she recognizes the same, which is why she's not applying for the position, and she has made that clear. And that's actually in writing. So it's crystal clear to the, the public, and that's why that's a public document.

Let me get the name right. The West Creek. West Silver Creek, second edition, was approved by council. That was the two lot subdivision out on Wisconsin. Calvin Bolkama's request. That has been approved. And then the Stoltenberg rezoning. So rez 230 six. That's the land at Slopertown in Hillendale that was also approved. It's now officially industrial land. Thank you, Laura.

Nothing at this time. Thank you. There is no zoning activity. We have one subdivision activity, Commissioner Tallman. Thank you, mister. Thank you, mister chairman. It is case f 240 three. Request of five CL Illinois, LLC for a final plat of Nord AV, second edition. The Tulat subdivision is located at 1500 West 76th street on 19.3 acres. Staff recommends the plan Zoning Commission accept the listed findings and forward case f 240 three to the city council with a recommendation for approval, subject to the listed seven conditions in ISO movement. Second, case number f 240 three has been moved and seconded for discussion. Matt. Thank you. So, the subject property, just over 19 acres in area, located at the northeast corner of Division street and 76th street. So just to the north is Hawkeye Motors and then the interstate. And then to the east is ups and prime construction sites, zoned I one, which is a light industrial district that's consistent with the corridor of 76th street and our future. Land use map shows this property as industry as well. So the purpose of this final plat is to subdivide the parcel into two lots. So separating out the two buildings along Division street from the one warehouse building along 76th street. So create a 15 acre lot, roughly. And then the second lot would be just over four acres. Both lots would share the driveway that's existing along 76th street. So city staff is requesting that a cross access easement be in place to enable access to both sites. And then this shows the final plat as submitted. So staff are recommending conditions to vacate easements on the property that are no longer in use. Stormwater detention is on the eastern portion of the site. That's okay. Is on the eastern portion of the site. And then there's affiliated. There's a private sewer line for Hawkeye Motors that does extend through the site that will require an easement. So with that, city staff is recommending the commission approve the final plat as submitted, subject to the following findings and conditions. So findings that the platform forms with the comprehensive plan prepares the area for future development and sale of the property. And the plat, with conditions, is consistent with the city subdivision code. So seven conditions are proposed. So that would be to vacate existing utility easements that are no longer in use. Provide that access easement along the driveway on 76th street. Provide a continuous sanitary sewer easement through the south lot line of proposed lots one and two. Provide a private sanitary sewer easement for the line extending to Hawkeye Motor works at that northeast corner of the lot, and then the existing stormwater detention easement area shall also be depicted on the platform. Thank you, Matt. Commissioners, any questions? Commissioner Mainas. Thank you. I'm just wondering if any additional development or construction is expected on the property. Nothing at this time, but it would be possible for more for expansion of the existing uses. Is that right? In particular for lot one? There would be. Okay. Just curious if something was planned now. Thank you. Any additional questions at this time? Would the petitioner's representative have anything you'd like to say? Do we have any questions of the petitioner's representatives? Commissioner Darrington? I do have a question. Are they both owned by the same person? They are. They will be. So what is the plan for having two lots? Yeah, lot two is a separate facility from the main building. We've had that release right now, and we're just positioning that for in case we want to sell it. Ah, I see we're using both facilities.

Welcome to the April. What's today's date? 25. Hands right over top of the five. I can't read it. Welcome to April 25 meeting of the City of Davenport Zoning Board of Adjustment. The zoning board of Adjustment holds public hearings to consider strict application of zoning ordinances for hardship variances, special uses, and appeals. I'm Dan Darlin, chairman of the Danforward Zoning Board of Adjustment. Members present today, from your left to right, are Mike Galliart, Bridget Boyd Carlson, myself, and Jeff Blumker. Staff present today are Laura Berkeley and Scott copes. If you have a mobile device, we ask that you turn it off so it doesn't interfere with the room's electronics. As we conduct our business, we expect that everyone here will conduct themselves in a respectful, courteous, and civil manner. And will speak only after being recognized by the chair. The only exception to this standard is that the staff is expected to interject when necessary to ensure we are properly conducting our business. If anyone wishes to speak on a particular agenda item, you will be provided an opportunity to do so. When recognized by me, please step to the podium, introduce yourself and provide your input. I'm gonna pause there for a second. It's important the microphone for the audience is right above the podium. So that's why at the podium and then don't walk around. Sometimes people like to walk up to the map to point. And so you gotta stay under the mic at the podium or won't pick you up. And this is all recorded by practice. Each person is only permitted one opportunity to speak. Exceptions to that practice is at my discretion. Of course, if a board member asks a question of anyone, they'll be permitted to speak to answer that question. They'll ask you to keep your response limited to that specific question. All right, do we have any corrections to the amendments from our last meeting and hearing? None. I'll ask for motion to approve. Motion to approve. Second. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Mike. All in favor? Aye. Opposed? Hearing, none. All right, our first order, business under new business, is request to table SU 240 three and HV 240 six to and Sid be set up for consideration at the next public zoning board hearing date, which is currently scheduled for May 9. I'll just accept a motion to table that agenda item. So moved. And second? 2nd. All right, all in favor? Aye. Aye. Opposed. All right, so new business number one is table. All right, so second item in new business is request HV HV 240 four of Lenny, Brooklyn, at 4511 Brickerhill Road. Bricker Hill Road. For hardship variants to build an accessory structure, specifically pool and deck in a front corner, side yard. Properties zoned r one and zoning district requires accessory structures to be in the side yard or rear yard. And that's code 17.09.030, point a, .5 point c. And this is in war 1. May I have the staff report, please? Sure. Laura Berkeley Development Neighborhood Services. So you have before you the house. And. And this is off of. This is facing south off of Ricker Hill. So again, the request specifically is to encroach into the front yard setback with an accessory structure. They are proposing a setback of 7ft off the property line. Subject property has frontage on all sides except to the west, so it's a triangular shaped lot. So here's, here's the lot. The black line represents the lot. That yellow area is the only place on their property where they could technically place an accessory structure. Due to the roads on their lot lines and the shape of their lot. This is their proposed space. So it's on that bottom left there. So you have the pool and a deck around that as part of that proposal. This is a street view off of bluegrass Court, so you would kind of see where it would be located in relationship to the street and to the house. So nine notifications were sent out. We did not receive any comments. So, regarding each of the approval standards, the first one, strict application of the ordinance, allows only a small accessory structure envelope, so approximately 15 by 35 for placement on the property to the west of the dwelling. The code section creates a tangible, practical difficulty for this lot. Standard one is metal. For item number two, physical and topographical conditions of the site. The physical conditions, road furniture along every facade of the house except the west elevation do limit the developability of the site.

The character of the area may be impacted by the proposed pool, as there are a few properties throughout the city with accessory structures located in the front yard. Accessory structures are not a guaranteed development right. So standard four does not appear to be met. So for our findings about application ordinance, creating a hardship has been met. Physical and topographical conditions do limit development. Unique circumstance is established. An essential character may not be established. Our recommendations. So staff standards one through three appear to be met for hardship approval. Standard four, central character does not appear to be met to be met. Staff technically cannot recommend approval of request hv 240 four. Okay, thank you. And then board for our discussion, where, you know, our, I guess, point that we're concerned is the location. So any of the other standards, fencing for pools and things like that are all they'd have to adhere to regardless. Right. So we're just. We're just talking about location. So, with that, are there any questions from the board member for staff? Yeah. Laura, could you go to the. Could you go to the aerial view, where it shows the location of the deck and the pool? Yes. The rest. So, taking everything out. Else out, those set. The setbacks are being met. Correct? According to what is shown. So, if bluegrass court was an alley instead of a street. Yes. The setbacks would be met. Okay, where is the front of the house? Is it. It faces Ricker Hill, so it would be on the top part of that up here. Okay, so this is technically the backyard. Yeah, but it's on another. It functions. Yes. Okay. Yeah, so, technically, it's a through lie in our code, but it kind of functions. It's fairly narrow, and it functions more like an alley, but technically, it is a street. So. So for the orientation of the home, it's the home's backyard. Correct. But it is facing a street. Correct. Like, for any property, it doesn't matter which direction the house faces. It matters how the code defines things. But in this case, the appearance of the house that faces Ricker Hill is what appears to be the front Dakota. Silly. Front corner, side yard. The property, because of the street. But functionally, the direction the house is facing, it's in the home's backyard. Yeah, I think we. I think we're clear on that. Any other questions? Laura, what is that green box to the right? That was an alternative location for the pool to go. So the pool could go there to the. To the. To the east side? Not. No, not technically. No. As it showed in this diagram, technically speaking, the only place in this property where any kind of accessory structure could go is in that yellow area. So, staff only allows one proposal to come forward, and so we told them to choose one spot, and so they chose. So, the east side of the house, just within the borders of the house, is a side yard, and the others are both a front or a front side yard because of the streets, the triangle shape of the property. The east side is also a front yard because of. It's a triangular lot, so that's why a lot of the standards are met, because this is all street frontage. So, technically speaking, this is all front yard. I thought that was west. Oh, yeah. I said yes. The yellow box is east of the house. That's a side yard. That's to the west. Mm hmm. Okay. It's on the south side. Okay. And the roads flipped as far as which road was south. Gotcha. Okay. Yep. Yep. So that lot falls off really hard. Don't see. There's no concern from the city's perspective in terms of. Of drainage. No utilities, nothing there. I mean, there's a lot going on on that lot, but no concerns with drainage. With pudding, if you were to put a pool or not, something that small. Okay. All right. Any other questions for staff? So the. So north is not up south is up in the picture, right. North is up north is up north. North. That's west. Okay. All right, now I'm straight, I think. Okay, excellent. Okay. If there's no more questions, we'll have the applicant please come to the podium and present your request. State your name. My name is Leann Birkland. The only thing I heard you say that proper fencing and stuff like that. So our plan with it is, you can see that we have a deck, existing deck there. We're going to take part of that, like, the side off of that, and continue onto it and then build it completely around the pool. It's going to have tall, tall sides on it for privacy. Also for safety, there's a set of stairs right there to the right of what we're looking at. We're going to have a locking gate at the top of those. Plus, we would also. There might be another set of stairs for down below that. We will also have a locking gate at as well. That's still up for debate, but it will all be completely secure. Okay.

I mean, other than that, you guys have pretty well covered it. We were looking at the other side, but, I mean, anybody that knows Ricker Hill, Ricker Hill is dangerous. I've lived on Ricker Hill at that location my whole life. I've seen people in guardrails in the front. I've seen people drive through my yard, and I just. My worst fear was somebody coming down in the wintertime and driving through my yard and just completely taking that pool out. So. And Bluegrass road is a dead end road. The only people that use that road are the people that live down at the end of the road. We have three small children in the area, and actually, the three small children that are in the area are my nieces and nephews. So, because my sister lives two houses up from me. So, I mean, I'm very, you know, very protective about my stuff and, you know, like, try to keep things nice and neat and, you know, keep my neighbors happy. I definitely don't like to, you know, make my neighbors mad. So other than that, I mean, that's really about it. All right. I appreciate that. Any questions from the board to the applicant? I had a question, but I think you answered it regarding why not place it on the east side of it of the house. But, yeah, my central air unit is over there, so I would. I couldn't just expand my deck out. I would have to come out a few feet away from there and then build on instead of just building on to the house. And like I said, the fact of people driving through the yard and stuff, I just didn't. I don't want to put a bunch of money into something that somebody's just going to drive through. So, Miss Birkland, this will be an above ground pool? Yes. Yes. How deep will it be? When I stood up to it at the store, it went to here on me. So five foot. Will the deck then be the same height as the deck you have on the back now or will it. So the deck that we have now, what we'll end up doing is we'll have stairs coming down off of it and then it'll be complete flooring around it. Obviously, we'll have to stay within limits on the one. On the one side because we're pretty close to the 7ft. But it'll be enough just to enclose it completely. Okay. Any other questions? All right, thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone in the audience that would like to speak in favor of the request? Is there anyone in the audience that would wish to speak opposed to the request? Applicant, do you have any final. Final comments? Okay. None. All right, board discussion. One more quick question for the petitioner. So you use that for parking? I see you actively use that for a parking area back? Yes. Yes, that's our driveway. You'll continue to use that for parking even when the pool's in place? Yeah. Cause it'll be more over here and then I don't know if you can. So in our neighbor's yard over here, there's like a culvert that runs underneath. I heard you guys talking about the drainage. There's a culvert that runs down into the creek that I could, you know, run a hose from. So there was no, just like, letting the water go everywhere. You know what I mean? Cause there's a creek down behind the house that's there's woods right there. And so a pool like that has to have. You obviously have some. Some form of drainage that comes off that pool. And that's your plan, is to run. Run that drain line into the culvert next to the. Would it be so west of the house, then? Yeah, it would be this way. I'm surprised you can't see it in that photo. You can see the very corner of it down there, and then that runs underneath the road and then straight down where there's already water. And that's. I guess the question for staff is that's the code as well. That's not a concern. So what I would say is that whatever, if the board chooses to approve this, we will ensure that it meets any additional codes. Additional codes. Right. So again, so we're discussing location, fencing, drainage, discharging water off your property, someone else's property. Those are different things. We're discussing location. Any questions? I guess maybe just some comments. It's a very unique situation, obviously, with three sides. That's considered a front yard, right? That is that bluegrass road is a dead end road. I think it's probably more useful as an alley rather than an actual road. So I don't know. It's very unique. And to me, three of the situations are being met, except for the final one. I guess I can see myself in favor of this. That's all I have, Mister chairman. Yeah. I think the same point where it meets maybe the intent of the rule, if not specifically, every piece of it. But I don't disagree. Bridget, I don't know if I missed this, but did you say there was no comments or letters or anything from neighbors or. Okay, no comments. No responses. Yeah. Jeff. Anything? So I see staff use the word, like, technically, that would give the appearance that, in general, you just don't see concerns with this. There's a technicality here that would derail, in your opinion. Legally, you've got to deny it, but everything else seems appropriate and in line. Yeah, I think from a character standpoint, there's just not that many pools in that neighborhood. Not that there couldn't be. There just currently isn't. So they're not denying it on that. They just can't recommend approval. So there's no further.

I would take a motion to approve hv 240 four. I'll make a motion to approve request hv 240 four as proposed. I'll second roll call vote, please. Blumker. Yes. Galliard. Yes. Boyd Carlson. Yes. Darling. Yes. So that's approved. Thank you. For your time. All right, our third agenda item tonight. Yeah, you're sorry, I need to stay, but you're free to go. Yeah, your request is approved. So. All right. So third agenda items is request hv 240, five of Christopher Hagan at 5520 Greenfield Court for hardship variants to construct an attached garage addition which will encroach approximately three and a half feet into the seven foot required side yard setback as required by table 17.04.1 for property zoned in three reals. And this is in ward eight. So may I have the staff report, please? Yep. So this photo is off of the greenfield court facing the house. So the proposed garage would be directly to the right over here. So once again, to summarize, the request is to encroach in the seven foot side yard. So it would be about halfway through. So if this would be approved, the building would be three and a half, approximately three and a half feet from the property line. And we have the table there. Oops, sorry, the table there for you. So r1.02 reals and three reals all have seven foot setback requirements in residential areas. This is the proposed site plan. In yellow would be the additional garage stall, that it would be 30 by twelve. And that green line is the current side yard setback. And then the red line here is the property line. And then in an aerial form for you, yellow line is the property boundaries. This black outline would be the footprint of the addition with the starred there for you. So in green is the notice area. 15 letters were sent to adjacent property owners and we have two comments received in favor of the request. So generally the comments are that they're in support of the garage and they're good neighbors. That was the first one. And this one, again, just to summarize it, they're good neighbors and there's medical reasons for the additional and for the sake of the record, these were emailed to the board ahead of time. Yep. So those are out there for you. And when we get into the approval standard. So the first one is the case for ordinance created hardship has not been demonstrated. So a two car garage exists on the property. A third stall is not necessary for the property to be reasonably used as a residential zone lot. Their third stall is not grounds for hardship. The request is a convenience to the petitioner. Item two, physical and topographical conditions of the site do not limit development. Physical or topographical hardships are not present as the dwelling and the two car garage exist without a hardship. A desire for a third parking stall is not grounds for a hardship variance. Item three, no demonstrable evidence exists establishing a unique circumstance. No evidence has been presented necessitating a hardship variance due to a unique circumstance of this property. Specifically the property, a dwelling and a two car garage have been built on this site without a hardship variance. Garages, especially a third stall, are not a right guaranteed by the zoning ordinance. Desire for a larger garage is not a unique circumstance. It is a convenience to the petitioner. And item four, protection of essential character. Adjacent or neighboring properties exceeding minimum side yard setbacks are not guaranteed to remain in the future. Neighboring owners have the right to build up to their minimum setbacks. Essential character may not be maintained. Future action of other property owners cannot be predicted or restrained through this hardship variance process. So the four standards and findings have not been met. Staff recommends denial or request as the approval standards have not been met. Thank you for the board. Are there any questions of staff regarding their report? Could you go back to the aerial again, please? I understand it hasn't been requested, but would a detached garage be allowed on the rear property? Yes. So they would be able to do either a detached garage, which would require a driveway to it, or it's my understanding through the second letter of support that received that it's not necessarily for vehicular purpose. So an accessory structure would be allowed as long as the overhead door or door on it would be 6ft or less in width. You could put it in the rear yard at that point. Sure. Thank you. I will say, though, that the property does. There is a grade change in the backyard for that. Yeah. Any other questions for staff? Okay. Do you have a job for an eye? So the neighbor, I guess that's to the north. I'm a little disoriented here. But there was no concern from the neighbor? No. They rode in support of it. Right? Yeah. Okay.

I understand it hasn't been requested, but would a detached garage be allowed on the rear property? Yes. So they would be able to do either a detached garage, which would require a driveway to it, or it's my understanding through the second letter of support that received that it's not necessarily for vehicular purpose. So an accessory structure would be allowed as long as the overhead door or door on it would be 6ft or less in width. You could put it in the rear yard at that point. Sure. Thank you. I will say, though, that the property does. There is a grade change in the backyard for that. Yeah. Any other questions for staff? Okay. Do you have a job for an eye? So the neighbor, I guess that's to the north. I'm a little disoriented here. But there was no concern from the neighbor? No. They rode in support of it. Right? Yeah. Okay. All right, applicant, can you please come to the podium and present your. Introduce yourself and present your request. Hello, my name is Chris Hagan. This is what we're hoping to do. I would ask that the panel consider it as more of a workshop or like an accessory structure is what I'm really after. But just with the way that the backyard kind of slopes down and drainage is a mess back there right now. It's soggy to walk back there because of all the rain. So, I mean, to me, the logical, the best place to put it would be right here. Because if you put it in the backyard, it's going to be inaccessible during the wet seasons and it's not feasible back there. To me, this makes the most sense to place it, and like it was alluded to in the application. After the birth of our son four years ago, my wife's allergies became way worse. She developed new allergies. So the original plan, the workshop, has always been in the basement for the past. We've lived there almost eleven years, and that's where the workshop has been. But with her allergies, I feel guilty going down there. Like, I cannot use the workshop because I don't want to cause her more issues. So that's the only reason why I'm looking to do this, is to get the dust and all that out of the house and away from her as far as possible. But, yeah, so to me, it's more of. I mean, I would say, please consider it as an accessory structure that just happens to be placed where a garage would typically be placed, but it will have a garage door on it. So it is dual purpose to get the most use out of the space. What's the proposed dimensions again? Well, it's right there. Twelve by 30. Yep. It'll be twelve foot wide so that I can fit the truck in there easily. Plus, trying to manipulate a four by eight sheet of plywood need a little bit of room on each side to be able to maneuver it around. That's why I can't stay within the setback and do it as a separate stall. By the time you're trying to cut an eight foot sheet of plywood, you need room. So you could go nine and a half feet and be right at the property. Right at the seven foot setback, it would be eight and a half, I believe. And that would be the outside of the wall. And that would be the outside of the wall. So by the time you have the framing and the drywall and all that, you're right at eight foot. And, I mean, that's gonna get cockeyed and not work. It would not be safe, unfortunately, even to try to turn it sideways and cut from the would be the west wall to the east wall. You're still trying to maneuver an eight foot sheet of 4ft. To try to cut through 4ft. You need at least, you know, more than 8ft still to be able to safely cut an eight foot sheet or a four foot cut. It's just, unfortunately, it's impractical. Would it be open to have it any smaller? Would it be open to the existing garage? No, I would maybe put. Maybe put a man door in between, but not fully. No, no, it would be a man door, but otherwise. And that would even be closed a majority of the time. But then on the, on the south part of it, I would put a garage door on there so that it would be dual purpose and it would, it would look like it fits more in, in the neighborhood because there are a few other houses in the neighborhood that do have three car garages. So it would, it wouldn't look out of place to have vinyl siding for the entirety of it that's facing the street. And is there no way a structure could be put in the backyard farther back? I mean, I understand there's a hill or whatever, but it couldn't be built into the hill. Hypothetically, it could be done, but there again, you're still talking about you'd have to be able to walk back there and it gets very muddy and. But couldn't build a driveway. Yeah. You'd have to have a driveway to the, to the back, to the structure. Correct. If it had a six foot wide overhead, it would need to have a driveway. Okay. So it depends on the size of the structure that you would be detached. Correct. But by the time you, you factor in the setbacks for the rear and the side yard and all that, what, that hill, it would be very cost prohibitive. Question for you. So I see the deck and then behind the garage is the family room. According to this drawing that I'm looking at, at what point the deck does the ground start to fall off? Is it past the deck or is like right past the house, the ground starts to fall off. So if you can go back to the aerial view. Oh, you don't have an aerial. Oh, yeah. Yep, yep, yep. So the side property line. That. Nope, the other one. That one. That entire property. And Mike, my neighbor's property is all higher. So once you get past his fence into my yard, that entire line sort of drops off. Okay, then do you know, I guess I could estimate this drawing is this scale, but from the corner of the house, currently, that top right corner to the deck, what that measurement is. So if you look, I've got dimensions on there so that the deck width is 24. Looks like your kitchen is 26 and the kitchen is 26. And I believe the family room is 20 because it's the same width as the current garage.

So if you look, I've got dimensions on there so that the deck width is 24. Looks like your kitchen is 26 and the kitchen is 26. And I believe the family room is 20 because it's the same width as the current garage. I mean, compared to the twelve foot width, I'm guessing that space is probably five or 6ft. Yes. Yeah, yeah. And that's all drawn to scale pretty well. Okay. So. And there are steps that come down from the deck, actually onto a retaining wall that the area right behind. Sorry. Yeah, it's it's kind of hard to see there, actually. If you go back to the scale drawing. Yeah. Like where I wrote their side set back in green, that is all even elevation because I have a retaining wall that has built up that just barely gets past the deck and then it all drops off. I think you can see it. Oh, well, I think it's right. Yep. Right there. That thin kind of curved line, that's a retaining wall. You can kind of see the decks there. So that that whole area right behind where the new workshop will be is all flat. But I mean, once you get 10ft past it, it drops off dramatically. And like, the whole majority of the backyard is affected by all the, like, rainwater and drainage that goes down there. And then the other property line on the south in this picture also dips down from the front of my house, it dips down. So all the, all the rain that we get, concretes in the backyard, and it's just, it's a soupy, muddy mess. I guess what I'm trying to play in my head is once you get past the house, but before you get to where it slopes off, if your accessory building was l shaped, then that area, that last 10ft, the depth of the retaining wall, you could be 16 foot side to side. So where you'd be the eight and a half up front. Once you get past the house, it could be l shaped and have a bigger area for maneuvering the plywood, etcetera. I'm just playing with my mind what some of the options are. No. Unfortunately, with the only way to get off of the deck, the steps come off the right side in this picture towards that property. So to expand the workshop addition back further, there would be no access for the deck. And the deck would be right there, the steps down from the deck. Excuse me, the access from the family room to the deck. Is there access from the family room to the deck? It's. I would more considerate that it's on the kitchen side. Like it's an open concept, so that the kitchen kind of flows into the. Gotcha. The door is. If you can see the line between family room and kitchen, the door is probably just offset to the. Yeah, the kitchen side. Okay, so there's no outdoor access from where the family room is boxed in. No. To the deck, no connection to the outside, correct? No, there's not. And there would not be to the. To the new workshop either. The only access to it would be through the garage door. If I put a man door between the garage and the workshop and then I haven't. I mean, depending what the code says, if I have to have an exterior door on the right hand side of it to be able to get out of the garage other than through the garage door, depending on what code says or if they would allow it, I might put one there. Is that on the north side you said, or where would you want. The door would be on the right side in this picture? Probably up towards the front. So you. If this request would be approved, you have to have a firewall there, so you wouldn't want an opening there. Okay. So you. To the exterior? To the exterior. Unless it's a fire rated door. Well, yeah, that'd be fine. And then you would have to have a three foot landing area outside of that. Would that cause issue? If it's just a concrete pad, does that count for the. That's all. Building Co. We would work it out. Well, I didn't know if that would conflict with the setbacks and all that. Or does that not apply to a grading's allowed in the setback? Concrete works allowed in.

I'm not asking you mow with a weed eater if you had to, but it's just the fence. I think if there wasn't anything to the north and there wasn't a fill fence there, you know, visually, you could almost try to make the accommodation in your mind. But with that fence there, just that three foot alley is just. I mean, that's a pretty tight. Pretty tight configuration. My concern is. I think I voice it often is not today, but the future. Future owners. Future owners of the neighbor's house that it would encroach upon. And again, our requirement for the strict enforcement of the zoning ordinances.

At this time, I would like to ask our assistant city administrator and public works director Nicole Gleason to give you an update on 401 west fourth. Good evening, mayor council. Thank you for this opportunity. So, just to provide a background and context, staff had previously been working with the property owner and they had hired an engineer. The engineers report indicated they were unable to see portions of the building due to metal coverings on the facade. So staff then requested those metal coverings be removed, which was done last week, portions of those coverings were removed, exposing some wood. Upon reinspection Monday, staff was concerned with that wood. So to accelerate the process, we called in our structural engineers at Shaif Hattery and asked them to visit the site. The recommendations they provided yesterday are in front of you. I provided each of you with a packet. The recommendation? One. The building should be immediately evacuated. Due to potential unsafe structural conditions. The building may fully or partially collapse with little or no warning. So based on that, staff did proceed with contacting tenants, posting the doors. They were on site yesterday at approximately 330. And we did work with the county on some short term displacement assistance. As well as we've been in touch with residents on contact information for longer term displacement needs. So that's the status as we know it today. Thank you. Yes, thank you.

The first one is fair housing month. And that'll be read by Alderwoman Berkholter. Alderwoman Berkholter, please. Thank you. The city of Davenport. Proclamation. Whereas April 2024 marks the 56th anniversary of the passage of the Fair Housing act of 1968. And as such, we should acknowledge not only how far we have come in the last 56 years. But more importantly, what remains uncompleted in achieving the goal of complete freedom of housing choice for all persons in our country. And whereas individuals in the state of Iowa have the right to choose where to live and purchase or rent property without discrimination based on race, color, religion, age, sex, familial status, marital status, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, and gender identity. And whereas, housing discrimination continues to have both direct and a disparate impact on marginalized communities and protected classes and whereas, it is critical for the federal, state and local leaders and all community members to support the Fair Housing act and the fair housing enforcement agencies and their missions to eliminate housing discrimination in communities all across America, and whereas, it is a part of the american dream to build a life in the home of each person's choice, regardless of membership in a protected class. Now, therefore, we, Mike Matson, Mayor, and the City Council of Davenport, Iowa, do hereby proclaim April 2024 as fair housing month in Davenport to establish our community as open, inclusive, and committed to the fair housing and ensure that fair housing is exercised in Davenport and every community across America. Dated this 27th day of March 2024. I move the proclamation second. All in favor? Aye. All opposed? Okay. Yes. I'm Latrice. I'm going to present this to Latrice with our civil service. Civil rights. Sorry. I am on civil service. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor and council, on behalf of the commission, we would ask that the city consider revamping their rental licensing ordinance and address issues with absent or negligent landlords to avoid a situation like we saw unfold yesterday. If there is any need of assistance with drafting an update to the ordinance where we have stricter penalties or in any way develop a process for tenants to seek some sort of redress under our local laws, I'm more than willing to assist with that. Even though we currently lack resources. I can make time for that because I think that it directly impacts our current caseload. We see a lot of complaints involving negligent landlords who are not making repairs. People end up being displaced like what we saw yesterday and we've seen repeatedly. So I think on behalf of the commission, we would ask that there be some sort of update to the current ordinance where we can implement some sort of remedial action for negligent or absent landlords. Happy fair housing month. It's the 56th anniversary as stated in the proclamation. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Next proclamation, Child Abuse Prevention week. I'll read that proclamation. Whereas Davenport's youth are one of our community's greatest assets in ensuring that every child is raised in a safe, stable, nurturing environment is a shared obligation. And whereas child abuse can be prevented, it is vital that we, as a community, support parents and caregivers, as research shows that those who have support from family, friends, neighbors, and their communities are more likely to provide safe and healthy homes free of abuse and neglect. And whereas, too many of our nation's children are exposed to extreme and sustained stress, such as child abuse and neglect, which can be devastating to a child's development, and whereas, we lay the foundation for children's later growth and development when the entire community takes responsibility for creating healthy environments in which to raise our children, and whereas, the children in our community who have fallen victim to maltreatment deserve high quality, evidence based services delivered by committed and well supported professionals. And whereas, effective child abuse prevention programs succeed because of community partnerships created among families, social service agencies, schools, businesses, law enforcement agencies, faith based organizations, and other child serving agencies. And now, therefore, we, Mayor Mike Matson and the City Council of Davenport do, Iowa, do hereby proclaim April 1 to April 7, 2024, as child Abuse Prevention Week in the City of Davenport and call upon all citizens, businesses, and social institutions to support our community's children by helping to ensure they grow up in a safe, stable, and nurturing environment where their physical, emotional, and developmental needs are met. The City of Davenport Skybridge will display the color blue Monday, April 1 through Sunday, April 7. In recognition of child abuse prevention mode. Are we. I'll accept a motion to approve.

Thank you. Sure. Mister Mayor. Council, thank you again for this proclamation. Child Abuse Prevention Month is the entire month of April. Child abuse prevention week is that first week. But really, in my world, it's every single day. And in all of our worlds, child abuse prevention should be every single day. Really quick. How many of you have ever been the parent of a toddler? Okay, how about a teenager? All right, you guys should probably connect, right? Same brain spaces with those age groups. You can only give two step instructions. Well, maybe one. Same attention span. And tempers. And toddlers and teenagers. And right there, I just made a connection between parents to show that we are all in this together. Our community is here for us. Parents are all in this together. We should be okay asking for help. And every child works to make sure that parents know they can ask for help and that they have access to the resources that they need so that their kids can thrive, even if it's just another parent to talk to or maybe a counselor or a therapist if that child has been through trauma. So I greatly appreciate this proclamation on behalf of every child. And I encourage all of you tonight or tomorrow to connect with the child, either in your neighborhood, in your life, just to let them know that they have one more caring adult that's looking out for them. So, thank you. Thank you. Next is junior achievement day, and that will be read by Alderman Grimm. Alderman Grip, please. Thank you, your honor. It's my pleasure to read this proclamation. As a former participant in junior achievement and now as an adult, I'm entering into my third year volunteering at Eisenhower Elementary School with misses Cooke in her third grade class. This is a great program, and I'm happy to read this proclamation. Whereas, the City of Davenport will observe Junior Achievement Day on April 4, 2024, as an opportunity to recognize and celebrate junior achievement of the heartland, for empowering our community's youth to own their economic success. And whereas, junior achievement of the heartland's educational contributions equip our youth to become the next generation of productive employees and self sufficient citizens to ensure the economic prosperity of Davenport. And whereas, junior achievement of the heartland includes opportunities for educators, parents and community volunteers to connect classroom learning to life after graduation. And whereas, it is encouraged that parents, educators, businesses and other members of the community join junior achievements efforts to ensure the future success for the communities in which they live. And now, therefore, we, Mayor Mike Matson and the City of Davenport, Iowa, do hereby proclaim April 4, 2024, as junior Achievement Day in Davenport and call upon all citizens of Davenport to support the goals of junior achievement of the heartland and encourage the continuation of strong partnerships between businesses, education, community and our youth. Dated this 27th day of March, 2024, I move the proclamation. There's a motion and a second. All in favor? Aye. Are there any opposed? This proclamation has been approved. And I will meet Dougal Nelson, president and CEO of junior achievement of the heartland. So, thank you, your honor and council, and the citizens of Davenport who. Who really believe in junior achievement and make it possible. Those words were great con or alderman, and really appreciate what you said. Just to put it maybe into layman's terms, you know, junior achievement's the world's largest organization dedicated to providing students with the skill sets and the mindsets to build thriving communities. So when I think about the city of Davenport and I think about the future of the city, and I think about what junior achievement does, we're essentially the economic incubator, right? We're building these kids to come in and stay in the city and make the city great as it already is, you know, our volunteers are the magic that makes it happen. It's folks like yourself to go in the classroom and teach kids, you know, the connection between what they learn in school and really how it applies to the real world. We want them to understand the importance of providing for themselves and their families. We want them to be good, community minded citizens, and only volunteers can help that happen. So. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that today is Jersey Mike's day of giving, where 100% of the sales from Jersey Mike's will go back to junior achievement of the heartland today. They are a huge supporter of ours and it'd be a great way for you to support junior achievement and have a great sub while you're at it. So really appreciate it. Thank you very much, everybody.

There's 22 pieces total, and one student's artwork from each school was selected by his or her teacher to be on display at city hall for one year. So congratulations on the great work. And I'll meet at the podium, the respective members, to recognize these folks one at a time, these wonderful students. And as we do that, parents, move yourself where you need to to take pictures. And then for everybody's knowledge, please stay. We will gather in front of the dais here with the council at the end to take a big group picture. So please thank you so much for having us here. Thank you for your help in celebrating youth Art Month for the 2023 2024 theme one community, one heart we have all of our Davenport schools here. Thank you Davenport City Council this partnership for with Davenport Community School District for directing attention to the value of art education, encouraging commitment to the art by students, community organizations, and individuals everywhere, and increasing the community's understanding and interest in art and art education through involvement with this exhibit. Thank you students and art educators for your work and being here tonight. Thank you to our Davenport school administrators, school board, and building principals for your support in the fine arts and education. Thank you, parents, families, and friends for being here to celebrate your students and their work and accomplishments of being selected for this honor tonight. The first student that we have artist Charlie Heppner Central High School CAA in Mister Clint Balser's class this is an image I captured and transformed of downtown Davenport on a rainy night. I was out exploring the unique aspect of the city and this business caught my eye. The old feel and bright colors of the neon lights and the car gave me the feeling of stepping back in time. Atreyu Antonio Lee Van Meter Mid City High School Miss Stacy Jeffries class I assume everything I do in life is going to be a failure, and then if it turns up roses, then I'm psyched. Jonah Hill artist, London Vinger North High School Mister Kevin Gunn's class holding a perplexed state of mind that streams from my head to my eyes in such a colorful way, how can the world fill my sight with these lovely with these lively views? Artist Teen Tran West High School mister Dave Schaeffer I was drawn to the structure of the buildings. The structure seemed basic, but the small details added complexity to it. I chose to draw this in ink to challenge myself. Artist Ethan Snyder Creative Arts Academy Miss Colleen Tomlinson's class this piece represents an important place within the Davenport community to me. The bike path ever since I was a kid, the path has always been an escape from a normal day of life. Whether it's bike riding, walking, or exploring, the trail has always in some way clicked. Without it, I severely doubt I would be the person I am today. Artist Raya Scott Smart intermediate in Miss Melissa Hughes class living here has given me my friends and opportunities to draw and create. Artist Iris Gomez Diaz Sudlo, intermediate in Miss Colleen Tomlinson's and Heidi Hernandez's class I chose to make my artwork about multiple pieces because, like the title describes anywhere, with my big sister, Rihanna is my favorite place. My sister makes some of the dullest, most beautiful, boring places, some of the most colorful and fun environments. I chose an analogous color scheme of different shades of red and purple. The colors I chose capture the feeling of joy and relaxation. I'm proud of how I was able to make an accurate representation of my older sister. Artist Bree Hultgren Williams intermediate in Mister Brian White's class. I like the buildings that are downtown. I enjoy making the shapes and colors.

Artist Bree Hultgren Williams intermediate in Mister Brian White's class. I like the buildings that are downtown. I enjoy making the shapes and colors. Artist Amethyst Thomas, wood intermediate in Misses Kelly Rolfe's class. I chose the things I did to put on my paper because they represent me and Davenport. The most things like modern Woodman park, the Skybridge, and Duck Creek park are nice spots to go to and hold a lot of representation. The same thing with Vanderbirk. The two schools, wood intermediate and North High School, show the school I go to and plan to go to. Logos like the Bix and Davenport Community schools represent all of the schools in Davenport and show a marathon held Davenport often. Artist Callie Gilchrist Adams elementary in Mister Tony Ryder's class I've always liked public service careers like public works and firefighting. I really like using watercolor paints. It was hard to make the colors match. My favorite part about my artwork was making the shapes of the building. It took me three or four tries. This project was difficult for me because I normally draw faces. Artist Abigail Stiff, Bluegrass Elementary Miss Lisa Poolin's class I chose this picture because I thought it was a very pretty place. I wanted to try and draw it. Artist Miranda Wilkie Edwards, Buffalo elementary in Misses Danielle holders class, I chose to create a piece of artwork featuring the Centennial bridge. I think it is so pretty when it lights up at night. I use watercolors, oil pastels and tempura paint. Artist Harper Getsch, Eisenhower elementary and misses Kate Witherspoon's class I love the Figgy museum because of all of the art and I love the sky bridge because I feel like I'm floating. Artist Amelia powers from Fillmore elementary and Mister Derek Lum's class. I chose the figgy for my landmark because no one else picked it. It turned out better than I thought. Artist Luke Snar Harrison elementary in Misses Laura Carter's class here is my map. Art of Davenport, Iowa it made me feel good making such a beautiful piece of art. All these places I love and make me feel relaxed when I go to them. Artist Adeline Darnell Hayes elementary in Misses Ann Renfeld's class I really love drawing, so this is very exciting for me. The artwork was so fun to work on. I really tried to make it look similar to myself in Davenport Riverfront on the 4 July. I am thankful that it was picked. I always wanted to be an art teacher. Artist Liliana Flores, Jefferson elementary in Miss Liana Carter's class, I made my art about the bridge because I think it is beautiful. Artist Jada Clay from Madison elementary in Miss Haley Bernie's class, I wanted to draw the bridge because it always has fun, lights and it's new. I love drawing and art, and I like drawing at home. Artist Marian Driscoll from McKinley elementary in Miss Jamie Challis class, I chose the bridge because it is so pretty. The bridge shows off the best part of Davenport. The clouds and the sunset are so pretty over the bridge. Artist Alondra Jones, Truman elementary. Misses Erin Hunters class I picked Fejaver park. I've always been. I've been there once and it was the best park ever. The slides were the best. We saw the geese. I always went there. When I went there, there was a light snow. I want people to know about it because it's fun and not a lot of people have been there. Artist Aaliyah Messenger Walcott k eight. In misses Anna Blackburn's class, this is Sully. I chose to draw Sully for many reasons. One, she reminds me of walking home from school as I would occasionally see her in her front yard from time to time. She's very friendly and very pretty. There's also the old water tower in the background that's got taken down recently. So this certain picture of the of her refreshes my memory of it. Finally, she's a dog. I love drawing dogs, so this was an easy pick for me. And last but not least, Ainsley house log from Wilson elementary in misses Sarah Barr's class. This painting is special to me because I worked hard on it, and I think the bridge is a beautiful thing to see. Okay, council, kind of stand up and get close behind everyone. All right? Big round of clock. How did I know that? Thank you, everyone. We'll pause a moment. If the respective parents, families, guardians, students want to leave, you're certainly welcome to stay for the meeting. But if you want to go now, this would be a good time. And we'll pause until most folks have exited. Okay? Thank you, everyone. Next item is petitions, communications from council, anyone? Okay, very good, alderwoman McGinnis. Thank you, your honor. I just wanted to remind everyone that the city of Davenport will be closed on good Friday. And that's Friday, April 29, for the Easter holiday. I'll just. Wait a minute. I'm still. I get it. As people come in, if you'd please find your seats. I know that we were, you know, keeping a watch on the capacity, so just wait. We'll pause here a second. Okay. There's Dale. There he is. He's good. I think it's quite so. Again, the city of Davenport will be closed on Friday, April 29. City hall and public works are libraries, park and rec advent offices. The junior theater will be closed, open on Friday.

Thanks, mister mayor. You know, second your sentiments about the art and city hall recognition night. Cool night. Lot to see a lot of the talent of these kids, you know, as talk with some of my colleagues. You know, we're all amazed at what the students in our schools can do. You know, I've said this before. We can have all the jobs available. We can have all the housing available. But what I really feel makes people want to come live in Davenport and raise a family is a good, strong school system. And so I appreciate, superintendent Schneckloth, all of those involved with the school district. You know, we have many talented teachers in our school district. Here in Davenport, we have very many talented students. And a lot of times that just needs to be highlighted a little bit more. So I'm glad we can do a little bit of that on an evening like this. It's great to see. And then secondly, I want to apologize. I made an error last week in not looking at the schedule well enough. I called a special city council meeting for tomorrow, which I am going to call that we move because of a conflict on the schedule. And so therefore, I'm going to call a special city council meeting for Tuesday, April 2. 04:45 p.m. downport City hall council chambers for the purpose of holding an executive session pursuant to Iowa code and at the request of the employees to discuss personnel matters. I'll second. Thank you. Okay, that's good. Okay, everybody got the date? 445 Tuesday to April. Very good. Anything else? Good. Okay. Alderman Gripp, please. Thank you, your honor. I wanted to give the council in the public an update on the city administrator search process. We got back, I think, eight applications from the RFP for search firms to help us in this process. The committee is currently ranking those. Those rankings are due tomorrow. And then our next meeting is Wednesday, April 3. At that meeting, we will be interviewing executive search firms to hopefully decide on one. And then once we have an executive search firm selected, we will work with them to recruit and hire a new city administrator. We are still tracking for our target date to have the new city administrator in place by September 1 of this year. And I also wanted to provide an update that we did have on the committee there. It's a mixture of elected officials and citizens. We did have two citizens from the committee signal to the mayor that they're not going to be able to fulfill their duty on that committee for some personal reasons. So the mayor is currently looking for two replacements. And once he has the names of those replacements, I will provide that in an update to the council and the city as well. Thank you, your honor. Thank you, honorable alderman Kelly. Thank you, sir. First of all, I want to give a shout out to my mama. I ain't slick like that with them Bible verses and Diane. So I wanted to say, lean not into your own understanding. And when you know better, you do better. So I want to shout out 401 4th street and that sadness. And I see that the city is trying to move forward and do some things. I'm happy to see the small things that I'm seeing, but I know, like I said, when you know better, you do better. And on a good note, tomorrow night is the first night of my new ward alderman. Things that I'm going to be doing. It's called a night out with the alderman. So it will be at 1715 North Harrison street. It's a boutique called 563 vintage and the next door boutique as well, Keisha couture. So if you guys have nothing to do, come out and check out your alderman supporting his small businesses in his neighborhood. A night out with the alderman. And thank you, sir. Thank you, Alderman McKilley, alderman Newton. Thank you, mayor. A couple things. First, an update on the code of conduct. I want the public to be aware that a committee was formed. Consists of myself, Alderman Kelly, Alderman Jobgen, and alderman Reinart. We had the ability to meet with the Iowa League of Cities to get information and guidance on the law. What can be done. We were also provided with examples of other jurisdictions in the state of Iowa. Currently, we have our next meeting set for April 9. We would like to hopefully work as quickly as possible to get something to the council. I think the overall goal is to. To be able to put together a draft resolution to present to council. Second, unfortunately, the headlines of Davenport's perceived lack of transparency was the subject of a Iowa House committee meeting that took place today at eleven. I had the ability to watch a portion of it. And I will say some of the information or comments are of concern.

Thank you, mayor. A couple things. First, an update on the code of conduct. I want the public to be aware that a committee was formed. Consists of myself, Alderman Kelly, Alderman Jobgen, and alderman Reinart. We had the ability to meet with the Iowa League of Cities to get information and guidance on the law. What can be done. We were also provided with examples of other jurisdictions in the state of Iowa. Currently, we have our next meeting set for April 9. We would like to hopefully work as quickly as possible to get something to the council. I think the overall goal is to. To be able to put together a draft resolution to present to council. Second, unfortunately, the headlines of Davenport's perceived lack of transparency was the subject of a Iowa House committee meeting that took place today at eleven. I had the ability to watch a portion of it. And I will say some of the information or comments are of concern. I do think that Davenport needs to do better. And the only way that Davenport can do better is for this council to take lead and work together to ensure that Davenport again is working for the people. Last, but certainly not least, I would like to just highlight that March is women's history month. I know we didn't have a proclamation for that, but I certainly wanted to bring light the importance of the contributions that women make to our society, to our city, to our state, to our great country. And while as a country and a community, we have certainly moved forward, we still have progress to make. There are still disparities that exist, such as the wage gap disparity. And there's disparities just in treatment. Sometimes actions that a male takes are deemed as assertive or looked in a positive light. When the same actions taken by a woman can be deemed aggressive, defiant, difficult. So I want to say again, it's women's history month. To all the women out there, keep being aggressive. Thank you. I yield the floor back to you. Thank you, Alderwoman Newton. Anyone else? Very good. Okay, next item. There are no individual items on the discussion agenda. So is there a motion for approval of all items on the consent agenda? So moved. Second. So. Motion in a second. Brian, please call the roll for all items on the consent agenda. Brian. Arts? Yes. T.

My name is Bob Ingram. I'm your chair tonight. Welcome, everybody, to the plan zone commission meeting today. Tuesday, April 16. We will start with our public. No, let me back up just a second. We have a new member tonight that I'd like to introduce. She will be here in observatory mode. She will not really participate until her orientation this Friday. Erica Thomas is her name. She replaces James stuck. Erica, could you give us just a brief overview and let us know why you were interested in being on this commission? Sure. Thanks. I'm Erika Thomas. I'm a faculty member at St. Ambrose University. So I co direct our masters of public health program. So that's sort of my route into here is public health as sort of a housing interest. I also serve on the board of directors for Vera French. And so they're getting into the development game as well. So I thought I could learn a lot here. I'm excited to learn more. Thank you. I appreciate that. And I look forward to our orientation this Friday. We'll move on to our public hearing agenda. Roll call, please. Commissioner Tallman. Is she on there? Dunlop. Here. Echelberry. Here. Hepner. Here. Johnson. Here. Tallman. Here. Ingram. Manus. Here. Garrington is excused. Chilling. Here. Thomas. Here. Schneider. Present. We have a quorum, mister chairman. Thank you, Commissioner Tallman. First item, first and only item is case row 40 two. The request of the city of Danport to vacate a portion of Lorton Place between Lorton Avenue and Lombard Court. It is in the 6th ward. Matt. Thank you. So the proposed right of way vacation. It's at the intersection of Lorton Avenue, where it intersects with Lombard street and then Lorton Place. So it's a triangular intersection. The city of Davenport Public work staff is working on a road reconstruction project at this intersection and is proposing to vacate that small section of Lorton Place as it veers to the northeast. So the subject area is just under 4500. Intent would be to vacate that land and then convey it to the abutting property owner at 22 27 Lorton Avenue. So that's to the southeast of that corner. That area would just become a landscaped front yard for that homeowner. And their driveway would be extended to Lorton Avenue. So this is a design of the proposed intersection following reconstruction. So Lorton Avenue would continue to flow north to south, and then that vacated portion would be turned into green space. There is currently a sanitary sewer line that runs through there. So an easement would be put in place for access to that utility, as well as a telephone pole that exists at that location. Driveway gets extended to Lorton Avenue and then two new storm sewer intakes will be added at this corner to help address some of the stormwater issues. So drainage will be improved as a result of this project. So it's in a residential neighborhood. So we have residential zoning districts as well as residential general on our future land use plan. So the right of way vacation. It's a two step process. The first is to determine if the right of way is needed for public purposes, and then the second is to negotiate and determine the terms of conveyance to the adjacent property owners. That's dealt with through the city's legal department. So in terms of public input, property owners within 200ft were notified of today's public hearing. A public notice was also published in the Quad City Times. Public work staff has also been coordinating this project with abutting property owners. To date, we've received one written response in favor of the vacation and then had a phone call yesterday with a resident opposed to the vacation. Concerns that were raised during that phone call were the stormwater issues in the area as well as traffic impacts and how that intersection will function following the vacation. So for today, the recommendation is to hold the public hearing and then city staff will provide a formal recommendation at the April 30 meeting. Thank you, Matt. Commissioners, any questions? Matt? Staff. Commissioner Schilling, wouldn't the change your other button, please. Oh, I thought it. I got it. Okay. Wouldn't the change in that intersection actually help with some of the stormwater runoff? Yep. So the proposed reconstruction design is being engineered to help address some of that flow. So there'll be two brand new storm intakes that currently don't exist in that corner. So it won't necessarily address the whole neighborhood stormwater issue, but it will improve it at that intersection. Commissioner. Oops. Have parents no longer? Mister Chairman, Commissioner Schilling answered my question. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. I missed that. My mistake. I did not hear you. You made a motion. No, no. She addressed my question.

Commissioner Dunlop. Yes, Mister chairman. Just a quick question for staff. So is there any history on the property? Was that originally like an easement or something that was taken from the landowner or. It just seems like a weird intersection the way it was drawn up originally. Do you guys know any historical information about how it got that way or not? Not at this time, but we can take a look and see if we can find a little bit of history on it for you. I just wondered whether it was taken at some point in the past from the landowner, that's all. I mean, obviously it's been that way for a long time. I'm just curious why the strange configuration in the first place. But I don't know that it's not. I'm not asking for you to do homework assignment. If you don't know the answer, that's also perfectly fine. So we need an assignment. We need an answer. Thank you, Commissioner Dunlop. Any other questions of staff at this time? Seeing none. Would anybody from the public care to speak? If you do, I need your name and address and you got about three minutes to speak. Please step forward to the podium. My name is Robin Beagle Roberts. I own the property at 22 20 Lorton. I have been there for nearly 30 years and spent many years before that across the street. So I have quite a bit of history with this area. My first question is two new storms, sewers, intakes. Are those the ones that are currently there and just being redone? Those are two additional ones. There's two. Okay. I'm kind of lost as to where those are. Are those going into the court? So just for orientation, it's kind of turned sideways. So your property would be on that very top left corner. Okay. So it would be kind of where the existing street is right now. Can I show you where the water all flows from? Right here. All the houses from Jersey Ridge on Lombard and on Elm street, backyard empty out and flow right down here. So they are going. We have Elm street. That there's a slain hill on both sides that often stop and close. We have all the water coming from locust, all the way down. Then this is a. This area has already been made more into a hill to help this drainage. So we have all this drainage currently. It's going both ways. It's already going over the curve. Now you're going to have it go straight here. Straight here. And yeah, maybe this will help, but it's not going to help till it gets down here. This is tremendous amount of water. Tremendous. I can tell you it rips my yard apart constantly. It is tremendous amount of water. That is one concern. My other question is, why is this being done in the first place? It's been here 60 years. Staff, I don't have a direct answer at this point, but we can ask engineering. It was a capital improvement project and a street reconstruction. So. And we can absolutely get you in touch with the engineering people as well, we're just processing the vacation piece of it, but the reconstruction piece of it. We can definitely get you in contact with engineering instead of getting her in touch with engineering. Can't we get in touch with engineering and get answers by our next meeting? Yes, we can. Okay. That Boulevard currently is a beautification area to the neighborhood. It's very nice. It's very lovely. It's been maintained by the neighborhood for 60 years. Why are we changing something that beautifies Davenport? It does not make sense, let alone the amount of traffic that comes down. Now, you do have forests. That comes. Comes also down to feed that duck Creek area over there and down to 32nd. But we get a tremendous amount of traffic that comes down Lorton. And it splits because it's splitting to go to that whole side of Lorton. It's feeding those housing additions. Now, you're going to take all that traffic, and you're going to put it straight down Lorton. I don't see that beneficial at all. The other thing is my home and the home across the street. These are fairly large homes. Four bedrooms, five bedrooms, a lot of parking. Right now. They're able to park over here. We're able to park over here. It divides it up. It allows good traffic flow. Good traffic flow. We get a tremendous amount of emergency traffic down that street every week. Up on Locust by Lucas on Lorton, they're parking on both sides. The neighbors up there are already complaining. It's terrible to get through. Then you've got the fire trucks coming through all the time. I just don't see why this is beneficial at all and why it was never brought up. I think that's probably all I have right for now. Thank you. Anybody else? Good evening, all of you. My name is Malika Sri Khande, and we are all neighbors. I live on Lombard court. Can you give your address, please? Ten East Lombard Court. Dan, port, Iowa 52803. Thank you.

You know, there are lots of cracks and moss and all that kind of stuff. I would like improvement on those lines rather than doing what money is being spent here. So I'm basically at a loss to understand why I'm digging this beautiful green piece that we have at the center. That green piece also gets funds from our council month to make improvements. You know, they have their beautification funds and we ask for those funds. We get funds for that. And we've maintained that in the last 20 years that we have been. We are the newest residents, I would say. Then our neighbors are here. I need you to address us because microphone doesn't pick you up very well. Oh, I'm sorry. Turn around. I'm sorry. So we are the newest neighbors here to our neighbors. So I sincerely would like to know the purpose of this reconstruction or redoing that's going to happen. And if we have the money, let's put it on the street, which really needs repair. That's the court, as well as Lombard street and a few patches on the avenue and Lorton Place as well. Thank you very much. Thank you. Anybody else care to speak? Don Faust. We live at 26 34 East Lombard, which is right up there. I guess I would concur with what's been said so far. We've been there for eleven years and it's just got that little flower area is really kind of nice. I also was going to ask why it's being done, but I guess what I would like to see done and maybe that would be something, obviously, maybe not this meeting, but the north, or let me think here, that's the southwest corner right there. Every time it rains or we get snowmelt, there's a huge puddle there and I don't know how to get that to not be there. But it's dangerous in the wintertime because it melts and then freezes. And that's, I guess, something that I would like to see done. That one that they're talking about. I guess I'm kind of with these folks. So thanks. Thank you. Next final call for comments. Questions say none. Commission. Anybody have questions at this time? Commissioner Hepner? Thank you, mister chairman, staff. I've read blueprints for many years and it kind of looks to me like they're doing a reconfiguration of this whole area. And if I know engineering, they're going to fix this problem. Is that correct? That's our understanding. I will in the morning talk to engineering staff and we will make sure to have all those questions addressed and we will request that they also are present at the next meeting. Thank you. I would appreciate if engineering could be here. I am really familiar with this area. I live about a block away. So I have experienced the winter, I have experienced the ice. It is somewhat dangerous. It's hard to drive a car quickly in the winter over there or at the speed limit. Even so, I understand the concerns, definitely. But if I know the city engineers, this is going to be a help to the city and that area. An intersection? I would presume so. That's all I've got. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Hefner. Anybody else? Commissioner Manus. Thank you. Is there going to be an area that's been beautified and planted that is going to be destroyed through this project? I believe that some of the work that's needed, that will remove that area in order to get the storm intakes in. I do know that there has been some conversation. I will check on the detail level of that related to that and we will have answers for you at the next meeting. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Mainez. Any additional, Commissioner Dunlop, just a quick comment. It's along the lines. It sounds like we're going to have engineering there anyway. But since it's also within my background, I'd just be curious for them to lay out the difference between the storm sewer fix and the traffic. If there's a specific traffic, because you can solve the storm sewer issue maybe separately from the traffic. Why the traffic pattern is changing. So I'm just curious to understand that. So hopefully they can bring both of those issues and be prepared to discuss how they fit together. Or maybe they're two separate issues in their mind. I'm not sure what the challenges are that they were trying to address with this plan, so that'd be the question that I have. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Dunlop. Any additional seeing? None.

Tonight we have case ord 240 two request of the City of Davenport to amend section 17.08 of the zoning ordinance regarding billboard regulations. Staff recommends the Planning and Zoning Commission forward case ord 240 two to the city council with a recommendation for approval, subject to the proposed amendments and findings. And I so move second case ord 240 two has been moved and seconded for discussion. Matt, thank you. So just a little bit of overview. So in December of last year, city council passed a moratorium on new billboard development within the city. The purpose of that was really to evaluate our current regulations and identify any necessary code updates. So the City of Davenport, we currently have 73 billboards scattered throughout our commercial corridors, the downtown, as well as our industrial parks. So our current billboard regulations, so currently they're only allowed in four zoning districts, two of our commercial districts, and then our light industrial and heavy industrial zoning districts. Our zoning ordinance also outlines principal use standards which regulate the location of billboards. So they are prohibited along our interstate highway. They are also prohibited in historic districts and on properties with local landmarks. And then we also regulate distance from residential neighborhoods. So if a sign is less than 300 sqft, it must be a minimum of 100ft from any residential district. And then billboards over 300 sqft must be at least 150ft from any residential district. We also regulate the sign area, so there's a maximum sign area allowance of 672 sqft, plus an extension area not to exceed 153. Then there's a maximum sign height of 45ft. Billboards are required to meet the principal building setbacks of the zoning district that they're placed in. And then there is a separation requirement between billboards with a minimum distance of 1500ft. So our code allows up to four billboard sign faces on one structure that's allowed to be in the v configuration. And then we have two standards outlining how electronic billboards are regulated. The first being that electronic billboards cannot change more than once every 8 seconds. Static images with no animation are required, and the transition from one image to the next must not occur in 1 second or less. And then the second requirement is that electronic display must contain a default mechanism to show a full black image or turn the sign off in case of a malfunction within 12 hours. So throughout this process, city staff have been trying to identify some of the deficiencies with our city code. So with the feedback from city council, the public, and the plan and zone commission last meeting, we've been able to kind of categorize the areas of concern. So that's really addressing the brightness and intensity of electronic billboards, the oversignage of our commercial corridors, visual distraction that billboards have on motorists, impacts on the character of our residential neighborhoods, their proximity to the streets, and then separation requirements between electronic billboards. So city staff has a draft ordinance which is printed off in front of you. So on the slide before you, we have our definition of billboard in our current code, which is shown in black. So the code defines billboard as a permanent sign directing attention to a specific business, product, service, entertainment, event, activity or other commercial activity that is not sold, produced, manufactured, furnished or conducted at the property upon which the sign is located. So staff is proposing separate regulations that apply to a static billboard and separate regulations that apply to electronic. So in order to help us define those, we've added to our definition. So static billboards in ou", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Splendor Estates\",\n        \"positives\": [\"Preliminary plat approved by the city council; Final plat expected to come through the plan zone commission\"],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"buy\",\n        \"comment\": \"Approval of preliminary plat and expected final plat indicates progress and potential for development.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Nordaff, Second Edition\",\n        \"positives\": [\"Final plat approved by city council\"],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"buy\",\n        \"comment\": \"Approval of the final plat suggests positive development and potential growth.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"City of Davenport\",\n        \"positives\": [\"Working on updating and improving billboard regulations; Addressing issues such as brightness, intensity of electronic billboards, and visual distractions\"],\n        \"negatives\": [\"Moratorium on new billboard development; Restricted billboard regulations in various districts\"],\n        \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n        \"comment\": \"City is actively working on improving regulations, which can be positive.

So city staff has a draft ordinance which is printed off in front of you. So on the slide before you, we have our definition of billboard in our current code, which is shown in black. So the code defines billboard as a permanent sign directing attention to a specific business, product, service, entertainment, event, activity or other commercial activity that is not sold, produced, manufactured, furnished or conducted at the property upon which the sign is located. So staff is proposing separate regulations that apply to a static billboard and separate regulations that apply to electronic. So in order to help us define those, we've added to our definition. So static billboards in our code as proposed, would be defined as display. Static billboards display a fixed advertisement face where the face is not changeable within seconds or minutes, but where a change of face have to be re erected and affixed to the structure. So that would be your printed billboard or vinyl graphic billboard. And then electronic billboards are digital displays that can be changed within seconds or minutes by remote or automatic means. So typically that's your led or electronic computer display billboard. So there's a set of general regulations that are proposed that will apply to both static and digital, some of which are no change to our current ordinance. So we're keeping the regulation that they're prohibited along interstate highways along with billboard structures are prohibited in historic districts and adjacent to historic landmarks. A new standard is that billboards are prohibited within required landscaping areas as outlined in our landscape code. Reason for that being is we've seen some new billboard installations that are installed in required, for instance, parking lot landscape islands, or buffer yards, or landscaping that surrounds parking lots. So we want to make sure that that landscaping remains intact and this will reinforce that issue. Maximum height will remain at 45ft, and then e and f are both new standards. So creating a universal setback of 25ft from lot lines. So the c two district, there's no minimum principal building setback. So in that district, in effect, you could have a billboard placed right up to a lot line. Our c three and industrial districts have a minimum 25 foot setback. So we thought, let's make that uniform and create a little bit of distance between properties. And then f helps us regulate the separation requirements. So billboard distance separation shall be measured from the closest point of each billboard structure. This is measured in a straight line along either side of the right of way of the street. So that 1500 foot separation requirement. So if you're on the south side of 53rd street, that applies also to the north side of 53rd street. So changes to static billboard regulations. Really, we're keeping the same requirements in terms of the 15 100ft separation between static billboards. That will remain. The maximum sign face will remain at 672. With the extension area, the distance to residential district will remain at 300ft. The four billboard faces will also remain unchanged. And then the new standard standard e pertains to how they are illuminated. So that standard would be any billboard illumination shall be designed, located, shielded and directed to prevent the casting of glare or direct light upon roadways and surrounding properties, and prevent the distraction of motor vehicle operations or pedestrians in the public right away. So that's a similar requirement that we have in our sign code. So just, you know, this was a, I guess, a blind spot in your current code and how billboards are lit up at night. So then we have a set of new standards for regulating electronic billboards. So the first one being that they are prohibited in the c two corridor commercial district. This district tends to have smaller lots that are more built out. Davenport's commercial corridors are fairly well developed at this point with number of signage. So this will reduce some of the clutter on our commercial streets. We're increasing the separation requirements between digital billboards from 1500 to 3000, so we're doubling that distance. Some of the rationale there is electronic billboards are visible from further distances, given their nature of display. So this will kind of minimize the view shed as you look down a commercial street. So the maximum sign area is being reduced to 400 sqft. Electronic billboards shall be a minimum of 600ft from residential districts. So that's increased from 300 standard e up to two electronic billboard signed faces are allowed, and one billboard structure, a v arrangement, is permissible. However, no more than one electronic billboard sign face can be visible from any one street direction. So our current code would allow up to four electronic billboard signs, two facing the same way. Staff feel that that would be a visual deterrence in our community. So just limiting it to one clean static or one clean electronic display in each direction. Standard f is the same in terms of how electronic billboards change and rotate images. Standard g is the same, regulating when there's an error or malfunction that they must default to the full black image, and then f pertains to the illumination and the brightness component of electronic billboards. So that is, the maximum brightness is limited to 5000 nits when measured from the billboard's face at its maximum brightness during daytime hours, and 200 nits when measured from the billboard face at maximum brightness from dusk to dawn, the time of day between sunrise and sunset. The billboard must have an amb", "answer_v2": "[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Billboard Regulations\",\n    \"positives\": [\n      \"Implemented new standards for electronic and static billboards to reduce visual clutter and ensure safety.\",\n      \"Regulatory enhancements to prevent billboards in landscaped areas and historic districts.\",\n      \"Increased separation requirements between billboards and residential districts to minimize disturbance.\"\n    ],\n    \"negatives\": [\n      \"No specific business entity benefiting or being affected is mentioned.\"\n    ],\n    \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n    \"comment\": \"The regulations focus on urban planning and safety, but no specific business entities are discussed.\"\n  }\n]", "esg_v1": "[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"City of Davenport\",\n    \"observations\": [\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Electronic billboards are prohibited within required landscaping areas.\",\n        \"classification\": \"E\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Maximum height for billboards will remain at 45ft.\",\n        \"classification\": \"E\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"None\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Universal setback of 25ft from lot lines.\",\n        \"classification\": \"E\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Billboard distance separation requirement increased to 3000ft for electronic billboards.\",\n        \"classification\": \"E\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Prohibition of electronic billboards in the c2 corridor commercial district to reduce clutter.\",\n        \"classification\": \"E\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Electronic billboards must default to a full black image in case of error or malfunction.\",\n        \"classification\": \"E\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Illumination standard for billboards to prevent casting of glare or direct light upon roadways and surrounding properties.\",\n        \"classification\": \"S\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Linear separation requirement of 1500ft between billboards.\",\n        \"classification\": \"E\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Electronic billboards limited to one sign face visible from any one street direction.\",\n        \"classification\": \"S\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]", "esg_v2": [{"name": "City of Davenport", "insights": [{"observation": "Electronic billboards are prohibited within required landscaping areas.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Maximum height for billboards will remain at 45ft.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "None"}, {"observation": "Universal setback of 25ft from lot lines.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Billboard distance separation requirement increased to 3000ft for electronic billboards.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Prohibition of electronic billboards in the c2 corridor commercial district to reduce clutter.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Electronic billboards must default to a full black image in case of error or malfunction.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Illumination standard for billboards to prevent casting of glare or direct light upon roadways and surrounding properties.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Linear separation requirement of 1500ft between billboards.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Electronic billboards limited to one sign face visible from any one street direction.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1402894, "chunk_end_time": 1845916, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1no2055l21I", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1no2055l21I&t=1402s"}, {"start": 24000, "end": 30000, "text": "rangement, is permissible.

The billboard must have an ambient light meter, an automatic or manual dimmer capability to regulate illumination. I'm testing my vision right now, so, yeah, condition f basically will regulate our brightness component. Next slide. So in terms of timeline. So tonight the commission will take a vote, which is recommendation to city council, who will then have their own public hearing and have three readings on this item, which would place the final vote at June 3. So a day before the moratorium ends June 12. Sorry, next slide. So with that. So, staff is recommending the commission forward staff's proposed amendment to city council with a recommendation for approval. So the findings being that the amendment is consistent with our comprehensive plan. It promotes public health, safety and welfare, it's consistent with the intent and general regulations of the zoning ordinance. It reflects a change in policy and development trends. The amendment will create additional nonconformities. However, there are a large number of non conforming billboards, so existing non conforming billboards can continue to exist at their location. This code would not cause any billboard to be removed. That is the chair. Thanks, Matt. I have a couple questions. Since the brightness of a traditional board, compared to the new led boards are measured differently, does staff have. Do the inspection department have the proper readers to be able to determine what's compliant and what isn't? That's my understanding. So this actually is very similar language to our sign code right now. The one difference being less knits at night, and that's generally because of the size. And this is in line with some research that we did when we were looking at the code. So we should have the capability to enforce and that we would also give the billboard companies the opportunity to provide that data to us as well. When I asked that question this morning, I was heading to a job site at 04:00 and I was on arterial street that had a, I don't know, two foot by three foot sign advertising the business. And I'm here to tell you that white light, at that time in the morning, it had yellow lettering. I couldn't read it. The white light was so overpowering. And I just wonder if it's within regulation. I've seen some. I realize leds appear brighter than your standard signs, but I just want to make sure that if they're turned in as being non compliant, that we've got somebody that can measure that. Yep, that's my understanding. So if you. We can, we can double check that if you give us the information, I'd appreciate it at some point in time. That being said, commissioners Commissioner Schneider, I'm wondering is what is the impact on the existing signs that are within the city now with the new changes so they would be able to remain in place and they are able to maintain their status and make any repairs as necessary. They follow our nonconformities section under the use, which enables them additional time to repair if something happened to it, so they would be able to reestablish it. Is there a particular billboard vendor that might be more impacted than others? And I don't need names or anything. I'm just wondering if that. I'm wondering, will there be a reaction? There's one billboard company that owns the majority of the billboards, so that would be the main pushback, I think, that we would receive. Thank you, Laura. I'm a little surprised that we had nobody here from the ad companies at our public hearing. Has there been pushback? Are they even aware of these changes? I believe we might have someone here today, but we'll get to that in a minute. There's been a couple phone calls, kind of wondering what's going on and what specifically it's speaking to, so nothing major at this point, but we will. Well, I'll let a gentleman speak if. Well, and normally, I'm trending back to our old plan and zone rules of not allowing people that don't show up at a public hearing to speak at the night. We vote on it. I will allow this tonight, but I will be trending back to our old standards. Yeah, there was significantly bad weather at our last meeting as well, there was a blizzard. So we were all here just saying. Commissioner Johnson. Thank you, mister chairman. This kind of goes just along with Jane's. I was just curious, of the 73 billboards that we have, how many will now or approximate percentage will be nonconforming? And then are the new nonconforming, if this creates new additional, are they notified and how does that work? Do you want to go back to that map? Yep. So of our 73, as you can see, we have quite a few in our downtown. So all of those as they stand today are non conforming. So those will remain non conforming. Any billboard in our c two district, so we've got a few on 53rd in Kimberly. So those would be potentially added to our non conforming list. Again, they could still continue to operate and be in use.

No, not outside of just normal publication, that it. Thank you, Commissioner Dunlop. Thank you, chairman. Just a question about the non conforming again. So with the electronic side, I mean, I can understand, you know, grandfathering structures that cost significant, you know, amounts for someone to change. But like, if there's a public safety concern over the brightness of an electronic sign that existed previously and the person could turn that reasonably, turn it down, you know, through electronic means, is that something that the city would consider pursuing? I mean, I realized, like I said, grandfathering in or putting an undue burden on someone that had no ability to perceive that that was going to happen. But, you know, now that you're dealing with an electronic scenario, what options would there be to try and, you know, request conformance for brightness? Thank you for bringing that up. That is actually our intent for the brightness component specifically would be to reach out for any complaint based ones we receive to ask them to comply with the new standards. We did talk to our legal department about that as an ability, and we can write that into the language of the ordinance that would give them a certain period of time to comply if they have that capability already installed on their billboard. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Dunlop. Commissioner Manas. Thank you. I'm sorry I wasn't here on April 2. I was out of town. This is a really significant amount of work the staff has done, I guess I just wanted to ask you, where did you investigate and come up with the standards that you're recommending? Did you look at national recommendations at certain other communities? What was your source to make this proposal. Yes to all of that. So we did research other Iowa communities specifically knowing that that state by state, there's some specificities related to that. So we did research to other Iowa communities. We read through some policy statements from some of the larger outdoor advertising groups out there, and then we read through some more research based papers that were out there from dots related to recommendations on brightness. But this was totally in house. This is a big piece of work that you're submitting. So I thank you. Thank you. It's good work from the staff. Thank you, Commissioner Manus. Any additional questions or comments from the commission? See none. Would anybody in the audience care to step forward and identify yourself? Make your statements known. You need to step up to the podium, identify yourself and address. My name is Chad Haker. I'm with Huntington billboards. We're not local. We have Iowa billboards, but not in Davenport. Thank you for the opportunity. We were really here just to hear what the new regs were going to be. That. That's why we weren't at the last meeting, because there was going to be no new regs. So there was nothing. We didn't know what you were changing. So with the blizzard and all that, we kind of. They said we would have the opportunity to hear the new regs today. And so that's why we're here. So that's really that. You know, we've been around this long time. The changes, quite honestly, are not huge. So from that perspective, that's probably why you don't have any advertising companies here, because they're just not a big change in those regs. So thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate your participation. Anybody else from the audience or commission see? None. Roll call, please. Commissioner, Salman Dunlap here. Yes. Sorry. That's fine. That was earlier. Yeah. I'm new. You can't say that anymore. Echelberry? Yes. Hebner? Yes. Johnson? Yes. Talman? Yes. Manus? Yes. Schilling? Yes. And Schneider? Yes. Motion carries, mister chairman. Thank you, Commissioner Talman.

Matt, you want to go ahead? Okay. So subject properties highlighted in yellow. So just off of Hickory Grove Road, and then behind is the intersection of Kimberly and Fairmont. So the property, it's owned I one, which is a light industrial district. The site's currently red barn storage. They're looking to do an expansion of their site into the lot to the south. So as part of that, they're combining the two parcels to facilitate that development, shown as regional, commercial, and it's within our urban service boundary and our future land use map. So before use the proposed plat, combining the two lots into one so they'll maintain their current access point onto Hickory Grove. So real purpose is to combine the lots and establish easements for that development. So with that, city staff is recommending approval. So the plat conforms to our comprehensive plan, prepares the area for future development, and is consistent with our subdivision requirements. So we're recommending six conditions, two of which are fairly standard, removing building setbacks, lines from the plat, which aren't required. Four, to establish needed utility easements on the plat and include a note vacating any unused easements. Then there is a creek on the east side of the lot. So to provide a 50 foot drainage easement associated with that creek and then to include a note for stormwater detention that is required by the property owner and upon development. Thank you, Matt. Commissioners, any questions at this time? See, none. I have a couple as well. Hog the microphone some more. What does regional commercial allow at that facility? Does it allow car repair and outside storage? And the reason. Let me give it back. The reason I ask. I've lived in this neighborhood for as long as I can remember. I drive by it multiple times a day. It used to be a screw machine facility with a couple homes there, the owners of the company, and they did great job, great business, everything. And it kind of expanded where they put some other equipment into a new building. And with that expansion, when they eventually closed the business and moved on, now all of a sudden the storage component comes into play where businesses or a business has popped up using the outside garages and now we're working on vehicles and storing them outside. And I'm curious if that's even allowed. Yes. So it's I one. So both minor and major vehicle would be allowed. There are some provisions as principal use standards associated with that, that they can work on the vehicles while dismantled, but they're not supposed to be stored as dismantled outside. So if that's an issue, let me know. The goal of this is to prepare the site to be a boat and rv storage facility, specifically all indoor. So they would be indoor? Well, our definition still calls them outdoor because there will be overhead door access from the outside. They're not. You don't enter the building and then access the units. So that's how, that's our differentiation between outdoor and indoor in terms of outdoor storage. So I believe one building that's remaining on, they're doing significant demolition and removal of some of the buildings as part of that project. So one of the buildings that's remaining is indoor storage. So you enter the building and then they have the overhead doors on the inside. So that would be more of your traditional, like, you know, I'm moving or things like that kind of storage. Well, my concern is I'm assuming that the homes will be torn down if they're on this property. So when I say outdoor storage, I'm talking about a big fenced in lot with a whole bunch of rvs sitting outside. So there'll be structures. So all of them will be in a structure. That's my question. And then part two is, as I briefly discussed with you earlier, Laura, and I know you say that doesn't need to be one of the points of one of the conditions is there isn't a single square foot of poured concrete or asphalt on that property, except where they've torn down a building. Will this all need to be paved? And is the petitioner owner aware of that with hard surface? Yes and yes. So we do have the site plan in hand. They are removing a lot of the existing surfaces and we'll be replacing them. I know that there is some illegal gravel area out there right now. We stopped work, ordered that a while ago, and that will be used as the sub base for some of the paving area. That's fine. And then the nice thing in this situation is, because they're going to construct new buildings, we will hold occupancy and they will not be able to use the buildings until that pavement. Thank you.

Communications, anybody? I need to communicate something. I want to apologize to everybody for my earlier discombobulation. My concern was I love having my laptop here, so I can reference back and forth. I can look at maps. I'm not one that wants to waste a bunch of papers printing hundreds of pages. Have you figured out why I can't download the new software? I mean, it might be your device. I referenced back year, two years looking at packages that we did in the past, and now I can't figure out. I even took to my it person where I work. They couldn't figure it out. Okay, so let's take a look at it, because I know that there was a problem initially with how it was interfacing with some iPads and tablets. We went back after you'd mentioned it last meeting. Afterwards. To me, when you sit at a desktop, it works. So we need to take a look at what you have. So if you want to bring it in and I can voice, we can take a look at it and then we can talk to it. Maybe our next one on one meeting. I can bring it with me. Seriously? I couldn't figure it out again today, even. It doesn't surprise me at all. I mean, it's still new. So thank you for your patience and dealing with that. So if anybody has any struggles in how to navigate the new system, let us know. It did not work on my desktop. It didn't work on your to download it today before the meeting. Okay. It didn't work on my laptop either. I don't have an Apple iPad. Nothing. It's simple laptop. Commissioner Hepder, do you have, like, an Apple product, or is it PC? I've got an Apple phone, but PC is not. Okay, thanks. We can talk a little bit after, too, see if we can figure it out. Okay.

I called the city council meeting for Wednesday, March 13, 2024 to order. At this time, we will have a moment of silence. We've had. We've had two young people's lives change dramatically in the past week. One is no longer with us. And one has made catastrophic decisions, probably for his behavior. And they're both affected and their families. We've had people heard in incidents just today and yesterday. And so I want to. Maybe we'll keep those in our thoughts as we have a moment of silence. Thank you. Okay, now please stand and join me as alder one Brookholter leads us in the pledge of allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the glad of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands. One nation, invisible, with liberty and justice for all. Mister Crock, would you please call the roll? Ardon. Here. Kelly. Reinarts. Here. Grip. Here. McGuinness. Here. Newton. Present. Lynch. Here. T. Dunn. Here. Job. Gin. Here. And Berkholder. Here. Ten. Present. Thank you. Good evening. As we begin this meeting of the city council, I would again like to welcome all those in attendance, those viewing a meeting on your computer or mobile device. Respectfully welcome your comments and opinions. Please keep in mind that as you talk to the council, you're sharing your thoughts with fellow Davenporters, with viewers throughout the region. As city council meetings are recorded and available on the City of Davenport website for viewing, we are happy you're participating in your city government. We ask that your participation reflect the common desire we all share to make Davenport an even greater place for our citizens. For those in attendance and those watching at home, thank you for joining us at this time. As always, we would ask that you turn off or silence your cell phones and any other electronic handheld devices so that they don't interfere with anyone who might be speaking. If you wish to address the council on a specific item on the discussion agenda, you're encouraged to do so. During that discussion item, please step to the podium and state your name and address or award. And you'll have five minutes during the public with business portion of the city that will occur near the end. Members of the public may step to the podium and address the city on any matter related to the operations of the city, but not related to anything on this agenda for three minutes time. When I. When addressing the council, please wait until I recognize you and then speak to the council as a body and not to a single member. I ask that everyone observe, and I know you will, the commonly accepted rules of courtesy, decorum, dignity and good taste. And I thank you will an all remove approval of the city council meetings for February 28, 2024. A motion has been moved and seconded. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed? Same sign. Those minutes are approved. And is there a city administrator update this evening? Nothing tonight, Madam Pro Tem. Thank you. Will an Oliver remove approval of the report on the committee of the whole for March 6, 2024? And anyone could we have all in favor, please say aye. Aye and opposed? Same. Sorry. We have four appointments this evening. I will read the appointments and ask for approval. These are all reappointments. The first for the Civil Service commission, Toby Payone, reappointment. Gerald Thompson, reappointment, and then for planning and zoning commission, Pat Schilling, a reappointment and Thomas Heppner, a reappointment. I will accept a motion to approve these appointments. Second motion has been moved and seconded. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed? Same sign. Those appointments are approved. And thank you to everyone, these individuals and everyone who takes time to serve on our boards and commissions. It's now time for petitions and communications from council members. And so is there anyone, anyone from the council that has anything they would like to. And I'll call on Alderman Reinhardt. Thank you. I have two items. First off, we will be holding the 8th ward meeting this Thursday at the Eastern Avenue Library from six to 730. Secondly, on a sadder note, Tuesday there was a traffic fatality in the 8th ward. My heart goes out to the family regarding this tragedy. I'm very sorry. They're in my prayers. In response to neighborhood concerns, since February 22, traffic control measures have slowed traffic around the schools, and crosswalks are scheduled to be paid as soon as the pavement warms up. Also, traffic studies have been started as early as March 8. No, I'm sorry. Back to February 8 on two main east west arteries. And once completed by March 22, we will start on both north south, addressing traffic concerns in the Ridgeview area. Again, I'm very sorry for the tragedy. People are in my heart and in my prayers.

Thank you. Thank you very much. Kind of along those lines. I think usually around this time, it's always a good reminder, you know, as we start to come out of our hibernation, the weather comes nicer and more people are out and about more pedestrians. You know, when we're behind the wheel. Former alderman Condon used to talk about my behind the wheel kind of brain and kind of get going. You know, we just got all take that time to just slow down, watch out for those that are around us, and definitely know that the extra 30 seconds or a couple minutes that you would get to where you're going by driving a little faster isn't really worth it in the end. Secondly, just wanted to point out that tomorrow there's a couple forums on the community id. I won't claim to be the biggest advocate or spokesperson for this, but something that I've been involved in a couple conversations. When we had our interim city administrator work plan, the community idea was brought up. I know the city of Moline has been looking at implementation, so since we have a room of civic minded people here, if you weren't aware that there are two forums tomorrow put on by QC Interfaith, the first one during the day is two to 330 at Case I Senior Center, 1035 West Kimberly Road, and then in the evening from six, six o'clock to seven thirty at St. Ambrose Rogowski center. Hopefully that doesn't steal thunder from the 8th ward meeting, but just thought that might be something that people would be interested in. I know I brought it up at the last six ward meeting, and it was kind of a novel concept to many people that attended there. So interested to hear from people and interested to see what occurs. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Jojen and Alderman Kelly. Thank you so much. I would just like to say a few things as well. So I want to give a heartwarm sincere to the Bailey family that lost a young lady on the corner of locust and grand in my ward. A senseless act. So I definitely want to put in on that. And I am part of GVI, but I definitely want to be more involved in my ward, in my city when it comes to these senseless, gun violent acts. So I just have to say that. And on March 28, the night out with the alderman will still be at 563 vintage and Kesha couture's boutique. I think it's 1715 North Harrison. It'll be a good time. Definitely something different for award meeting. And Diane, proverbs, truth and wisdom are precious, so do not expose them to ridicule by foolishness. So you guys know what I'm talking about. So we need to do more than just show up. It's time to show up. Speak, vote, be present. Don't just sit here days of just sitting idly by. We need to know what an ally is. We need to know somebody that's working with us instead of we know who's against us. We can't say nothing, but I'm going to be the one. If you want to talk to me afterwards, I'll be like, you know better. When you know better, we do better. All right. Thank you, Alderman Newton. Thank you, Madame Pro Tem. I want to address a question that I received yesterday by more than one constituent in regards to the front page of the quat city times, in regards to the close sessions that are being disputed by the city of Davenport. In an effort to promote transparency, I want the public to be aware that such was not a dispute made by council. It is my understanding that the legal department conducts those decisions. As to legal matters, it's not something that the council decides. That said, I know that myself and a few of my colleagues do have questions. So I would like to request an executive session regarding pending legal matters to be set for next Wednesday. If any of my colleagues would like to second my request, I would appreciate that and take it at this time. I second. Thank you, Alderman Newton. I don't believe we can take a tonight. Is that correct? Okay. Thank you. All right, so we will move forward. I do have. I had a couple of things. Alderman Grep, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Thank you. I've got a couple of things this evening. So my apologies for missing last week, I was on a trip with the mayor to Washington, DC. We were with the Quad Cities chamber team, and we were meeting with our congressional delegations, talking about issues important to the Quad Cities. But while we were there, we also took some time to visit with different federal departments to build relationships, but also to talk about some specific topics. We met with FEMA, the EPA, economic development, Department of Justice, and a few others. We had good conversations around our water pollution control plant project that we have ongoing, ongoing flood mitigation efforts, crime reduction efforts, and future economic development sites. But I did want to take just a minute and give some credit to Chief Bladell and the Davenport Police Department. We had a very positive meeting with the DOJ, as some people may know. We just ended a three year partnership program with the DOJ on crime reduction, specifically violent crime. And we spoke with the director, and she had nothing but praise for Chief Ladle and the Davenport Police Department.

They implemented suggested solutions and they're sustaining them. And she mentioned that Davenport was exactly the kind of community that the Department of Justice would like to continue to work with in a number of different ways. So thank you, Chief Bladel in the Davenport Police Department and anybody who followed the GVI briefings that we've got, we have seen violent crime start to turn the other way because of a lot of different efforts. The second thing I have for you this evening is I wanted to take a minute and update the public and the council on our efforts to recruit a new city administrator. The council received an update from Miss Merritt earlier today. But I wanted to make sure that we're continuing to keep the public up to date as well. So if you'll remember from my first update, in January, the mayor appointed a special search committee as required by the code. That is eleven members, four elected officials, and seven members from the public. We held our first meeting on February 9. Mo Heider from Rhythm city was elected as the chair and I was elected as the secretary. And as part of the secretary's duty to report back to the city council whenever there is news. So we did have some new news this week. The RFP that the committee put out on February 12 has closed on March 11 at noon. And we received eight responses. So that team is going to go through and score those responses. We will do interviews on April 3. And following those interviews, the committee will make a recommendation for a search firm to the city council. And our goal is to have it appear on the April 17 council cycle. So if the city council approves that contract on April 24, we'll spend the next. The committee will spend the next month working with the firm that we hired. And our goal continues to be to have a new city administrator on board by September 1 of 2024. And that's all I have. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Grip. So I will. Just one thing I had. I wanted tonight. The third word meeting will be on Monday, March 18, at 630 here at city hall. And that's just the regular time. We're back on that. No interruptions. So that's Monday, March 18, right here at city hall at 06:30 p.m. and you're certainly welcome to join me. Thank you. Anybody else? I see no one else. So we will move forward with our agenda tonight. Our next area is individual approval of items on the discussion agenda. We have two items tonight. The first is a resolution ratifying Executive Order 20 23 22. Appointing Mallory Merritt as interim city administrator. Ratifying personnel memorandum of understanding between the City of Davenport and Mallory Merritt. Memorializing Miss Merritt's appointment as interim city administrator and approving amendment one to the personnel memorandum of understanding between the City of Davenport and Mallory Merritt. Before we go to public with comment, I want to remind everyone again we are operating under the accepted rules of courtesy and decorum. I'd like to point out that for the agenda posted last week and tonight, both parties to the agreements had asked for last week's executive session. Public statements at last week's meeting were incorrect on this point. Also, unfortunately, there were several instances of inappropriate personal attacks or insults, as well as conversation in the chamber as we were trying to conduct business. This does not align with our council guidelines of conduct. The two items on our discussion agenda tonight relate to agreements with two city employees. I urge everyone to stay on that topic. Avoid personal attacks, speak to the council as a whole. And with that, we welcome your comments, feedback and opinions. Is there any public with comment? And you will have five minutes to speak. Yeah, my name is Gary Ekman and I live in Davenport. And last week. I do want to apologize. I did not say that she was the personnel director previously or that she was the direct supervisor of the neighborhood department. I did say that one of the two assistant administrators were.

So I don't know exactly what she's done. She was not above the neighborhood department, which is a point in her favor. She was not in the personnel directorship, which is a point in her favor. So in some sense, she's a blank slate to me. I don't know what she's done or anything. So she may be the most wonderful person in the world. So maybe that's possible. But my experience, not just in the last three years, since the stalking campaign began, but in the last 25, 40, 50 years or more that I've been paying attention. There is a language that is used in city hall. Mister Eglin, you are off topic about this agreement. I'm going to have to gather you down. I don't want to do that. Speak. I will be very clear about my position. I believe that anyone in her position has heard the term lowlifes and probably the n word. Sir, sit down. Please sit down. Who's next? My name is David Ezra Sidren. I live in the third ward. This document, dated January 25, 2024, is a subpoena from the Iowa State auditor addressed to the Davenport City Council. Mister Sydron. Yes. We're talking about the agreement. The agreement with the employee with Miss Merritt. That's mayor pro tem. I assure you I will be getting to the point. Well, I would ask you to get to the point. I will get to the point very soon. Thank you. This is a subpoena to the city council. Subpoena is a mangled lawyer. Latin. The phrase is classical Latin is pronounced sub poena and it means under penalty. You can actually be put in jail for ignoring a subpoena? It happens all the time. I have it on good authority that you, the Davenport City Council, were unaware that the state auditor had issued a subpoena. I have it on good authority that you, the Davenport City Council, was purposeful in the job, was purposely kept in. Would you please get to your point? We are not. I will be glad to get to the point. We're talking about a personnel agreement with a city employee. Would you please get to the point? Please? Please give me my five minutes. We're talking about this agreement. Please get to that point. I will get to the point and you will not like it when I get there. I have it on good authority that you, the Davenport City Council, were unaware that the City of Davenport decided to sue the state auditor to try and quash the subpoena on February 15, 2024, one day after the City of Davenport decided to sue me to keep from giving up the same public documents. I have it on good authority that an elected official repeatedly denied the Davenport City Council that the city auditor was even investigating the events leading up to the massive payoffs for Spiegel, Thorndike and Torres and the events leading up to the collapse of 324 Main street and the resulting loss of life. But misses Merritt and Mister Hyer knew. They knew. And they hid this information from you. Every time you passed Misses Merritt in the hall. She knew. Every time she spoke to the city council, she knew. For months. She knew the truth. And she kept it from you. And now the city council is deciding if misses Merrit should get yet another raise. A $50,000 raise, presumably for hiding important information from the city council. Does anybody on the city council even know what misses Merritt is currently being paid? If you think you do, you are probably wrong is Misses Merritt paid more or less than $200,000 a year? You don't know? Nobody seems to know. Because of another executive order that outside counsel knows to be illegal, gave Misses Merritt a bonus last year and now she wants another bonus. Misses Merritt is not qualified for this job. She was not qualified when she was hired. I am now going to quote from a deposition of Misses Merritt from another lawsuit that the city of Davenport lost and cost the city hundreds of thousands of dollars. Question from attorney to Misses Merritt. Other than the city of Davenport, your only work experience was at a chick fil A in high school? Misses Merritt's response. High school? Yeah. Question from attorney to Misses Merritt. Quote. And then you started as a budget analyst and then you became an assistant to the city administrator and now you're the human resources director. Misses Merritt's response. Correct. What an incredible american success story. From working at a chick fil a to a city administrator in only a few short years. How did she do it? Perhaps the answer from another deposition in the same case will shed some light. Question from attorney to Corey Spiegel. Are there folks within city hall who you would consider friends outside of work? Answer from Corey Spiegel. Yes. Specifically, Mallory Merritt, Nicole Gleason, Rich Oswald, Tiffany Thorndike and Samantha Torres. Where have we heard those names before? And that's how you go from Chick fil A to city administrator, from minimum wage to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. It's not what you know, it's who you know. I beg you to vote down another $50,000 giveaway to misses Merritt. Please, please, please stop this madness now. Thank you. My name is Cody Elip. I spoke last week.

I'm really just up here to say again that I'm doing three jobs right now. And I'm not asking for $50,000 for doing that. But I will be filing an equal pay claim if you guys pass this. Thank you. Next. Just so you know, I'm the actor in the family, not him. Look, y'all were elected to do a job. You were elected to fix the city. And if you do the right thing and you do what's necessary to make sure that this doesn't happen, we will back you up and we will make sure that people know who you are. Do the right thing. You know what the right thing is in 8th ward? I'm sick of the stupidity. I am sick of seeing people suffer who are barely getting by. And you guys want to give another $500,000 to not just one person, but two people give me a break. You are bankrupting our children and our grandchildren with these stupid things. Give it to our police officers, give it to our first responders, but don't give it to people that push papers around and make deals in the dark. Come on. Lashona Dixon, seven ward. I've been out of town for the last 33 days, and I had to make appearance here tonight because I'm troubled, very much troubled to the people who are. Don't take offense to what I'm saying. Okay, we have problems. How do you go from chick fil a to this? By friends. And it's not fair. And then her friends that got her in the door has messed up severely. Gotta put a stop to it. They have problem after problem. Her friends. I wish I could walk in here off of my friend, but that can't happen for me. And I wouldn't dare come off of somebody else's back in here to mess up some more. And do you want to give her $50,000? Cause she got in here on her friend's back. She don't know how to do the job, probably. So what I would recommend, get her out and find somebody that does and who knows how to do the job, not coming in here off of their friends work, because that means you could put any of us in here, and we'll come in here and do it for probably the $50,000 a year. We gotta be real here. So make it right, and you gotta also make it make sense. Just do that. It was disgusting to watch online for the last 30 days. Really? We have a big problem here. And if y'all guys don't stand up and say, no, we're not doing this, then that means you choose to let it continue. We're gonna be. There's a city in Illinois right now that mayor is running amok. We're next. Dalton, Illinois. We're next. I don't know why the press isn't on this right now. Because they're missing it. This is not y'all. We're above you guys. We voted for y'all guys to be here. So do the right thing. And I'm asking y'all just to do stand on business at this point. Just do that for us. That's all we're asking you to do. Hi, I'm Sheryl Shagnine, third ward. And I believe after last week and the week before, we have a lot more information for you to review. And in that full disclosure that has come across in public discussion, which has threatened to be taken away from us in violation of city ordinance 2015 156 unilaterally by the mayor and only the mayor. I know. Point of order to the point to the thing we're discussing now, please. The best indicator of past, of future behavior is past behavior, if you speak to the experts. And when we think about past behavior, I mentioned last week that 324 Main street building. The city administrator, the assistant city administrator, shared the same space, the same office. People had to come in saying, 324 Main street. Oh, they did. Utility company came in saying, three, two more main street. Electric companies came in saying, three, two, four main street. Fire department came in saying, three, two, horn. Main street. It fell on deaf ears. You all think we're blind. Our ears are not deaf. With full disclosure, you all have a responsibility to vote no to the bonus. What it sounds like city hall has become is an episode of Big Brother and Survivor. Out with outlast, outlie, outplay. I ain't playing. We, the citizens of Davenport, are not playing. We're done playing. You guys showed your true colors. Executive order 2023, whatever number it is, should not be passed tonight, should not be ratified by this city council. If you listen to the people in your ward, you would not say yes to $50,000, a bonus for rewarding bad behavior. I have huge issues with rewarding bad behavior. I understand the city employees. It's called quiet quitting when they do the minimal to get by. I'm going to ask you not to speak ill of city employees. I asked this at the beginning. I'm not speaking. Do not do that again. Do not do that again, please. I'm not speaking ill of single. Please speak to the agreement. City employee. Other than the one that is up for the $50,000 bonus, we just had two brave city employees come up last week. One came up a second time tonight, and he said he will be filing paperwork for equal pay if this is passed. Come on, people, open your ears. Are you deaf? Are you blind? I am not.

Cheryl Shagna, third ward. Vote no to ratify this agreement. The implied part of the agreement has not been met by the employee decorum for us. What about them? City hall is a toxic, hostile work environment. Next. Hi, Sophia Simons. I'm rural Scott county, and I'm new to these meetings, but it seems like every week we learn something new and more disturbing than the previous week. Last week, somebody asked, where does it end? And I think the answer is, we never truly know. But the one thing we do know is that we still need to do everything we can, find out as much as we can before any further decisions are made that are going to inevitably harm the taxpayers of the city of Davenport. From what we do know, there have been numerous agreements signed and various settlements that have been paid. And we know that these have been done without going through the proper processes. We know that the auditor is investigating the city. And we know after the auditor announced investigation, we suddenly learned these two agreements existed. The secret negotiations, the backroom dealings, the convenient disclosures should have given everyone pause. But the handle of this debacle as a whole tells me and everyone else everything we need to know. I encourage you to vote no in this deal. This is not a situation that should be supported or continued. There are appropriate measures put in place to prevent this from occurring again in the future. And I just want to say that building collapsed last year on my birthday. Point of order. This is about the agreement. Ma'am. I'm sorry. All right. Well, I'm just saying the building. You're doing a great job. You've done a great job. Continuing. Speak to the agreement. Thank you. Y'all know me by now. Lacon, Dixie seven ward. Ma'am. Miss McGinnis. Madam Pro mayor.

Point of order. Point of order. Point of order. Can you give people a chance to talk? Ma'am, I am asking you to respect. I am respecting you to believe. I am asking you to speak. But you're not respecting your citizens. I'm asking you to speak. No, I am. I'm speaking for you to respect the citizens of Davenport. I speak to what's on the agenda. That's all I'm asking you. Okay. When I was shot, I curtsied to you, ma'am. Thank you. Look how addictive that is. Please sit down. Power tripping. Right? Power tripping. Judith Lee, second ward. This is about the process that's being voted on tonight as it relates to the interim city administrator. Mayor Matson issued the executive order on November 8, 2023, one day after the election, taking effect almost two weeks later, quote, appointing Mallory Merritt as interim city administrator. The executive order states that terms of Merritt's interim appointment are, quote, outlined in a letter of understanding executed by me, the mayor, on behalf of the city, and reviewed by corporation counsel. At that point, Warner. Four months later, on the advice of Lenin Waterman, the personnel MoU is offered to council tonight. Four months to ratify and cover for decisions already made using a process that is actually outside the authority of the mayor to make. You are also expected to approve an additional agreement to provide more benefits to her. An MoU is not a legally binding document. It is a non binding agreement between two or more parties for how the parties are going to work together for mutual benefit and is often a step or two before creating a binding contract. The MoU states it is meant to, quote commemorate the terms of Miss Merritt's appointment. I looked it up. Commemorate has no legal meaning. The words in the dictionary meaning is to quote, recall and show respect for something or someone or celebrate an event or person. I'm looking forward to a plaque of this MoU proudly displayed on the third floor next to the children's art. That's what commemorate means. Therefore, it appears to me, and all of this is my take on it, that what the mayor, the interim city administrator, the legal department, via their review of this MoU and Lenin Waterman are expecting you to do tonight, is to provide public cover for a secret action hidden from the public and half of council that the mayor took four months ago without council's authority, that was outside the mayor's authority to take, using a document that has no relevance to or legal enforceability on a personnel action for the most important staff job in the city. The stated purpose is to commemorate or celebrate an event or person. If you go by the definition of commemorate. To be honest, the entire situation to me is once again because it's so similar to the past situation farce and the open and clear attention to manipulate the counsel should be seen and to me is offensive.

The four chairpersons and the mayor pro tem, who unquestionably sign this ridiculous document based on a meaningless executive order, have no special authority over the other council members and you do not even consecute constitute a quorum as there was intentionally no vote. There is no tie for the mayor to break. Us council have been told not to talk about it. Those are words of an abuser, not government officials. It is time to end the secrecy. Council has no requirement to please support or cover for anyone in Davenport government by ratifying, which is an after the fact determination this MoU or approving the amendment. The city already has a lawsuit requesting nullification of the last agreements and payouts made using a similar secret process out of the public and council's eye. You are currently being investigated by the state auditor's office for those agreements. And the city is being commemorated by serious amendments to the Iowa open meeting law because Davenport's actions are seen as, quote, egregious and those of a third world government. Not my words, state legislators. Words by our state representatives. You have the opportunity, starting tonight, to start this process over and do it right. This is a really critical decision. You've already broken the hold of expected secrecy and obedience by voting not to go into executive session last week. The RFP has been for the search firm has been issued and the city scheduled to issue the contract for search firm at the end of April. As you've heard, council can now start to work together as a team to decide what they want the interim period for city administration to look like and who they believe is qualified to lead the city. You can also assure that any decision regarding the selection of a new city administrator is open, transparent and public. It is critical the process not be entirely under the mayor and the old guard on council, which is how it is currently set up. Council point of order must have been involved. There are new people involved in this. Yes, sir. Come forward. My name is Ricky First Ward. Last year, when I heard that a building collapsed in downtown Davenport on Memorial weekend, I was shocked. When I saw the briefings and chaos unfolding. I thought, this can't be real. Seems like each and every day following the claps. Sir, I'm gonna. Sir, you have to. I'm asking you to talk to speak to the agreement that we're discussing right now. That's what you need to stay focused. Okay? Thank you. I learned something new about the inner workings of Davenport City government that makes me say, this can't be real. Even louder. Stop allowing people to fail up. Stop allowing them to make decisions. For you to echo the sentiments of others, you all are going to have to put your foot down and say that enough is enough. These are your decisions to make. Neither staff nor the mayor should be exercising the authority that you have been given by the law and your constituents for you. You shouldn't be forced into agreeing to something just to cover up for something that shouldn't have happened in the first place. How is it that someone can be implicated in various scandals and failures, and then not only remain employed, but be given secret bonuses? Please take a stand. Put an end to the never ending cycle of chaos. And please vote no on these backroom deals. Thank you. Please, let's stay quiet in the chamber. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Jessica Nall's second word. And I'm just wishing, hoping that one of you guys can make it make sense to me. Why are we talking about bonuses when we have lawsuits pending. Like, really, that's the only question I have. And can. I mean, I know you guys can't tell me anything right now, but can you guys make it make sense? Nobody should be getting a bonus. Nobody. And that's not individually attacking anybody. That's anybody on this council, anybody in the city. We have homeless people that need housing. We need our roads fixed. So we're going to give somebody a $50,000 bonus, but yet we got apartments in the middle of the road. Let's be serious. Make it make sense. Jessica Schweiner, Davenport Rock island. We're here because you guys want us to be okay with the approval of giving $50,000 to somebody. My question to you, and this is based off of the generalization of work in the United States. Most jobs are acquired based on education, long term experience and merit. Can you tell me if there is any of that here? I myself have $30,000 worth of debt, 15 years of long term experience, and I still cannot make $50,000 a year on a normal payroll job, let alone a bonus. So tell me, where is there their experience? Where is there the education? Where is there the merit for this bonus to be authorized? And until you can answer that question, you should never even consider this agreement. Thank you. Ron, Twitter, Davenport Rock island. Looks like we're still status quo. Part of the old is being given a bonus for what happened. Is that bonus warranted? You know, how it was made, how it was done.

Okay, grandma. Quad cities. I just heard the resume from chick fil a to allegedly, $200,000 to add on to that. 50,000. A bonus. Because I just sit in the seat because I'm an interim. She got money. Why do we need to keep giving her more money? What is that her worth. I mean, you don't even have the skills to even be sitting here. You come from chick fil a. I'm gonna. I'm gonna ask. I'm gonna ask you. I'm gonna ask you to move forward. That's all you ever say. And I'm staying on it because I'm gonna say this, okay? And you're gonna let me say it without interrupting me.

You were voted in to take care of the constituents in Davenport, Iowa, governing Scott county. And you ain't doing that. You ain't doing that.

Y'all been very busy. I was at the. I have friends from Canada that are in town. Some I know, some I don't. But they all know about Davenport, Iowa, and not for good reasons. People in Canada and other countries know about these secret meetings and wanting to give people bonuses. It baffles me. And what am I supposed to say? Because I'm embarrassed, very embarrassed, with how this city has been run and how it is making the city look. It's bad enough that we had already in national news for 324 Main street, but now we're in the news because people are going to get bonuses and they're questioning, how has people even thought of getting bonuses when you guys have so many lawsuits? I lost count after ten. And now you're suing people because they want to know what you know, what's in the agreements. Why does people have to be gagged? Why can't they say what they know? And I am speaking about the money. Thank you very much. That has everything to do with the agreement. I don't know what I said that was wrong. But anywho, you can't pay more money to staff, employees. When you guys have all this money that you're gonna have to be dishing out to people that deserve this money. 324 main street. Tenants and families of the people that lost their life. I mean, for Chick fil A, I could have that job because I was a teacher. And I would not want a bonus. If anything, give it back to the city of Davenport, the citizens. Thank you. Anyone else? Derek Cornett, 7th ward. How y'all doing tonight? I know that's not on point, but waiting to get knocked down. I'm just here to say counsel has to stop supporting the mayor's illegal actions that he wants to take. He cannot authorize, make an executive order to do what he did. His mou. And $50,000 bonus and all that stuff. He doesn't have that authority, you know, but he's going out and doing it. And then coming back to you and say, oh, yeah, I did this. Can you sign off on it? Don't sign off on it. You don't have to. You know, if you think that's what your constituents want, go for it.

Can you sign off on it? Don't sign off on it. You don't have to. You know, if you think that's what your constituents want, go for it. But I don't think they want that. You know, and I think that the young lady's right. We are looking like a fool to the nation. You know, it's like, whatever. What's happening in Davenport today? Which city employee is jumping ship? Which one's under indictment, which one's going to jail, you know, what are we doing? I know nobody is going to jail. Nobody is indicted. So let's. Not yet. Please do. Not yet. Do you want to sit down? Do you want to sit down? Yeah, I can sit down. Well, I will allow you to continue talking if you will talk to the agreement and not talk about people being under indictment. Okay. Well, the next thing I want to say is when Mallory, Miss Merritt was giving the financial statement this year on our budget and everything. Nice presentation, you know, but we had at least three slush ones that we had. It was like one with $20,000,000.01 with $3 million, almost 3 million. Another one, I don't know what it had in it. I don't know how you balance those in a budget. Where does the slush fund money go? How do you get a line item on that? You know, what special little category do you put that in? Slush funds are already pretty much illegal because usually they fund illegal acts. You know, slush funds shouldn't be what we're calling them anyhow, but that's what we call them. So I don't know if we the person that's doing it, doing our financials, calls it a slush fund. We do not. I'm gonna. You can sit down. We do not have slush funds. We don't. We don't have. She said we did. She said we did. We have three of them. I think you're done. Mister Cornett. Mister Cornette, sir, please come forward. Patrick Peacock, Rock Island County, Illinois, resident, former seven ward alderman here in the city of Davenport. I took the time out of my schedule to come back here, not only for this session, but your previous session, to make sure I can address this particular item correctly. And I believe I have enough information to speak to the subject. And when I sat there as an alderman, I gave this council some good words, but I know it fell some deaf ears. I said, if you want to know about a city, look at its budget and the things they are appropriate. Today we are looking at bonuses, if I'm not mistaken, for this particular office, bonuses. Not only are you have a slew lawsuits council, not only do you have infrastructure, I know they're different color for money, but infrastructure has fallen. And I told you when I sat on that council, the appearance, the appearance make you complicit because you're not doing the right thing. I know there's new members on this council, but there are some old ones on this council, and I'm not going to use those derogatory terms. A lot of people talk about the old guard, but I would tell you as someone who sat on this council, this is deplorable. Deplorable to the measures before us. We're talking about a bonus. In corporate America, there's evaluations. I was privy to some evaluations. It's called 360 assessment. How can you have an evaluation of a superior and the information goes back to that superior? Is that truly an evaluation? The answer is no. So what basis are you giving this bonus to? Just for the person getting the new term of office? Mmm. That's kind of a hard thing to swallow, counsel. Very hard thing to swallow. So what would you tell somebody who's new to this thing on why you're giving these bonuses out? Just because you have to. My question for the council, what due diligence have you done as the council? When staff give you the paperwork, do you actually look at it? Do you actually read it? Do you ask probing questions? Do you kick it back to them, say, I need some more information. I know half of you don't. I know half of you don't. How many times have you actually approached staff about something that's before you, but right before you about bonuses. I will ask you, have you ever looked at the task at hand for this young individual? Can they serve two different roles? Actually, you've done it before. You've done it before. And I ask you to not only look at this role and see if this person can do serve two roles. Is that person certified to do two roles? Are they qualified to do two roles? And what appearance does that look like? What appearance does that look like? As I say out in that city council, we talk about the budget you about to give $50,000 to. Well, maybe two individuals, but you have a whole division that's underfunded. Underfunded? Tell me, how is that possible? This city has gone to hell in a handbasket, and I'm glad I'm not on the council. Thank you. Thank you. Latrice Lacey, Pip Ward. I would like to echo the statement made earlier. If this is passed, I too will be amending my existing equal pay complaint to add this to it. I am just stunned that we have an actual discussion about giving someone a $50,000 bonus. We all are aware has been involved in all of the dealings and the controversy that has caused the investigations. We have an agreement that's been signed outside of the public, and the people who we are considering giving bonuses to should know that that is not the way that that's done. They should know that you have to go through the public process. That's a part of the job that we're considering a bonus for, is knowing that the same people were involved in doing a salary study. They illegally amended my job description, which is completely under the commission to do, gave that to the company that they outsourced, again, another part of their job in figuring out compensation bans. Presumably that's something that some of these high salaried people should be capable of doing, but instead we're outsourcing it to a third party. And I am the lowest classified director.

I have to do our HR stuff. I have to do our finance stuff. I have to do our it stuff, and I'm paid less than everyone. And we certainly don't have funding to give bonuses to anybody. So we work 60, 70, 80 hours a week and don't even get paid anywhere near what these people are getting paid. And we certainly don't get bonuses. We've asked for additional funding every year. We're told it's not in the budget, but somehow we have $50,000 that we can give out. This is a waste of money. It's a slap in the face, and it's discriminatory. Thank you. Thank you. Seeing no one else. Would an alderman please move the resolution? We have a motion and a second. And Alderman Reinhart. Thank you. I will be offering a motion to table this agenda item for two cycles after, and I want to make sure my colleagues have an opportunity to speak. So I turn the floor over to my colleagues, and then if you bring it back to me, I will make the motion. Yes. Yes, Armando. Alderman Jovgen, thank you. If I was going to talk last Friday, my words probably would have been a little different than they are tonight. I want to thank some of my colleagues for having some conversations throughout the weekend. And earlier this week changed a little bit my perspective just for the public, you know, I will be supportive of a table tonight. We'll vote, vote yes to that. And so I do thank my colleagues for introducing and doing that. I look forward to having some discussion with that as we talk about when we're going to do this. Food for thought from my colleagues next Saturday, 23rd. We do have special session to talk about modern Woodman park stuff. Maybe we pack a lunch and just make it a day. So just, just noodle on that a little bit. Now to a couple other things, right? I'm a physical therapist. Went to school, got a job right out of PT school. Within six years, was promoted to area therapy director for concentra. Outside of, you know, a quarter. Get me a cup and that. Get me a cup of coffee at Hy Vee. What does that mean? Well, my, my previous job experience before that was a bagger at Joe Van's grocery store, which is no longer in existence. So, you know, hey, I hear you public, but, you know, man, sometimes we miss the mark on a couple of our arguments, so just, just want to throw that out there when we talk about if people could be. I'm hearing people. Please do due diligence. Sorry, sorry, mayor. Ms. Mayor. Protest. Look at city of Rock island recently. Their parks director was named interim city administrator, city manager. Look up what they paid that person. Look how they restructured some of their organizations. Granted, they got a little different time going on. Look at city of Webster City, Iowa, town of 8000 people, they've recently hired an interim city manager. Look at what they're paying that person. It's about one hundred sixty k a year plus other benefits. So as people are wanting us to be stewards of taxpayer dollars, right. The position of city administrator needs to be filled on an interim basis. Right. Someone's got to do that job. And I hate to tell you, we're going to have to pay for it. So if you're scoffing at 50, please don't come back and talk to us about what's probably going to be a lot more if we got to go outside. So just think about that and yep, doing some research there. Now, if we want to get in semantics of bonus or whatever, I will say again, the job's gotta be done. I will give kudos to Miss Merritt for the job she has done to this point. Right. As a city council member, I've gotten more communication in the last few months than I have in the past. And again, I thank her for the job doing that. I'm gonna be very careful. Try not to step over toes and those types of things tonight, but again, just for the public, we got to be careful what we wish for in a way. All right. Because the permanent city administrator position is going to take a long time to fill. Gonna take a long time to fill. Right. We gotta get our ducks in a row. We gotta get our stuff straight. And for any viable candidate to come in here anytime soon, you know, we gotta realize that that's not gonna happen. So, again, if you're arguing about $50,000 right now, just know that that ticket's gonna be a lot more if we go outside. That's just my thoughts for tonight. Thank you, Alderman Newton. Thank you, Madame Pro Tem. Two comments on this matter. The first, at the beginning of this matter, there was a statement read in regards to the executive session last week being requested by the employees.

All right. Because the permanent city administrator position is going to take a long time to fill. Gonna take a long time to fill. Right. We gotta get our ducks in a row. We gotta get our stuff straight. And for any viable candidate to come in here anytime soon, you know, we gotta realize that that's not gonna happen. So, again, if you're arguing about $50,000 right now, just know that that ticket's gonna be a lot more if we go outside. That's just my thoughts for tonight. Thank you, Alderman Newton. Thank you, Madame Pro Tem. Two comments on this matter. The first, at the beginning of this matter, there was a statement read in regards to the executive session last week being requested by the employees. I would request copy of such written correspondence to be provided to me and to the council. Second, the council has had an opportunity to hear from the people today. We heard from the people last week. Some of us hear from the people via email and phone calls. I understand that there's a lot of information that's still needed at this time. I do think that this matter should be tabled for a minimum of two cycles to allow the council time to thoroughly research and vet all the information. I want to thank those on council that picked up the phone and spoke to me since last week and heard from my perspective, in regards to taking a step back in order to be able to move forward. And then lastly, to the people, I hear you. This has not fallen on deaf ears. The council is listening. The council is paying attention, and we want to do what is best for the city of Davenport. We understand we have a lot of work to do. Essentially, our work is cut out for us. This has been the longest two months and 13 days of my life. But I am listening. I am confident that my colleagues on council are listening and that we want to do what is right. So bear with us. And I certainly encourage my colleagues to vote to table this. Alderman Kelly, thank you very much. So let me start with. We don't have any ill will for people and their successes, so I'm gonna have to say this to my colleagues. How many people of color graduate from college and get on the job training? Just saying, statistically, and, you know, no disrespect to you, Mallory, I've called you personally, but I'm just saying, how many people do you know statistically, not just black, blacks, Mexicans, asian, anybody on the job training and go through all the promotions and things that these folks have done at the city of Davenport? So if I had to make a comment the other day saying I turned my phone off at midnight. Jasmine. I mean, Ottoman Newton, you know, I love. I'm listening. We all listening. But I'm just saying it's tiring. When there it was a position of, like. It was like a chokehold. And now that I feel like I am not in a chokehold anymore, as an alderman, I'm much more verbal. But I won't. I don't want to say something out of pocket, but I had a knee on my neck for almost two years. It felt like. And you guys know what? I'm still living with this ridiculous lawsuit that the city never stepped up to assist me with, let me put that on the record, that I'm still doing that all by myself. You know what I'm saying? So with that being said, we're listening. This is tough. This is tough. Because the interesting piece is the mayor's not here to defend why he did or said what he did. You know what I'm saying? There's been two weeks of executive and meetings, and let's hear your version. Because I sat on that council and I knew nothing. And I'm happy about that. That I was in a position where I didn't know. So when any. And everybody comes to me, that's the answer you're gonna get I'm gonna throw my hands up. Cause I don't know nothing. But I'm listening. And like I said, when you know better, you do better. Thank you. I had a couple of comments. I, too, support this table. I would. I feel that one thing that was said tonight is a bit misleading in terms of. Miss Merritt's call is somebody's phone. Can we. Is it the script? Mallory. Oh, Mallory. I'd like to speak when you're done. Okay. I believe, Miss Mallory, you have considerable education, and I'm not asking for your resume tonight, but would you tell us your educational background so that we don't have this huge leap that somehow happened tonight? Sure I can. I have an undergraduate degree from Barrie College in government and a master's in public administration from Auburn. Thank you very much. May I go to Alderman? Okay. Thank you, Alderman Grimm. Thank you, Alderwoman McGuinness. So I started taking notes of a lot of what I would call our half truths, whole lies and misinformation that we were hearing from the public with common tonight. I thought about going line by line and refuting some of those items, but sadly, I don't think that it is going to do any good. What is particularly frustrating is the continued misinformation being spread by former council people who all left under a cloud of their own controversy. But continue. Alderman grip. Alderman. Alderman grip. Please go. There is one. There is. Hey. There is one thing that was said enough times tonight that I am going to address it. And that is the assertion that Miss Merritt isn't qualified for the job of interim city administrator. She is absolutely qualified. She has the education. She has the accreditations. She has a very strong resume within the city of Davenport that's over a decade long. She has a strong record with Davenport. Quite frankly, if she wanted to leave Davenport and go be a city administrator in another city, she would be the top candidate in a lot of searches.

I'm going to support it. Appreciate the conversations I've had with some of my colleagues, but want to make sure that when we're speaking, we're speaking truth and facts. And just because you say something loudly or repeat it enough doesn't make it true. Thank you for the time. Alder Roman lynch. Thank you. I just briefly want to touch base and thank my colleagues, my fellow council members for being so receptive and open to open dialogue and conversation. Since I have been here, I have called on each one of you and every time I have met with open arms. So with that being said, I do want to stress that we are, I think, a very unique council and we are communicating with each other. And we all, I feel, want what's best for the city of Davenport wholeheartedly, even if we agree to disagree. So I do just want to take the moment to thank you and I look forward to our continued conversations. I don't see any. So I will come back to Alderman Reinhart. Alderman Reinhart, thank you. I'd like to make one last comment too. We've listened to you and by tabling this and going through cycles, we will all have an opportunity to sit and review past as well as future goals and objectives. It's important that we get the next step correct for the city as well as it is for the constituents. So we're taking this step backwards to give it time for all of us to reflect on what our next step needs to be. With that being said, I want to thank my colleagues. I also want to thank misses Merritt. She's done a wonderful job since I've been here. I only have a brief two and a half months, but she's been. Whenever I needed something and a piece of advice, she was there. So you get my kudos as well. With that being said, I'd like to thank my colleagues and I will now make the motion to table this item for two cycles. Second. We have a motion and a second, typically in our guidelines, a voice vote. But this is an important discussion and so I'm going to ask for a roll call vote, please. Reinartz. Yes. Newton. Yes. McInnes. Yes. T. Dunn. Yes. Lynch. Yes. Ardon. Yes. Grip. Yes. Kelly. Yes. Berkholder. Yes. And Jobgen. Yes. Ten. Yes. This is mayor pro tem. So that motion has passed and this will be put on. This will be table for two cycles. That would bring us back April 3. This will come back to council should be April 3. So the next item on the agenda is a resolution ratifying Executive Order 20240. One, appointing Brian Heyer as interim corporate counsel and approving the personnel memorandum of understanding between the city of Davenport and Bryan Heyer memorializing Mister Hyer's appointment as interim corporate counsel. Is there any public with comment? You have five minutes. Please come to the podium. Patrick Peacock, Rock Island county former seven world alderman. I will make this remark very brief and to the point. Very similar to the last one. The budget is very sensitive, very time sensitive. But this one here is particularly because we talk about corporate counsel. I don't care what type of antidotes you can throw on it. Corporate counsel is very important because that's how you are being represented. But how many older persons actually looked at the legal task? Or how many people have actually looked at the order and structure of what the legal department actually does or that individual would do? Somebody already mentioned it because I'm very privy to information. A lot of that task is outsourced, but this person is going to receive a bonus outsource. So somebody who's not here talk about qualifications. But particularly, I have a problem because every time there's somebody, probably, it seems like the goalpost always moves for certain individuals. Somebody says person is qualified, okay? But there's a person in this room that has a law degree of ten years of service that contact conversations don't come up. The question is why? Hmm. A law degree versus a master's degree. And ten years with the service, ten years with the city. And when I sat on that council and I advocated for a certain department, that never came up. No, that's Pat Peacock. He's just being Pat Peacock. An alderman just said, this person's qualified because they have a master's degree and they have longevity with the city. Am I speaking to a topic? It's right on top. I think we're talking about. Thank you. It is about exactly what it is. Okay. Thank you so very much. Thank you. But question is, why is that? Why is that there's differences for two people? I'm just. I'm posing great questions because I want the senior counselor to understand the appearance of what this council is doing. I sat on that counselor, told you many, many times, what you do in the dark shall come to light eventually. I promise you that. Thank you. My name is David Ezrin Sidron. I live in the third ward.

On February 7, 2024, the state auditor of Iowa sent this document addressed to the city of Davenport, care of Mister Hyer. This document reads in part, we, the state auditor of Iowa, are conducting an investigation of certain transactions processed by the City of Davenport. I have it on good authority that Mister Heyer neglected to tell you the city council of Davenport that you were being investigated. I also have it on good authority that Mister Heyer neglected to tell the city council that the city sued the state auditor to try to quash the subpoena, or that the city was suing me to try to hide the same document. I am now going to ask you a question that you don't know the answer to. What is Mister Hyers relationship to the city? Whatever you think the answer is, I assure you, you are wrong. This document, signed by Mister Heyer on August 2, 2022, is a voluntary separation agreement. Mister Hyer's official last day of work for the City of Davenport, according to this document, was February 2, 2024. But then there is this document. These documents were uncovered in the lawsuit filed by the city against the state auditor in the minutes of a city council executive session on December 6, 2023. Mister Hyer is listed as interim corporation council. But that's impossible. Because according to this document, Mister Tom Warner was corporation counsel on that date until his resignation on January 2, 2024. But that can't be right either. Because according to this document, Mister Heyer wasn't made interim city attorney until January 2, 2024. And that was by executive order, which we already know the mayor doesn't have the power to do. So. What does Mister Hyer do for the city? How much is Mister Hyer paid by the city? And why does Mister Hyer deserve another $50,000 bonus? It appears that Mister Hyer's primary function is to hide important information from the city council. Since he has done that for months. Let that sink in. He has been hiding important information. I call a point of order. What point of order? I am calling a point of order. I know that Mister Hyer is working on many things connected to the city in terms of legal issues. It has not been hidden. It has certainly not been hidden from me and others. So I. Did you just say that you knew that the city was subpoenaed? Did you know that? Did you know that? Because I certainly know that the information was hidden by Mister Hayer from members of this council. I know that for a fact. Now you're saying it wasn't hidden from you, but it was hidden from others. Interesting. It was public knowledge that the city was being sued. I'm not going to get into a debate with you. It was public knowledge that the city was being investigated. So move on, please. Move on. Move on. What is Mister Hyer pay? Again, nobody has an answer. Nobody knows his job title or his pay at this point. Lastly, why should Mister Hyer receive a 50,000 bonus? He shouldn't. It's obvious. Mister Hyer should no longer be employed by the city. He already signed the separation agreement. I strongly urge the city council to accept this agreement, which was signed and dated and notarized. It's over. It's done. He's out of here. Please send Mister Hyer away now. Thank you. I'm asking everyone to stay silent. Yes, sir. Cody. Hila. I again just want to say that I'll be filing an equal pay claim if this passes. I do three jobs. I don't ask for $50,000. I'm doing it all, like, today. I don't want to be here right now. I just came from processing 60 fair housing cases in our office. I do it every day, people. You can look at some of our cases. EEOC versus los agaves is a case that I investigated. I had to interview sexual assault victims being assaulted at work, and then I have to go do other cases like that. So it's a traumatic job, but then to do this in other jobs without being compensated or asking for it and then to have this come up is a slap in the face, and it's discrimination. And I will be filing that claim. And I want to say, what's the point of having assistant city administrators if they're going to get paid for duties as a new position? There's no point. Thank you. Judith Lee, second ward. First of all, I stand by everything I said previously. Two, I disagree with you because I think you're not taking a step backwards. Counsel is taking a step forward in tabling this, and I'm hoping that you also table this one as well. The process is the same as what I talked about with Miss lynch, appointed by the mayor by executive order the day after you folks took office. The MOU said it was executed by me, the mayor, and, quote, reviewed by interim city administrator CFO Mallory Merritt. Again, the MoU is not a binding contract, and it commemorates nothing the process used was secretive out of the public and council's view. Maybe not all of you, but most of you.

There's no point. Thank you. Judith Lee, second ward. First of all, I stand by everything I said previously. Two, I disagree with you because I think you're not taking a step backwards. Counsel is taking a step forward in tabling this, and I'm hoping that you also table this one as well. The process is the same as what I talked about with Miss lynch, appointed by the mayor by executive order the day after you folks took office. The MOU said it was executed by me, the mayor, and, quote, reviewed by interim city administrator CFO Mallory Merritt. Again, the MoU is not a binding contract, and it commemorates nothing the process used was secretive out of the public and council's view. Maybe not all of you, but most of you. With the MoU intended to be signed solely by the mayor, Mallory Merritt and Brian Heyer. This time you folks were left out where you were included as the chair last time. Apparently no one ever got around to making any kind of agreement with Mister Hyer, and he's been operating as interim corporate counsel since. The previous one was told by Lenan Waterman to pack up his stuff and go home before January 2. And at least since, as was said earlier, December 6, he was documented as being the interim corporate counsel. What is going on? Counsel has the opportunity to ensure that our legal department, as led by new corporation counseling. Hopefully someone outside of Davenport that comes in new, is honest, open, provides clear and accurate legal device when requested, does not hide things from anybody, and does not file crazy lawsuits fighting entities that try to bring city government actions into council point of order. For example, the February 18 request by Thorndike and Torres. This is public information. Public information filed with the courts. They asked for intervener status. In the city's lawsuit against Doctor Sidren, it states that the city, quote, solicited humiliating details of their lives and those letters would be treated as confidential and not released to the public, which of course, you now know they were. The city has responded, this is in the court. This is public, by calling them, quote, interlopers and basically told them to pound sand. Does this explain why their original demand letters were not on attorney letterhead? Did our legal department solicit and manage the entire process on all sides? Is it then really surprising the city's attempting to withhold Spiegel's demand letter? It's no wonder that lane and Waterman, on behalf of Davenport, has sued the honor's office to avoid releasing the recordings of the executive sessions that are under the subpoena. That's what they're looking for. Whose idea was it to advise the mayor that he had the authority to issue the executive order that he had no authority to do, and the Mous as a way to do employment? Who advised him of that? Whose legal idea was it to allow, in violation of council resolution from 2015 and longstanding tradition, to shorten the amount of time for public with business excluded entirely from committee, the whole and not to record and archive all meetings gavel to gavel, including such public comments? Who gave Mister Heyer the authority to treat our aldermen at large with great disrespect when she raised a question that has public interest and questioning the violation of that council resolution and to publicly conduct great dereliction of duty when he publicly refused to answer her question? Why did we wait until now to issue an RFP for a search firm when we knew on August 2, 2022, that Warner signed that he was leaving January 2 and higher sign that he was leaving February 2, 2024? I know we hired a lawyer that subsequently died, but I was told third or fourth hand, because like alderman Kelly, I was not in the loop and I was explicitly kept out of the loop, that this was for filling the assistant attorney, not the corporation counsel. And why didn't we continue the search for the attorney then? We needed them then. What was the underlying plan? Why is hire still here? Being commemorated as recorded in WQAD story from November 2024, 2014. Tom Warner stated that the number of lawsuits against the city would be lower without a heavy concentration of a local attorney's client filing so many complaints against the city. The attorney replied he was just doing his job. Thank you, Miss Lee. Diane Salmon, 8th Ward. I have no ill will towards anybody, but this stupidity has got to stop. You guys are wasting our taxpayer dollars. You're taking money from our children. You're leaving people high and dry. This is America. We have freedom of speech. We can come in here and speak. And for you guys to point of order, people, and to sit there and act like we don't know how to stay on topic is ridiculous. It takes time to get there. When you people have your time to share, you guys sometimes rabbit hole, but you're allowed to do it. So give us a break. We are trying. We are very passionate. We love our city. And some of you have clearly made up your minds that you want to do this for them, and that's fine. But just remember, if you go against what the people want, you lose the people's trust. And guess who elects you next time you come around. Thank you, chair Oshanga. Third word. And I do want to say I appreciate the diversity on the city council. It's nice to see that what wasn't so nice to see is the way the women are treated on the city council by either the mayor or corporate council. I was very disappointed at the way the alder woman to my left was shut down by the mayor the last week of February at that council meeting. Even more disappointed when Alderman Newton was completely shut down by counsel. Mister Heyer, two weeks ago, I've heard the word bully used a lot. I saw that. I saw intimidation used.

Please listen and look and see what's going on daily. How the law. How. Who is it that Rob sand. You don't want Rob sand to do an audit because you got something to hide about what you're doing.

No, you ain't. No, you ain't. He don't really like you. Trust me. What it is, is he like how you go roll with him to make a fool out of the people in Davenport, Iowa. Guys gotta stop following him.

Guys, I saw you do it last week. I saw you. But you're only doing it like I said, just to be on his side. And he don't even like y'all. And this man here, he don't even like women. Cause if he liked it, women, he would not talk down to women the way he do. Ask yourself, does he treat his wife like that? Or do he even have a wife? I know. I'm sticking to it. I'm sticking to it. I am. I'm sticking to it. Okay? I'm sticking to it. Thank you. Stop messing with my five minutes. But is he gonna take that 50,000, give it to a woman? Guys, do not vote to give him or her 50,000. Don't do it. Don't do it. Cause like I said, I've been knowing the mayor probably longer than some of y'all. I worked on his campaign to get him in this seat. I thought he was going to be a good guy. I really did. I bagged him. I'm president of a union. I bagged him big time. Only to see the corruption that's going on here by him. Vote no. Thank you. Sorry. Miss Burke. Lashona Dixon, seven ward.

I just want to make it very clear is that it's not definitely all the credentials that people hold that should make them be able to be eligible for abilities.

I don't get to walk into a law firm and just get a job. Why? The same way why we're saying this about these individuals. I don't want to get point of order, so I'm trying to tread lightly. Cause you've done it all night. The left hand has to tell the right hand what is going on. Vice versa. Whatever one you like to choose. Because people get up here and they swear they know what's going on. But then you have two people that say they did not. So obviously, there's a group of people that have no clue what's going on, and I'm going somewhere with this, so don't point to order me. We all have to be on the same page.

I don't get to walk into a law firm and just get a job. Why? The same way why we're saying this about these individuals. I don't want to get point of order, so I'm trying to tread lightly. Cause you've done it all night. The left hand has to tell the right hand what is going on. Vice versa. Whatever one you like to choose. Because people get up here and they swear they know what's going on. But then you have two people that say they did not. So obviously, there's a group of people that have no clue what's going on, and I'm going somewhere with this, so don't point to order me. We all have to be on the same page. We cannot let one man that wears pants for a six foot person and walks around here like he looks great, make all decisions for everybody when his hems are six inches too long. We have to make it stop. They know what I'm talking about, so don't stop me. We have to go ahead and work together. I ask you not to do so please go for it. What do I do? Whatever. Personal attack. Yes. Oh, okay. Thank you. You should have just said that. I said it, though. Okay? Please, you have to let it just goes along. What else you want to say? Mister Krupp, hold the time. So please go forward. No personal attacks. It's very clear what you were saying. And don't do it. Please don't. I don't want to. I don't want to gather you down. Please. But you've done it to everybody else. Nope. He's holding your time. All right. Okay. Are you done? Yes, I am. Are you ready to go? Okay. All right, mister Propp, go ahead and start the time. And speaking on power chips, this is exactly what this man is doing. That's what I was saying. We cannot let him have all the power that he thinks he's doing. It is fair for us to ask, why do they deserve this money? We're not. Wait. We're not here just to waste your time. We want to know, based on what has happened in the past, what they've done here, not only their credentials or their education, what have they done in the past? How have they failed us in the past? Everything that has happened has not been good. So what we're saying is, why can't we get new people? We cannot just continue to pay off money for somebody else to do a job that he's being paid for. I think that's fair to say. I don't know if y'all guys are just missing what we're saying. Cause you're so tied up in everything else. We're saying just to irritate and agitate you some more. Cause we can. We're just asking you to be fair to us, citizens of Davenport, to be fair with our money. Because we've already put out 6 million. We only had ten, so that means we're going to be broke if we keep this up. Unless there's another account, though, you know, we don't know about. I'm just saying, y'all let me get up out of y'all way before I get point of order again, because obviously we must be touching on some type of truth because every time somebody says something, you get upset. So we're touching on something. Hi, my name is Gary ekland, and I live in alderman Kelly's ward, and I'm going to ask to please not interrupt me. I have an opinion that since I started coming down here, frequently I am interrupted because the people interrupting me do not like what I'm saying, and not because I'm violating any rules. My contacts with this man have been personal and face to face for approximately three years. Almost three years. And these are my personal face to face interactions with this man. Except I am going to say before I do that, that I was astounded to hear that three alderpeople were put by the legal department on a do not communicate with list, which is, to me, a partisan political act by the legal department. And I was even more astounded if it's. If I understood correctly, and maybe I didn't, but if I understood correctly, there are department head meetings, and there are 14 department heads, 13 of which appear to be white, and one appears not to be white. And I thought I heard that the legal department put the. I do not want to interrupt you, but please, we are talking about an agreement with. Are you Ryan hire? This is what my time. Please. This is what we're. This is what we're talking about. Stay focused on that, please. Stay focused on the agreement with Mister Hyer. I do not want to interrupt you. I want you to have your time. Thank you. Okay, but you have to stay focused there, sir. Thank you. It's hard to focus when you're interrupted, but I will try here. My point with that is that if I understood correctly, the legal department told the black department head that she could not attend the department head meetings. And if that's correct, if I understood that correctly, that's outrageous. It's like using the n word in city hall, which is outrageous. This man, as you will find out, has cost the city millions of dollars personally, and he is going to cost the city millions of dollars more. I finally got around to being able to sign the first of multiple investigations into the city on my behalf that are going to cost the city millions of dollars. And he could have stopped them in 2021 by behaving properly as a legal representative of the city. I handed him documents, letters to the mayor, letters to the human resources director, letters to the city administrator, outlining my allegations of on the job racial and ethnic hatred and discrimination by code enforcement officers in the city of Davenport, Iowa. That should have prompted an investigation by the human resources Department and by the legal department that would have put an end to such conduct that I am alleging led to a December 7 hate crime against me. 2022 and the July 6.

On December 7 of 2022, on his authorization, the city staff showed up at my house at 07:00 a.m. they destroyed native american religious art. The head of the neighborhood department, acting on his authorization, was in my yard. The head of the neighborhood department said if I allowed him to do a plant by plant inspection of my yard, nothing would be destroyed. He then ordered the destruction of native american religious art. That would not have happened. There's a legal concept. I'm not a lawyer, but they say if not for or. But for the actions of this person, but for the actions of this man, would this have occurred? And but for the actions of this man, the destruction of my native american religious art on December 7, 2022, would not have occurred. That man is personally and legally responsible. I am attempting to press federal charges, and you know that going forward and jumping to July 6, 2023, they came to my yard. I'm told by city staff, who are supposed to be protected from retaliation, that they pulled legally required documents that should have came in the mail to me that would have allowed me to appeal this and also would have given me warning so that when they came in July, it was on July 6. On July 6, while the city staff was destroying my plants, and, excuse me, on July 6, when the city went around my yard destroying. I had hundreds of these. And now I have one. He. The agreement should be turned down completely, and he should be terminated immediately because he authorized declaring plants illegal in my yard. And they destroyed hundreds of these, saying that it was illegal for me to have plants in my yard. He authorized it. He should be prosecuted. Dave before I completely run out of time, David Whitaker. I left Mother Mary. I had a nativity scene that I inherited from a man named David Whitaker when he died. He died slowly over three years of pancreatic cancer. And I helped him shop for groceries and all of that. I'm not a saint. I just helped him. And he died slowly of pancreatic cancer. And when he died, I inherited a manger scene and unfortunately left Mother Mary over there. But I called him while city staff. A couple of pieces survived because they were hidden away and they didn't see. So here's a wise man. A mother Mary survived, but I had a baby Jesus and a manger scene on a table, and he authorized their destruction. There was a city staff member somewhere who picked up baby Jesus and put it in the garbage truck, and he is responsible. Thank you, sir. That's a crime. Thank you, sir. Brian Sweder, Rock Island, Davenport. Why do we continue to reward the past and what it's cost the city? We're talking about a person involved in some of the aspects of what is trouble in the city now. And we're talking about giving $50,000. Wow. It doesn't make sense that we continue to reward the bad past we've had, the questionable past we've had, had. And now with all the pending litigation, lawsuits. Wow. You know, when we have a state representative and state officials questioning, we've become the laughingstock of a country, and now we sue not to release documents. A lot of transparency there, ain't there? Wow. I'm almost ashamed. Some days someone says you're from Davenport. Hmm. But to reward the past and continue the behavior that has gone on shouldn't be rewarded. I asked his counsel to turn this illegal or, excuse me, questionable resolution. So please vote no. Thank you. Thank you. Jessica Schwaner, Davenport Rock island on my earlier statement, when I said that education, long term experience and merit are what most people in this country have to have to have a decent job. To reiterate on that, it's not just one thing, it's all of them combined. We now have allegations of misdeeds for bad advice given to this council. Me personally, that bad advice is when you is based on how it affects me, is the first Amendment right. That is a God given right given to us. And when we have a lawyer that advises against that, in my mind, that's not right. That don't work. And you should not reward someone to tell the people that they do not have the rights that they are given by God, by our constitution and by our bill of rights. So how can you sit here and ask us to approve giving this person more money when he can't even advise you properly on one of the most important, fundamental things of our lives? And to reiterate to your comment earlier of saying that people don't want to pay or you didn't use those words, but people don't want to pay out money, but we're going to have to pay out money. Yes, we want to pay out money, but only to people who are qualified to do the job, not to someone who just walks in, not to someone who doesn't have the long term experience to know what they need to do. We don't mind paying for it, but we're not going to pay for something that is not worth being paid for. So to say that we don't want to pay for it, that's just wrong.

I'm from the moon. At this point, summit ward. Um, I don't know how you are gonna sit up here and approve a bonus for someone that publicly disrespected someone that you sit next to. Not just one of you, but two of you. I'm sorry, but if I was up there and he disrespected my friend up there, that'd be a quick no to a bonus to me. Y'all supposed to be a team. So when he disrespected one of y'all, he disrespected the team. That's what kind of person I am. I roll my teammates. That's my team. You roll no matter what. But we know some of y'all is the mayor's teammate. We got two different teams going on here. You got your friend that works on vacation. It's just so convenient. He is not here. Where is he? Not even on the phone. Mayor, are you on the phone? Because he don't care. He the one who caused all this trouble. He the one who promised the bonus. And he not even here to tell y'all why or to defend why he even did it. I don't know what sense that makes. He done got y'all in a whole bunch of trouble, and then he probably at home eating dinner in front of the tv, and y'all still here dealing with us, which. Thank you. I appreciate you. I want to say this, too. I am more than happy to have my tax dollars go to a new person, because I think that we need a new, healthy set of eyes on the city of Davenport. The sea healthy, clear, 2020 vision. I don't care if they got glasses or not. We need some healthy, new eyes on this situation, because I'm tired of living in a city where I am embarrassed every other week we're in a newspaper. Every other day, we on the news for stupid stuff, and then we hear about bullying. That was bullying we witnessed. To me, that was a form of bullying. So now when I hear people say they're being bullied and city council, not only do we. Did we hear it from somebody, but we also seen it as well. We need to have a healthy city council and administrators, whatever they are, that deserve a $50,000 bonus. Can I get one, too? Who wants $50,000? Can we get some, too? Cause I think we sat in these seats long enough complaining. I think we should get a little bonus, too, because we've been bringing you our concerns for so long. But y'all don't even listen to us. Y'all act like we don't know what we talking about. And we have a college professor. Y'all treat him so bad. Can he get a bonus? I'll gladly give him mine. And for you guys to sit here and not acknowledge the civil rights people that have been complaining and need a raise, too, will y'all share your bonuses with them? Make it make sense. Make it make sense because it's common sense. Or maybe it's just the common sense that I was raised, that some of us was raised out here, that it makes sense, but what does not make sense is giving a bonus to someone who disrespects people that we have seen disrespect. He has not disrespected me, but what we seen was disrespectful. Bonuses are for people that deserve them. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. I didn't expect to come up and speak again this week, so I'm going off the top of my head. So excuse me for this one thing I want to point out before I forget. We're discussing these bonuses as if these people are not already being paid and being paid well. It's being discussed like the $50,000 is the only thing that they're getting. No, they have a salary already. And as the second in charge, you're already supposed to be there to step up to perform those duties when the person who's in charge isn't there. So as the assistant city administrator, aren't you supposed to step up when the city administrator isn't there? That's the purpose of having an assistant city administrator. The difference between the current salary and the starting salary for the city administrator is. What is it, a 55? Ma'am, we're talking about the agreement with. I understand that. I'll get worried. I'll get to it. Thank you. We're talking about this as if we're coming from scratch. And that's not where we are. To everyone else's point about rewarding bad behavior. I grew up around a lot of country old men and they say the catch and come before the hanging. That is the motto of our legal department. It's easy for you all to think that we are all insane because you don't know half of the stuff that they do.

I grew up around a lot of country old men and they say the catch and come before the hanging. That is the motto of our legal department. It's easy for you all to think that we are all insane because you don't know half of the stuff that they do. Because as Mister St. John pointed out, you don't get a lot of the information. You're getting what they want to tell you about. As the elected officials, you should be pissed that the information that is intended for you is being funneled through them. And they're going to decide what information they're going to give you. Even when it's information that is addressed to you that affects you personally. They don't get to make that decision for you. There have been so many instances of things that are inappropriate and who knows what council is being told about them. We don't know. And it creates this adversarial relationship between the council, between members of the public, between other staff. Because the city of Davenport is a hostile and toxic working environment and it operates like the high school and mean girls. If you were to ask staff who's been personally victimized by Regina George, you'd be surprised at how many people would raise their hands. It does not make sense that we are even here having this conversation about a deal that was negotiated outside of the public at the advice of counsel. And no one is realizing the irony of the council gave you bad advice decided outside of the public, and then now you're having to redo it after paying someone else to give you independent legal advice. Because the legal advice that you have internally isn't good enough. Maybe give the bonus to outside counsel. They seem to be doing a better job than the people that were paying for it. Today I got an acceptance order for the Public Information board because Mister Hyer denied a request for records from the commission. Did you all know about it? He knows what open records laws say. He knows that he can't refuse to fulfill an open records request, but he does it because who cares? Nothing's going to happen. I can do what I want. And I have endless resources that finance is going to approve, to pay for legal fees, to defend the actions that I've undertaken because it never comes back to counsel. You all are the client, the public is the client. How do you make decisions on behalf of the client without discussing it with the client? How can the legal department decide it's going to sue a private citizen for FOIA records and not even tell counsel how? You all are going to be the one publicly held accountable for it, but you don't even get the courtesy of knowing about it? Not only am I making the decision for you, I'm not even going to tell you I'm making the decision. You'll find out when it hits the newspaper. That's ridiculous. But for whatever reason, this is seen as acceptable here. It doesn't make sense. The literal reason for my EEOC complaint is the behavior of these people. And we're talking about giving them a bonus. They won't even pay wages that are authorized to staff, but they are willing to get their own $50,000 bonus. How? Who is running the city? We elect people to make these decisions. Staff doesn't get to make these decisions. This stuff should come from the council. And if legal counsel is given bad advice on that, maybe need new legal counsel. Thank you. Anyone else seeing? No one. Can I have an alderman move the resolution? Do I have a second? Yes. Second. All right, Annie, discussion from council. Alderman. Yeah. Okay. Alderman Reinhart. Thank you. Thank you. Again. I will be offering a motion to table this agenda item for two cycles after my colleagues have had an opportunity to speak. I yield the floor to my colleagues. Alderman Burkholder, I just want you guys to know we hear you. We do hear you. We are listening. I agree. We need to table this. It needs to be more of an open discussion with my colleagues. We need to take that step back to move forward. So I thank you for all the conversations and the understanding. It has been open arms between my colleagues and I. But I do want you guys to know we do hear you and we are doing our very best with what we've got. So just be patient with us, okay? Alderman Kelly, thank you. As a person who just went through four weeks of trauma informed training, I want you guys to hear this piece that is interesting to me. Once again, I have no disrespect to the left of me, but do you notice the equation in the room that when the one solely black woman that has a law degree runs a department, fights legal issues, it issues. Nobody's arguing and fussing for her. And like I said, for two years, I didn't feel strong enough to speak up just for the simple point. Fact of I was put in the corner, you know what I'm saying? But now that baby's out of the corner, I feel comfortable to say. Do you guys see the part of this equation. I don't care if we have purple people on this panel. Why is it interesting that when it comes to the qualifications and what somebody else has, we have to argue and fight, but when somebody actually has the qualifications, the schooling, the knowledge, and the work, crickets are in the room.

Welcome to the April 11 meeting of the City of Davenport Zoning Board of Adjustment. The zoning Board of Adjustment holds public hearings to consider the strict application of the zoning ordinance for hardship variances, special uses and appeals. I'm Jeff Blumker. Members present today are, from left to right, myself and Bridget Boyd Carlson. Staff present are Laura Berkeley, Scott Coops and attorney Brian Hyer. If you have a mobile device, please turn it off as it may interfere with the room's electronics. Board member bumper, can you mention Dan Darlin? Oh, yes. And also present by teleconferences. Dan Darlin. Our normal chair. Again, if you have a mobile device, please turn it off as it may interfere with the room's electronics. As we conduct our business, we expect that everyone here will conduct themselves in a respectful, courteous and civil manner. And will speak only after being recognized by the chair. The only exception to this standard is that the staff is expected to interject when necessary to ensure we are properly conducting business. If anyone wishes to speak on a particular agenda item, you will be provided an opportunity to do so. When recognized by me, please step to the podium, introduce yourself and provide your input. By practice, each person is only permitted one opportunity to speak. Exceptions to that practice is at my discretion. Of course, if a board member asks a question of anyone, they will be permitted to speak to answer that question. But I'll ask that you keep your response limited to the specific question. So we'll move to our agenda. We'll approve the minutes from the last meeting of December 21, 2023. Any corrections to the minutes from that meeting hearing? None. May I have a motion for approval? Motion to approve. May I have a second? 2nd. Okay. By Dan darling Lewin. All in favor, give us. Aye. Aye. Opposed? Aye. Okay. Motion passes. We'll move on to the first item of business. Which is. Is there any old business to cover this time? Staff, any members have any old business we need to cover? No? Very good. Then we'll move on to new business. First item is a request. HV 240, one of Bray Architects, on behalf of Davenport Community schools at 1414 East Locust street, for a hardship variance to build an addition to the school, which will be approximately 45.3ft in height. Property zoned r four c zoning district allows for buildings 35ft in height or less as required in table 17.40. 117.041. Ward five staff want to take it from there. You want me to talk about three people? You want to go through all of them? No. Since we only have three board members present. Oh, okay. Yeah. Let me stipulate when we only have three board members present or at least offer the option to the applicants. This particular applicant, there are only three members present of this five member board. Approval of any motion requires the unanimous, unanimous vote of all three members present today. Our bylaws grant the chair the discretion to allow you to request a tabling of this hearing until a later date. Once the board hears your item, this opportunity to table will have passed. Applicant, would you like to proceed or would you like to have the hearing tabled? Can we proceed please? Okay, very good. Applicant has indicated they would like to proceed with three. And just, just a point of clarification for everybody listening is right now we only have four staff members on the board presently two here in person and one online. So we're missing one person today. Okay. Anything else that the applicants need to know, staff? So again, do you need me to reread the. Maybe you could ask ahead for the other two cases that we have as well if they want to participate. So yeah, enlighten brevity. Other applicants here, does everyone kind of understand the option? Everyone is okay with proceeding with your petition? Thank you. Very good. Okay, so the staff report. This is an older photo, of course. There's Washington school on the right and Sudlo on the left. Washington has been demolished. So again, the request is to build some new phases to Sudlo over time and those phases will be at approximately 49.3ft tall. The code for residential four reals allows for a 35 foot tall building. However, I did find out during my staff report research. I don't think it made the staff report, but the existing building is with the parapet wall. It is actually 49ft already. So the proposed changes aren't really going to increase the relative height.

There's Washington school on the right and Sudlo on the left. Washington has been demolished. So again, the request is to build some new phases to Sudlo over time and those phases will be at approximately 49.3ft tall. The code for residential four reals allows for a 35 foot tall building. However, I did find out during my staff report research. I don't think it made the staff report, but the existing building is with the parapet wall. It is actually 49ft already. So the proposed changes aren't really going to increase the relative height. So this is the Sudlo from the north. You can see kind of the new landscaped area they have there. And the buses come in on the left there. This is the elevation from the south from Sudlo or from Locust street. Looking at Sudlo, this is looking to the southeast. And again you can see there's three stories in this photo and the previous photo. The first floor is a little bit below grade, a portion of it. And this is looking from the west, looking east. And here's what they're proposing. Parts of the existing Sudlo are going to remain. And this portion here would be new. These portions I believe are the ones that are already there. And so the new portions would be at that 40, 45.3 foot height. This is the elevations. This is a chart that was in your staff report regarding the heights for each section. So again, this summary of just kind of what's required. The proposing 45.3, the code in residential areas requires 35. Again, as I said in the staff report, the 35 foot is basically set for the primary use of this district, which is single family and a limited two family dwellings. So the code does allow quasi institutional uses. And I don't know that the height limitation really takes that into effect. And so it kind of creates a need for special consideration. This is the notification we did. We sent out 67 notices. We had two phone calls asking questions about what was going on, but verbally, no protest. And written, we didn't receive any protests. Staff's findings. Item number one, application of the ordinance creating hardship is established. Item number two, physical surroundings. Imposing hardship is established. Item number three, unique circumstances established. And item number four, protection of essential character, is established. Staff recommends approval of hv 240. One. And then any questions from the board? I have a quick question. You said that one part of the building is already taller than the 45.3? According to the information we have from the developer, yes. This portion here is actually above 45ft in height. Okay. All right, thank you. Are there any concerns issued by the surrounding neighbors community? As I said, again, we had two phone calls. They basically just had questions on what was happening. Neither one said they were opposed to the request. And we have not received anything in writing, email, or delivered by hand or by mail. Staff did review the setbacks of the structure. I mean, it's a relatively large lot. The setbacks are greater than what is typical in this residential district. And so given that, I don't think that the additional height imposes any light or air issues for adjacent properties. Yeah. And to summarize, the purpose, it was in your staff report, but generally, the purpose of this is to reorganize the school district, and Sudlo wouldn't have an extra grade there, so they're adding on very large improvements. So instead of having two schools there which were there previously at an intermediate and an elementary school, it will be one. So overall, I would predict the use is generally the same as it had been with an elementary school and an intermediate school together. Yeah. Again, no visibility concerns, no environmental. That's all been okay? Yep. Any other questions? Dan, did you have any questions? No, I'm good, thanks. Okay, we'll ask the applicant to step up to the podium and present your request. Good afternoon. So I'm Carrie Uhlenkamp with Bray architects and the district has been going through a master planning which they're at the point now where they would like to add on to their middle schools. And this is where this comes from is, you know, we're not intending to create different character to impose upon the surroundings. We're just maximizing the site and reorganizing it so that we can accommodate three grade levels with the proper amount of classrooms. And there is some demolition, but then we're rebuilding in the same fashion, trying to make sure that we are doing it justice for something that will be longevity of Davenport. The imposing height restriction really does come from the residential section of it. Which, you know, typically would not be imposed on a building like this if it were not zoned. That, I guess. Are there other questions that would. Yeah. Do you want to cover the philosophical layout of the building and how the grades are intentionally separated out? I think that would be helpful. So the existing building has three stories and that's what we're proposing. One of the reasons that maintaining three stories will be very beneficial to the school is by having three grade levels. They can really create a house system where each grade level has its own floor. So 6th grade will be on top, which is the most isolated. And as coming into the school, that would be the biggest factor for them. They're going from elementary to middle school. Middle of the building would be 7th grade and then the bottom would be 8th grade. And so they're kind of getting ready to move out of the building. Right. By creating the three levels and maintaining the height of it, they can really create where a safety measurement. Also where the kids have a lot greater. They're not moving around as much. They can create little wings that they are calling houses. And it just creates a lot better system for the district. Moving forward.

If we were to not be able to build to the three stories, then two stories, and we'd have to sprawl farther, creating less amenities across the site. Also because we would have to take up just more square footage of the site. Mainly the only part of the building that we are asking for the variance is because the three story educational. You're fine. The other parts that we are building are not three stories. So the part closest to you is really their kitchen, their receiving. It'll have mechanical space on top, but shielded. The middle part that's in red is their cafeteria story, which is two stories. And so really the background is really just the three story part where they want to create those grade level per floor. And that's where this comes from. What type of special considerations will need to be deployed when actual construction takes place. In terms of. I presume the school kids will still be attending school in that building during construction. Yeah. So the whole existing building remains in place. The addition that you can see right here will be built adjacent to it while school is in construction. They're planning on just safeguarding it normally with the general contractor that's awarded it, I'm sure will have safeguards in place. They'll keep the construction to the one side where Washington currently is sitting. Will be a great place for the contractor to have lay down space, have all of their amenities over there fenced in away from the students. Construction is always hard, right? I mean, it's not going to be easy, but the kids will be safely in the building as existing and it's not until they move into this new addition that then they would start doing a lot more work in the building. Any questions from the board for the applicant? I just have one. I don't know whether it's for the board or staff. I'm not sure. With it being ten foot taller than the existing building, is there any marking requirements for consideration for the medevac helicopters coming into Genesis east? So the existing building is actually taller than the proposed building. We are actually reducing the height with our new addition. And the part that is the tallest actually gets demolished because it's the oldest part of the building, it's from 1912, so we're actually reducing the height of the building overall. Okay, so comment to say the proposed three story building will be 10ft taller than the existing three story building, but that existing piece will be coming down. Or is this a staff comment not correct? No, I think when I wrote that, that's before I found out that the existing building was 49ft tall. And what it's meant to say is it's 10ft above the allowed height of the district. Okay. But it's not taller than the existing building. No, it is not. With the first level being a little bit underground, it should be very equal to what you already have there. If you were to drive by that part of the building very much apples to apples, like it should not be more imposing than what is already there. It actually will be moving it towards the middle of the site so that you're even bringing the building a little bit off of those corners and kind of centralizing it more as a standalone building. Thank you for that clarification. I have no other questions. Anything else? Any other questions from the board? Okay, then we'll move on. Does anyone in the audience want to speak in favor of the request? Seeing none, we'll ask does anyone in the audience want to speak in opposition of the request? Okay. Hearing none. Applicant will ask if you have any final comments. I do not. Very good. Thanks so much. Thank you. Move on to board discussion. Any comments, concerns from the board? Personally, I think this is everything that's proposed is within character. And since the height issues clear to my brain now, I think we're good to go. Yeah. I visited the site yesterday and I can't imagine if there's any should be any concerns relative to the surrounding area or otherwise. Very good. Then we'll ask for a motion. Motion to approve HB 240.

That being request SU 240, one of QC sick temple at 1501 East 52nd street for a special use to establish a place of worship on property zoned CT commercial transitional as required in table 17.081. May we have the staff report, please? Okay. Scott Copes, community planning. This site, if you're familiar with, is near 53rd and eastern. There's the Toyota, smart Toyota on the corner. There's steel plow to the north of the site. There's a neighborhood to the south. This is the property. It's a little more zoomed in. If you can see, there's significant vegetation barrier along the southern portion of the lot. It's 139ft deepest or actually might be a little less than 110ft. I think this is the zoning map. It shows where the CT zoning is. Our CT zoning district is a transitional zoning district and it's intended to buffer the more intense commercial districts like the c three on the corner from things like the r three to the south. And because it's a buffer district, and because it doesn't have parking regulations required, there's a special use permit required for a place of worship. This slide shows the site plan. The parking lot exceeds the number of spaces that are required, and each stall and drive, well, each stall is wider and deeper than what's required as well. The rear of the structure is at least 330ft from the nearest dwelling to the south. Again, there's about 27,000 wooded area on the rear of the property, and at its deepest, it's 120ft deep. That buffer is. This slide just shows the site plan a little bit more zoomed in so you can see some more of the detail. So the zoning ordinance in the zoning use matrix, this just shows you where the special use requirement comes into play. And again, the primary issue for staff is that this district does not require parking. And so when we look at the parking calculations, even at work required, they would only be required to have ten spaces. They have well over that. And then we did get, after the staff report went out, I did get some information from our traffic division and they gave us the go ahead that they don't see any problems for this property. And we have those details if you want me to read the full statement. But we did do our notices to 13 adjacent property owners within 200ft. We received one comment via email. It was not signed and that was distributed to the board via email and it's at the bottom of this slide as well. And if you would like, I could read that to you. The location of that property is basically due south of the point, the further southern point of the lot. And our findings the establishment, maintenance and operation of the proposed special use will not endanger the public health or safety or welfare of the city of Davenport. The proposed special use is compatible with the general land use of adjacent properties and other properties within the immediate vicinity. And item number three, the special use in the specific location proposed is consistent with the spirit and intent of the ordinance and the adopted land use policies. Staff recommends approval of SU 240 one as proposed and if the board has questions of staff, any questions? Yeah, this is Dan. Since the one complaint was about traffic, would you mind reading in the traffic division to report? Yes, I can do that. We have it for consideration. Yep. And this is from Jerry Vondere and she's assistant traffic engineer manager. According to the ItE trip generation, the place of worship will generate three to four trips in the peak am Monday through Friday between 07:00 a.m. and 09:00 a.m. and approximately five trips in the peak Pm Monday through Friday between 04:00 p.m. and 06:00 p.m. therefore, the additional trips generated during the weekday are so few that it will not be noticeable. It will not have a noticeable impact on the transportation system on Sunday during the peak hour, ite trip generation says they may generate 100 trips per hour within about 50 entering and exiting. This is a traditional church. I assume since they are planning for 45 parking spaces, they will not generate as much traffic as a traditional church. Since the existing traffic on Eastern Avenue and East 53rd street is much less on Sunday than on a weekday. The additional trip generated by this place of worship on a Sunday will have very little impact on the transportation system. And that's the end of this statement. 52nd street adaption. 52nd street is a loop. It connects to 53rd and it connects to eastern. Okay, what is the new development going on? Just down the road at the corner of 52nd and 53rd, there's a veterinary clinic being proposed or built, I should say. I have a question. So that's Toyota, correct? And they're closed on Sundays, right? That's my knowledge, yes. Okay. So any other questions from the board hearing? None. We'll move on. Does anyone in the audience want to speak in favor of the request? Hearing? None. Anyone in the audience want to speak in opposition of the request? Has the applicant presented yet? No, we haven't had the. I apologize, I've skipped over. Can we have the applicant come up and offer your presentation? Thank you. My name is Sameer Kulkarni.

Can we have the applicant come up and offer your presentation? Thank you. My name is Sameer Kulkarni. I'm director of design at Bush Construction and I represent the applicant in this case. So sikh temple of the quad cities has been here for about over three decades. So they're just about a mile and a half to west of this lot on 53rd. And the reason they are looking to relocate is the hardship of various other creeks and other things. They are not able to expand, and this seemed to be the most logical lot for them to look at, this being the next 25 years of community service that they do. From a lot standpoint, we intentionally chose a larger lot just so we could have a lot of buffer and a lot of parking and really take care of any neighborhood issues. In this particular case, the lot itself, as you can see, is adequately buffered on the south, which is about, I would say, more than 100ft right now. The building is about more than 100ft from the lot line on the corner south lot point. And the vegetation and the natural topography, all that should really not affect either the site or the activity of a Sikh temple and most of their activities being indoors on a Sunday. So I think the parking is adequate and they're typically full only on Sundays within that three or four hour span. So from a traffic standpoint, I don't see that being a concern on the 52nd street because it's not literally throwing everything out on 53rd, which is the most more busier street. So they kind of have options of going either to eastern or back onto 53rd because this being a loop. So I request that this special zoning use, special use be approved. Okay. Any questions from the board of the petitioner? No. Dan, did you have any questions? Yeah. When we discussed the tree buffer to the south, are those trees just all volunteers, or were those purpose planted there? Do we know they're all existing trees? We're just going to maintain that because the land slopes down considerably from the point that you see on the site plan. So they're all existing trees that we are going to leave them as is, not plant any new ones? I don't believe that they were ever. I think, to your point, they're natural growth trees. I don't think there was any planned plantings of those trees. Yep. All right, thanks, Laura. Anything else from the board? Okay, now we'll fall back to proper procedure. Anyone in the audience want to speak in favor of this request hearing? None. Anyone want to speak in opposition to this request hearing? None. Applicant, do you have any final comments? I don't. Thank you. Okay. Thank you so much. Move on to board discussion. Any concerns and comments from the board in this matter? No. You know, one comment. I've been looking up here while we've been talking as well, but, yeah, car dealerships, it's actual state, certain ordinance or law, but car dealerships cannot be opened on Sunday. So that's the only day of traffic conflict. You don't want to be an issue. There was some additional recommendations by staff and report about those. The trees to the south remaining and, you know, remaining, kind of why I asked the question. Your trees, you know, trees die. So I don't know if there's a better way to word that, but, yeah, we want to keep a vegetation buffer. So if we lose vegetation, will there be a requirement to put in more vegetation? You know, trees die. Do they have to plant trees to make up for it? The only question about the recommendation, and then there's two other recommendations that seem to make sense, and I don't have a question about. It's up to the. I think it would be up to the board whether you want to stipulate that they be replaced as needed or since it's not required by the code. There is not really a buffer required. Staff just did want to make sure it wasn't deliberately removed, and there are no plans to remove them. And I understand trees may and do die over time, but again, more trees might be coming as well. Naturally as well. Sure. Can we just say that it shall be maintained as opposed to shall remain. That's fine. This is up too far. Okay. You okay with that, Bridget? Fine. Yeah. Yeah. And I apologize. The staff report on the presentation that I'm doing, did not carry forward those conditions. But they were in the packet, so that's my fault. I was out of the site yesterday and I couldn't see that it would cause any concerns for the surrounding area. I couldn't see any traffic issues. It seemed like a very appropriate site for this type of use. Any other board discussion hearing? None. I'll ask for a motion. All right, I'll motion. Let me make a motion here. I'll motion to approve su 240 one, incorporating the three staff recommendations with the edit of the first recommendations stating that the existing trees on the southern portion, the lot, shall be maintained to serve as a vegetation vegetative buffer.

So I presume that took care of items two and three, is that correct, or do we have. That took care of the special use. Now we have a presentation on the hardship variances, which, if need be, they can be voted on separately or they could be voted on together. Okay. Then we move on to item number three. This is request hv 240 two and zero three of bush construction on behalf of QC Sik temple at 1501 East 52nd street for a hardship variance to establish a place of worship on property zoned at C T commercial transitional district with a building over 5000 set back outside of the zero to 20 foot build to zone. This is in ward seven. Okay. So again, this is a use proposed in the CT district, which is kind of a buffer transitional district, from heavy commercial uses to residential and other lower intense uses. The nature of most of these lots are that they're much smaller and they're in more often. They're traditionally in built up areas, and so they have smaller lots. This is kind of a unique situation. It's a very large lot. It's on a brand new subdivided area. And so given the size of this lot, some of these restrictions don't necessarily make a lot of sense. So the one requirement that it be 5000 sqft or less doesn't really seem to apply to this situation. The proposed building is for 10,300 sqft, or is it 200? Yeah, 300. And the other requirement of the code section, when we did the zoning overhaul and we replaced all the code sections, the CT district, along with the C one district, had some build to zones where they wanted buildings to address the street in the more pedestrian neighborhoods. This is a subdivision or, I'm sorry, it's a suburban area, and it's not necessarily as suburban or as pedestrian friendly as where most of these CT uses go. And so I'll get to our analysis in a minute, but. So the building is technically supposed to be within the first 20ft south of the property line, and it's exceeding that. It's set back farther, given the nature of the building that they're proposing, and they want to have a walkout in the rear. And it makes sense to have the building where it's at, given that. But I'll get to my analysis here in a second. Again, this is the site shown at a closer up, and we did our notices and there was nothing. No comments by phone or by email. The one email we got I gave you earlier, it didn't specifically state anything regarding hardship variances. It stated about the use. So I put that with the other request. The findings, the application of the ordinance creating a hardship is established, the physical surroundings imposing the hardship is established, unique circumstance is established, and protection of essential character is established. And staff recommends approval of both HB 2402 and HB 240. Three board questions. Thank you, staff. Any questions from the board for. I have a question. So, 10,000 sqft, roughly, versus 5000 on two and a quarter acres. Scott, do you know by chance what the acreage is of the lot 1423 to the west? I do not know. It's a really irregular shape. It might be somewhat close to this lot, but a lot of it's not usable because it's so narrow to the west of that lot, the west portion of that lot. And there's some easements on the west side of that lot, but no, I don't know the acreage of the other. The other lot. I would guess it's slightly less. 1.8. Is the other lot to the west the size of that lot? Do you have a concern, Dan? Maybe. I don't know. Okay, we dumped him. We're still gone. Okay. You still. Dan, are you still there? No. Okay. Any other questions of staff from the board? No, but we can. We can call him on the phone if need be. So we need to suspend the proceedings until we get them back on. You trying to dial his cell phone directly? Okay. Please enter your access code, followed by the pound, or. To enable audio controls, please enter your audio. Hello? Great. We got you. Sorry about that. Yeah. All right. Can you hear us? Okay, Dan? Yep, I got you. Okay, we'll get back on track here. Was there an issue you wanted to pursue with a question about the site? Yeah, I guess trying to make a supportive point because the property to the west doesn't look like the building footprint of it is nearly the size of this one because the way the property drops off. So the point I guess I was trying to get at by figuring out what the acreage of that was, was that it made us more for discussion. But, you know, the 5000 foot building on the adjacent property to the west would probably be a tighter fit than a 10,000 square foot building on this piece of property. So that part's probably more for the discussion. But I was just trying to get to the size of that lot is all. I don't have any other questions. Yeah, I think so. This is Laura and I think traditionally speaking I don't. Scott and I've talked about this and it may have been in the staff report. I don't think the regulations associated with the CT district were specifically outlined for a place of worship. I think really when the regulations were written it was to think about office space and it would be, as Scott said, more in infill areas where you already have existing structures on the same street to keep the same massing of those types of buildings.

So that part's probably more for the discussion. But I was just trying to get to the size of that lot is all. I don't have any other questions. Yeah, I think so. This is Laura and I think traditionally speaking I don't. Scott and I've talked about this and it may have been in the staff report. I don't think the regulations associated with the CT district were specifically outlined for a place of worship. I think really when the regulations were written it was to think about office space and it would be, as Scott said, more in infill areas where you already have existing structures on the same street to keep the same massing of those types of buildings. So we don't necessarily have that in this case. Also, generally speaking, places of worship are allowed by. Right. In residential districts with no. No size restrictions. So if this had happened to be a residential district, it would be able to be built at this size without a hardship variance. Okay, thank you. Any other questions from the board of staff? No hearing. None. We'll ask the applicant to step to the podium and address this particular request. Thank you again. My name is Samit Kulkarni. I'm director of design and Bush construction. So the two hardship variances that we're talking about are really something that we feel that this particular project cannot afford to comply with just because of the fact that the building itself needs to be about. About 10,000 sqft. It's got a prayer area, it's got a dining area. So all of that put together, we cannot split the building into two parts and it becomes very inconvenient for the community to use this facility. And we're looking at this getting bigger and bigger. So we feel the 5000 sqft will put substantial hardship. So we request for that variance. And then the 20 foot setback is also going to be challenging purely for the fact that we need some. This is going to be a large enough building that you need some foreground from the street. So it feels like we will be losing a lot of the drop off area. Most of the frontage will be taken up by drop off area and all the parking goes back. So this is also not a very desirable situation when everybody wants to be up in the front. And I think that is another reason I would like to make here for that hardship variance to be allowed to reiterate what the petitioner has said, due to the topography, it makes more sense to have the flatter area be the parking area in the front and actually may be more beneficial to the neighbors to the south to have the building there instead of the vehicles, which may. The vehicles may be more of the nuisance component with the noise and headlights and things like that. So it actually is kind of shielding that neighborhood a little bit more. And with the overflow parking lot for smart Toyota to the east as well, you already have the parking lot in line with what they're requesting for their parking lot. Also the safety and privacy of a place of worship to be considered when you have that set back. Okay, very good. Are there any questions from the board of the petitioner? No. Dan, any questions to the petitioner? No. Very good. Then we'll move on. Anyone in the audience want to speak in favor of the request hearing? None. Anyone in the audience wants to speak in opposition of the request. Are you non applicant? Do you have any final comments on this matter? No, I don't. Thank you so much. Thank you. Okay, we'll open up the board discussion. Comments, concerns by the board. It's pretty well covered. Yeah, I really don't have anything additional. I guess trying to get to the point asking the question abor covered the size restriction intent, but also I think given the size of the property from a ratio point, I think it fits well. And the setback makes sense. I'm good with it. Okay. Very good. I'll ask for a motion. Staff would ask unless you feel necessary. I would request that we do one motion for both hardship variances at the same time. Okay. Again, staff is asking for a motion to cover both hardship variances. Does the board have any problem with that? Motion to approve HB 240 two and HB 240 three motion by Bridget, second by Dan. And roll call Boyd Carlson. Yes. Dan. Darlin. Yeah. And blumker. Yes. Very good. Thanks. Thanks again, petitioner. Thank you. Okay, we move on to item number four. Request SU 240 two of Christopher Ketts at 1527 Brady street for a special use to establish a bed and breakfast on property zoned C T commercial transitional district as required by table 17.081. This is in ward five. Staff Scott Cope or community planning and zoning out at public works. I'm a few years behind. I don't know if any of you are familiar with this property at the corner of Brady and Kirkwood, but it's been owned by not St. Ambrose, but Palmer for St. Ambrose. That's right. For a long time now, they've had functions very similar to what they're proposing in this use. Now, today, the code was recently changed because we noticed there was an oversight that if you did have a residentially built structure, but if it was in the CT, it wouldn't allow for a bed and breakfast, which is kind of silly when they're allowed in the residential districts. So we fixed that, and we have a request today for a bed and breakfast at this CT location. It is built as a house. It is a large house. It is a grand house. And I think the use is going to be making good use for this space. Here's the zoning map, and here's the site plan, which shows the rear parking spaces. There's 15 spaces back in the alley. They're able to use off street parking on Kirkwood as well. So this use has a principal use standard. So every use in the zoning code could have a principle use standard. Some don't, some do. This one does. Basically, the principal use standard is a way for us to highlight things that we want the use to meet.

And staff reviewed the requirements for the special use standards and they meet those standards or will meet those standards. Number one, the exterior of a bed and breakfast must maintain the original appearance as a single family dwelling, and it will. Cooking equipment is prohibited in guestrooms. They do not have plans for that. No retail sales are permitted except for ancillary retail items such as souvenirs, etcetera. There's no major retail proposed, and they're not going to operate as a restaurant. Number five, the sign, one sign is permitted, and they are not going to exceed what the code allows there. So as proposed or how it's going to operate, it will meet these requirements. We sent out 15 notices. We did not receive anything. Oh, and we did have a letter of support. That's right. Thank you for reminding me. I think so much of adjacent average, but. So we did receive a letter of support and it was in the packet from the hilltop association, and they are in favor of the request. Our findings, the establishment, maintenance and operation of the proposed special use will not endanger the public health or safety or welfare. Number two, the proposed special use is compatible with the general land use and adjacent properties. Number three, special use is in this specific location, is consistent with the spirit intent of this ordinance and adapted land use policies. In many senses, this is almost the perfect site for a bed and breakfast. Our recommendation does have three conditions. One, if there should be a problem with neighborhood parking, or if complaints arise or the streets are too tight, or if should parking be removed on Kirkwood, staff would just like the right to reserve to have some adjacent parking agreements, should that be necessary. Number two, all building codes shall be met. This will be met right now. And they do have sprinklers in there. But I kind of put that in there because sprinklers are required for a bed and breakfast. And number three, all principal use standards that we just discussed. They shall be met well in operation. I just wanted to put that in as a new condition that I didn't have in the actual packet that went out. But I just like to reiterate that those conditions, while they appear met at this time, they would need to be in conformance during the operation as well. And questions from the board. Any questions from the board for staff? Yeah. Is this now going to be a privately held bed and breakfast as opposed to the foundation or whoever had it from St. Ambrose? That is correct. The applicant, if there was a sale to some individuals that actually live in the area and are doing some restoration work on the building currently. So it's no longer owned by St. Ambrose or any association with the institution. Okay, thank you. Do we know what's the maximum occupancy with the proposed setup? The petitioner is here, so. Oh, okay. I'll save that. Any other questions of the staff by the board? Okay, hearing? None. We'll ask the applicant to please step up to the podium, present the request. Hello, I am Chris Kretz, owner operator of what we're calling the hilltop Inn of Davenport. Formerly St. Ambrose alumni House, formerly the bishop's house Inn or the Bishop's Inn? I think it was a bed and breakfast when St. Ambrose bought it. I'm not sure. 2030 years ago, something like that. They actually ran it a couple years as a b and b before they converted to offices and special event stuff. As Laura stated, we're currently doing a lot of restoration and historical preservation to both the interior and exterior. And right now the interior is fully functional. We have six. Six bedrooms and can sleep up to 14 people if needed, from full to king beds. And four of those bedrooms have their own bathroom. And then two bedrooms would have a shared bathroom. So other than that. Just aside from a b and B. Hoping to get some special events, off site, business retreats type thing? Possibly. But moving forward? Yeah, sooner the better to get some things rented out, but other than that, yeah. We purchased this just because it kind of fell in our lap. We previously purchased a home from Ambrose and Redid that. They liked it so much, they approached us when they wanted to sell this one. So, loving historic houses, and being a historic house nut myself, we jumped at it. So that's where we are. Thank you. Any questions from the board of the petitioner? Dan, you have anything? No, not for me. Thanks, Bridget. So, again, what would be the maximum occupancy if you were to. It can sleep up to 14. As far as special event stuff, we'll have to see what that comes out to, but I'm guessing it'll be between 50 and 75. If you have, like, a small wedding or rehearsal dinner or something like that.

Would the occupancy change if you were to make those overall, as far as how many people you can fit in a building? You know, I'm sure that that would be part of it, but as far as sleeping arrangements, you know, the bed and breakfast part, that would be totally locked off and separate. Okay. So it would not be. Yeah. Two of the offices could technically be converted into bedrooms, but they were at one time. When it was a bed and breakfast 30 years ago, the third floor was where the owners lived, and kitchen, bathrooms, and everything out there, bedrooms. But we don't plan on renting that out that way.

So we are very proud of the officers in our department and we're excited to add these, to add these all actually to our agency. So thank you again for your support. We'll go ahead and pause a moment. If folks would like to leave. You're welcome to stay for the rest of the meeting, but go enjoy your new police officer. It okay, thank you. We'll carry on with the agenda. Next is petition to communications. Anyone tonight? Alderwell McGinnis. Thank you, your honor. Just a couple of things I wanted to thank the folks who came out last night, the planning and zoning meeting. The hearing for the vacation of West Fifth street at the Frank L. Smart school location was last night at the Frank Smart School. The planning and zoning commission will take that up again at their meeting on May 14, Tuesday, May 14, at 05:00 p.m. in council chambers. And certainly anyone from the public is invited if they wish to comment. And then I am holding my word. Meeting will not be the third Monday, which would be Monday, May 20, but it will be Thursday, May 23, at 630 again at Frank L. Smart. And this meeting is to talk a little bit again about the construction, more about that and kind of their plans. They have some interesting concepts of learning and what's going to happen at that site. It's pretty exciting. And anybody. Frank Alsmart reaches an area way to the east of Frank Elsmart, and way to the west and almost up to locust. It's a large group of our. A large area of our city. It will be 6th, 7th, and 8th grades. And so some really interesting concepts that'll be going on there. And people are certainly invited to come and learn about that. I also wanted to mention there has been a concern of recent about some adult business activity in third ward that is being addressed. I wanted to let everybody know that. I hope that it comes to a quick conclusion, but it is something that I've been working on for several weeks. And so I just want to let folks know who might be concerned. So we're working on it. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Guinness. Alderman Kelly, thank you. I appreciate the moment to speak. All right, mama. So I have a few concerns that have been bugging me. I know you guys don't care about me, and I'm cool with that, because I didn't come down here for. I understand that I have to do the work, and the work is hard. Let me tell you, the way I get hit from the public, I get it. But to be hit from this class of folks over here to the left, aka the employees, how they are protected by the city of Davenport. Whenever I have a complaint, it's always an investigation. But I never get answers to my investigation. And I say that to say this, because the civil rights Commission is always ongoing stuff that they entertain when they do something wrong. The only department in the city that is black and brown, and they entertain this stuff weekly and monthly. But let me tell you, if it was in finance, you wouldn't have it. If it was in another department, you wouldn't have it. If it was in public works, you wouldn't have it. So why is this something that we have to take weeks and months to investigate to? And if you want me to name drop, because I can't say names of the other people that I have complained about. Alison Fleming. I've had so many complaints that have come to me and gone to you guys, and it's always an investigation. When does the investigation stop?

Anybody got an answer for that? And you know what I'm talking about, because we entertain this on a weekly basis. It's tiring. I'm tired of getting emails of something that you guys can handle. Cause I'm only supposed to deal with the administrator and the lawyer. But why am I getting all these complaints? Because you guys aren't doing anything. These investigations are ongoing, and they're small things that can be taken care of within a day and or a week. Why are we months into investigations? Why? And I'd hate to hit this nail on the head, Mallory, when you came to get your money, there was discussions. You got your money. Why is the civil rights. Why are they still waiting on the money from the city? And we're talking about money that we have to give away. What are we waiting on? Y'all gonna look at me like I'm crazy, but y'all know what I'm talking about. It's getting old. You don't want to say that there's racism in the city, but it's apparent that when something happens and it's somebody of color. Oh, no, no, no. That's not what we meant. Well, what did you mean? You don't move fast. You all sit around going, no, no, no, no. And then I look crazy. I don't look crazy. They don't look crazy. Y'all look crazy. Because the irony is you will never know what it's like to be in America, a black man in America, when things can't happen as fast as they happen for you. Why am I in a position where nothing can happen for me and or the people that I serve on a regular basis? Do you know how hard it is for me to come down here? I now see a shrink. I now go to a headache clinic for those that care. Oh, you don't. Trying to do the right thing. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Reiners. Thank you.

Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this matter, please step to the podium. State your name, Ward, or address. Derek Cornett, south ward. I was just wondering if anybody could tell me how that number was reached. Was this just a number that was sent to you guys and we're voting on it, or was it just a guess? Because this budget was. The last corporate bond thing was 27 million. So you figured, add 5%, 10%, that's going to be our next one. I mean, if they don't give you any numbers or any reason why they're doing stuff, you know, I think I'd ask why you're giving them permission to do 31 million. Nobody knows it's our tax money. You're allocating it. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public wishing to address this item? Seeing none, I move to close the public hearing. Second hearing a second. I would ask.

So the association of Public Treasurers of the United States and Canada represents public treasury and financial officials in local, county, and state provincial governments throughout North America. Their mission is to provide quality treasury management education and training, professional certification, peer interaction, and professional connection opportunities for public treasury and financial officials. The association of Public Treasurers of the United States and Canada Investment Policy Certificate of Excellence Award is a nationally recognized distinction designed to elevate an organization's commitment and best practices in management and investment of public funds on behalf of its constituents. The APT Us and C has a comprehensive policy review process which is made up of 15 public and private sector volunteers who score policies based on 16 policy components, including delegation of authority, ethics and conflict of interest, authorized financial institutions, safekeeping and custody, diversification, internal controls, performance standards, and much more. The City of Davenport's investment policy was first adopted by city council in 1992 and has been revised multiple times, most recently in March of this year. The investment policy establishes and maintains an internal control structure in the finance department to safeguard Davenport's assets from lost, theft or misuse, and I'll be happy to present this plaque to Jim O'Dean, the interim finance director, who will receive the award. The black reads, association of Public Treasurers of the United States and Canada Certificate of Excellence Investment Policy awarded to the City of Danport, Iowa, in recognition of conformance to the specified standards of investment policy as established by the association 2024. Congratulations. Thank you very much. Three. All right. Thank you. All right. All right. Jim O'Dean, interim finance Director I just want to thank the mayor and council for recognizing the finance department for department's achievement, for receiving this award from the association of Public Treasurers. The award demonstrates the finance department's commitment to being responsible stewards of the city's public funds and continually raising the bar in our financial management practices. I'd also like to recognize Becky Woolms, who's not able to be here tonight, but she's instrumental in the investment process and attaining this award. So thank you very much. Thank you. Next is petition communications. Anyone seeing? None? Okay, we'll move to our. I apologize. Now I see. Now I see some. Alderman Kelly, please. Thank you. I should really get to the point where I write this stuff down, but I love speaking from my heart. So as long as the narrative is being spoken and there's no investigations on these narratives, and we have new people on council, and you want new outcomes, there's never going to be a new outcome when we're up to the same old tricks. So, with that being said, we can keep perpetuating this stuff and letting it go on and on and on. But if you know me, come talk to me. Even if you don't know me, come talk to me. I ain't got nothing to hide. I ain't got nothing to hide. And guess who they ain't? They ain't coming for me because I didn't drink the Kool aid.

Now I see some. Alderman Kelly, please. Thank you. I should really get to the point where I write this stuff down, but I love speaking from my heart. So as long as the narrative is being spoken and there's no investigations on these narratives, and we have new people on council, and you want new outcomes, there's never going to be a new outcome when we're up to the same old tricks. So, with that being said, we can keep perpetuating this stuff and letting it go on and on and on. But if you know me, come talk to me. Even if you don't know me, come talk to me. I ain't got nothing to hide. I ain't got nothing to hide. And guess who they ain't? They ain't coming for me because I didn't drink the Kool aid. So what I want you to know is we will never have a new outcome with these ten individuals because they say what they say to you. But the way we talk about each other's back, I'm the only one. You'll never have to hear that I said something behind my back. Because guess what? I'll say it right here in this dias. And y'all know that. So we will never get new outcomes with the same old folks doing the same old food. Shukris. If we don't have any investigations, I will hold that over and over and over. All these investigations, and everybody wants to point a finger at me. I'm slick with the mouth. Yes, I am. Mm hmm. Very slick. But it's called poke a bear. So to every action is a reaction. So don't say something that you don't think I'm not going to react to, because for 50 years of my life, I have put other people first. For the next 50, it's all about me. So while I'm in this position, I will work for the city of Davenport, and I will work for my constituents. But please, don't poke the bear. Thank you. Thank you, alderman mcGinnis. Thank you, your honor. Just wanted to remind everybody that the third ward meeting for May will not be next Monday at its regular time, but it will be next Thursday, May 23. Not tomorrow, but next Thursday May 23 at 06:30 p.m. it will be at the Frank Smart School library. Enter at the 6th street door. We will be talking about the plans for the new school. There is a new school being built there. Most of the school that is there there now will not be there. It is an entire campus that encompasses all of the land that the school has, or that is the plan. It's a different approach to education. It will serve students widely and three grades widely across the center and west side of the city. So it's a chance to really talk to the school board. Of course, this is the school district's plan, not the cities. But it's a chance to talk to them and learn about this exciting about $52 million project that they will be constructing there on the west end of Davenport. So I hope you can join us. Everybody's welcome. That's Thursday. May Frank L. Smart school. Thank you, your honor. Thank you. Anyone else? Very good. We'll move to the four items of discussion. Community development, public safety, public works, and finance. The first one is community development. Alderman Reinerts will discuss. Alderman Reinerts, please. Thank you, mister mayor. We have four items under community development. The first one being second consideration ordinance for case Ord 240. Two being the request of the city of Davenport to amend chapter 17.08 entitled Uses of the Municipal Code of Davenport, Iowa by updating the billboard definition and principle use standards for all wards. Is there any public with comment? Here's Cornett, 7th ward. I'm really getting tired of these cannabis advertisements on the billboards. They just keep proliferating. What is the problem with the city? It's not legal in Iowa. Quit letting them advertise here. You're just propagating people going to Illinois, buying drugs and bringing them back across the border. It's a federal offense. If you guys can't see that, it's wrong. What the hell is going on? You know, we have laws for people to enforce them. Why don't you look at that and do your jobs? You know, when you're putting these regs into place, tell them what they can and can't do with these billboards. I mean, this is a disgrace. Any other public would comment. Counsel? Moving on. Second item. First consideration. Ordinance for the case, row 240. Two being the request of the city of Davenport, Iowa to vacate a portion of Lorton Place between Lorton Avenue and Lombard Court. Is there anyone from the public wishing to comment? Gary Eklin. I live in Davenport. I wasn't going to speak to this. I wish again that I don't have. I have migraines. I don't have a computer. Computer. I hate looking at the stuff on the Internet. I read the summary here. This doesn't tell me anything about what the vacation is for. I really don't want to speak to this, but I really wish that you would be a little bit more forthcoming in explaining what it is this is for, whether it's being vacated for a business or for an individual or for some other reason, there's just no explanation here. And it could be giving away a lot of city money to somebody for financial gain. It could be for a perfectly good idea. I have no idea because the summary here doesn't really explain anything. Thank you. Anyone else? Counsel? Alderman Jovian. Thank you. No rebuttal here other than just, you know, this is an area in the 6th Ward residential area. This. This street, you know, probably maybe 50ft in length, kind of little offshoot, creates kind of almost like a little five points area. Just kind of difficult, confusing. And so the person that lives on the corner, we're going to vacate that land, take away that roadway, decrease some of the confusion for vehicular traffic, and not have a little section of road to have to worry about plowing and messing up and all that.

Five being the request of accion construction on behalf of Red Barn storage, LLC for a final plat of room and second edition, and a one lot subdivision of 3.37 acres located at 3901 Hickory Grove Road. Is there anyone from the public wishing to make a comment? Council. Moving on, item number four. Resolution of support for submission of a workforce housing tax credit application to the Iowa Economic Development Authority for the proposed Riverview Heights housing project in the 700 block of East 6th street and approving an urban revitalization tax exemption application for the same Riverview Heights, LLC. Petitioner ward three. Anyone from the public wishing to make comment? Yeah, Gary Eckland. I live in Davenport and I've thought a lot about this since the presentation a week or two or three ago, whatever it was. And I am 100% opposed to this. When I was thinking about it, I was thinking about. This is, if I remember right, it's a 16 plex apartment complex. No. No. Is this not the one that was going to go on five lots? No. Well, it is an LLC. And if I am getting this mixed up again, I certainly apologize. It was my understanding that this was for apartments. If it's for a house, it says housing project for the proposed Riverview Heights housing project. And so I'll be more general then, but specific as well. If this is for an apartment complex that we're going to subsidize, I'm 100% opposed to it. I've been thinking a lot about some of the apartments that were torn down by the city in Palmer and the comments that the public work staff made. The public work staff made. They said that these apartment complex and there were apartments on East 9th and East 10th that I was in and out of. They were cement. They looked sturdy. I think they could have lasted 100 years. But the city staff and the public works department said that the city and Palmer were tearing them down because there were too many black people who lived there and they wanted to rid the neighborhood of poor black people and to tear down dozens of perfectly good apartment buildings in order to remove poor black people from a neighborhood and then take tax money and give to them to somebody to build new housing is ridiculous. We need new housing. But when you have the city public works department employees saying out loud that they're demolishing housing to remove black people from the city, and then we turn around and give money, I'll sit down. I've made my point. We have a racist city government. Anyone else from the public? Cheryl Shagna, third ward. If this is the land I'm thinking about, it is the land next to the Colonel Davenport house. So a couple of things I would like for the city to consider before they make these agreements are, first of all, I don't know how you acquired the land. You say it's city owned. I do not know if it was donated or not. But if it was donated, I would like you all to consider what was the donor's intention when that land was donated. And if it goes back to Colonel Davenport and him giving the land to the city, I doubt very much that his intention was to ever have a housing complex on that land. Additionally, like Gary brings up often, is the native american consideration. And I married a man whose father was born on a indian reservation, and he is Yankton Sioux Indian. And that makes my children yanked and Sioux Indian. Native American. And what has been done to this land is atrocious. The pollution, the noise pollution, all of it. There's been no respect, no stewardship of the land in Davenport other than a pet project or two. That is a park, if that is virgin soil that has never been dug on, and if there's any potential or any possibility that you guys run across any native american artifacts, I'm going to insist that any work stop. Also considering the monarch butterfly that Gary usually brings up, and if there is milkweed up there, there's a good chance the butterflies are going up there. So I really like you all to give some serious consideration. This is a really sweet piece of property, really sweet land. And again, I don't know that the donor or exactly how the city got the property, but again, if it's never been, you've got lots of land with buildings that can come down. There's other places where someone can build a nice housing development, if possible. So please take time to consider this. I am in the third wardrobe. Thank you. Anyone else from the public? Anyone from council? All have been done. Thank you. Can we have someone from staff come up and give us an overview of this project? And I'm kind of curious, do we own the land? We do. We do. Well, Bruce Burger, community and economic development. Yeah, we own the now six parcels. They were originally in the 1960s, single family houses. That's at the northwest corner of 6th and Sylvan Avenue. So it's a block or so from the Antoine Leclair house. Yeah, there were single family houses on the entire bluff, and we acquired them as they were demolished, kind of over a 30 year period. Oliver McGinnis. Thank you.

Yeah, I just wanted to also just make mention, I know that there is concern expressed often when property is leased or passed along to a new owner. I just also, I want to point out that the person who is doing this construction is purchasing this land. I think it was $31,000, which is, I think, slightly above its assessed value. So in this case, the person building these is actually part of his project just to purchase those from the city. This particular part of 6th street, very likely, many, many, many years ago, was part of Colonel Davenport's property. He owned land from where his house is all the way down to the river. But he certainly sold a lot of land for development of the city. He donated land in places for churches. He's a very generous donor for churches. But this land has been. Was developed for a couple of hundred years, or 100 years at least, and he passed away in the 1850s or 1861, in any case. This street sat sort of fallow, looking for its next purpose. It is in a great location, but it is. And it has neighborhood around it that's very stable. It's not a fancy neighborhood, but people are there, and many people have lived there for a long time, but these houses have become deteriorated. They were gone, I think, before I came to the city. And so the city looked long and hard of how to do this. So some of houses on this street on the south side and the north side were urban homestead projects by the city of Davenport. And then most recently on the south side, humility, who had also built some homes on the south side, had constructed homes back probably 20 years ago, but now they came back and they just finished an enormous project. You know, it's a street filled with houses. Again, it's a neighborhood. This particular bluff section is very difficult to build on. It is very beautiful, but it's difficult to build on and again, set empty. There was an attempt several years ago for the, there was a plan to build homes, single family homes there. The builder, the person who entered into the agreement with the city, was not able to do it because of the financial situation. And so it sat again as the south side began to fill up, waiting for the right project. This really does seem to be the right project. It will be, you know, it will be a certainly a mixed neighborhood if the, it has to be rezoned as multifamily, but it will be single family homes and multi purpose homes. And that is a mix of neighborhood. It's not just one kind of construction there. I'm looking forward to it. There is no money going from the city in the sense of cash going to this. The workforce housing tax credit is an Iowa. It's a state tax credit and it is a tax credit. And then the urban revitalization tax exemption is also a state program that the city participates in that offsets the increase in value, some of the increase in value of that property once these are built over for a period of. And it is a great, has been a great incentive project for the, you know, option for the city of Davenport. It's helped in many, many restoration of our neighborhood to certainly this part of neighborhood of Davenport sorely needs this. So I'm really excited to see this block. It's somewhat finished and I think it'll be beautiful when it's done. Thank you for letting me speak. Thank you, honorable McGinnis. Is there anyone else from council? All right, Alderman Grip, will you please set the agenda? I make a motion to place all four items on the consent agenda. Second. I have a motion and a second. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

Is there anyone in the public wishing to comment on these items? Please step to the podium, name, order, address, and then if you'd like to Gary Eckland I'm going to try to be brief, and I'm already hated enough by enough people. I don't care. Speaking out against the air show is kind of like criticizing the apple pie. I do like apple pie. However, I have also worked every shift, third shift, second shift, first shift, in between shifts, split shifts. So on the air show brings an incredible amount of noise, not to mention climate changing pollution, which is completely unnecessary. And the city has noise ordinances. I used to live in a street where I would regularly see mostly teenage black kids pulled over for having their radios up too loud, and I don't like loud radios on my street either. But somehow there's other institutions and entities that were allowed to make lots and lots of noise and never get in trouble. I've been calling about my neighbors recently and was just talking to the police chief tonight about noise. This air show, if it's as loud as it usually is, means that there are people who work third shift or second shift or split shift who will not get sleep for that weekend. And you know, a lot of people work first shift and that's good for them. But the other people deserve an opportunity to sleep. And personally, I wish we'd shut the air show down. I wish we would shut the downport airport down. We already have the Moline airport, and the taxpayers subsidize all of this so this is my expression against the noise and the climate change killing airport. Thank you. Anyone else wishing to comment on either of those items? Anyone from council seeing none, that item will move on. Item number two, motion approving noise variance requests on the list of dates and times for outdoor events. I'll read these before asking for comment. First, QC Pride Quad Cities Unity Pride Parade downtown with the parade route attached online 11:00 a.m. 12:30 p.m. saturday, June 1, 2024.

Outdoor music over 50 dBa. Is there anyone from public wishing to comment on these items? Anyone from council seeing none that item move on. Item number three, motion approving beer and liquor license applications. I'll read those under section a. New license, new owner temporary permit temporary outdoor area location transfer, etcetera. First RME Courtyard, 121 West Second street temporary extended outdoor area June 7 license type, class C liquor and next double D diner, 22 25 West 53rd street number 400, new license slash owner license type, class C liquor on premises. There are those items under section B, annual license renewals, which I will not read. However, I will make a note of the return for the 11th street precinct item which was tabled a couple cycles ago. And before I go to comment, I would just take a point of privilege just to ask our interim city administrator, Miss Merritt to make comments on that 11th street precinct item, please. Yes. Thank you, Alderman Jobjin. At this time, the staff no longer recommends denial of this item. It's our understanding that the owner has complied with the code requirements that are in place so you can delete that recommendation for denial. And it would be the staff's recommendation to move forward from a process perspective. Thank you very much. Is there anyone from the public wishing to comment on any of these items? Anyone from council Alderman Kelly, thank you. I want to apologize for the other day when I contacted you with the way the lines are drawn between me and you. Seven dips in and out. I just don't understand why I enforce in my neighborhood, how I don't need new liquor licenses and the rest of us do not because there's a new liquor license that I paid attention is like 20ft from hy Vee's liquor store on Kimberly Road that I was like, whoa, what? What is this? If that's what folks think of us as quad citians, Aak, Davenport, Iowans. That we need the liquor store on every single corner. To me, that's a problem. So I pay attention to stuff like that. And I know that may sound crazy, but it's just like, how many liquor stores do we need in Davenport? Let's start putting some in the 6th, out in the 6th ward, all over, up and down Jersey Ridge and Elmore. Let's see what you guys think. No offense, but I'm just like, how many do we need? It's starting to be really oversaturated. I think we need to pay more attention to when these folks are applying for these liquor licenses. Thank you. Anyone else from council seeing no one else, I would ask Alderman Tim Dunn, please set our agenda. Make a motion to move all items of public safety to the consent agenda. We have a motion. A second. All in favor? Aye. All opposed? Same sign that closes public safety. Back to you, mister mayor. Thank you, Alderman Jobson. Next series, public works. Alderman Rick Dunn and Alderman Kelly will discuss. Alderman Rick Dunn, please. Thank you, your honor.

Item number one is a resolution accepting the work completed under the modern wooden park fire suppression replacement project by the Henley group, and the amount of $1,035,320. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Good evening. Dale Gilmore, 6th ward. I would just like to ask that this item be put on the discussion agenda for next week. Give me a week, and God willing, I'll be here. So I'd like to talk about that. Thank you. McConaughey Dixon, 7th Ward. I would just like to point out that this modern whitman stadium has just now been voted the best. So this is very much so. An asset to the area. And would it be an asset to the area? Of course, you need the items to make the place safe. So I hope that you guys will not table this item and let's move forward and let's continue being the best and one of the best parts of being in the Quad Cities. Thank you. Anyone else? Anyone council seeing them? This item will move on. Item number two is a resolution approving change order number five in the amount of $317,550. Federal state cost share of 214,589 and the city share of 102,961. The five cities construction company for the flood mitigation project at West River Drive in Marquette street. And before I ask for public with commentary, can we have director Merritt come up and explain what the change orders were? Clay Merritt, engineering and capital projects. So this particular project is one of our key flood mitigation projects. In order to perform it, we need to do, we need to reconfigure the existing storm sewer system that is in that particular intersection specifically for this particular piece. It's the northwest corner. We are actually reconstructing an existing manhole, building a new one, and there's about three or four different lines that converge on the existing manhole. So we're going to separate those and put in some control points so we can essentially stop floodwaters from coming up from underneath the storm sewer system, which is. Which really cause it at this day and time to flood it out. So we want to eliminate so we can keep it open for longer during probably around river stage 1414 and a half as well. What happens now? We want to keep it open till around river stage 18. The change order in particular is during construction, we ran into some nearby, there's an old contaminated site and some oily water. We have a particular line item within our contract to handle this so that we're filtering it properly before putting it back into the system. We've ran into more than what the engineer was anticipating. So this change order is to increase that line item and put a cap on it so if we run into any more, we can continually filter it and do so properly before putting it back into the system. As noted in the green sheet, we do have a federal and state grant a part of this project. In total, federal and state share cost shares by $1.7 million project 1.4 of it is from federal and state and about 300,000. And that includes this particular change order is from the city. And then once again, that breakdown of the change order itself is listed as Alderman Dunn Read, so I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you. Anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Council seeing on this item, we'll move on. Item number three is the resolution exercising the second year option and awarding a one year continuation of the FY 2023 contract sewer repair program to Hagerty earthworks, hometown Mechanical, Peterson Plumbing, in the amount of $250,000 each. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Gary Aiklan. I'll be very super brief. I am here for various reasons. You know that. However, every time the sewer comes up, I can only think about how the sewer bills were created in order to put more money in the pocket of the city of Davenport and increase. Few things make it more unaffordable for poor people to have housing in the city of Davenport than the sewer bills it's time. As you constantly pass bills regarding the sewer program, it's time to put a pan in place to make this the last year that there is a separate sewer bill and that the sewer and garbage bills go back on the property tax rolls. As it was for years before city staff and some city council got it in their head that they could have a lot more money for higher wages for city. Mister Eklund, this is for repairing the sewer pipes. So please, I do apologize. I've already went on far longer than I meant to. But every time I see the sewer bill, all I can think about is how it is funded and it should be funded more equitably. It used to be on the property tax rolls and it could easily be put pack on the property tax rolls and it would instantly make housing more affordable for a lot of people. Thank you. Anyone else? Counsel, seeing none of this item, we'll move on.

Tonight, I and alderwoman Burkholder will discuss finance. Number one, a resolution making provision for the issuance of not to exceed 31 million general obligation corporate bonds, series 2025. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Is there anyone from council alder. Woodman mcGinnis. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman. We could ask interim city manager Merritt. Miss Merritt, could you explain the amount, the process, and where we are in this part of the sequence? Sure. Thank you. This is very early for us in terms of the FY 25 bond sale. The actual sale will not occur until sometime next year, late winter or spring. So for right now, you'll read that this is just the making of the provision to enter into the sale. This is not the actual sale. So the budget that was approved for FY 25 included, I think it was about $28.5 million in a bond issuance. It's typical for us to build in a margin at this point, given that we have not even entered into FY 25 yet. So you can view this as a safety net. This would allow that if something were to come up as we start to proceed through the year that the council would have a manner to pay for it, although I do not anticipate that to occur again. It's just a safety net. The actual sale amount will be determined next year as we get closer to that actual sale time. Thank you. Anyone else from council? All right, seeing on, we move on to item number two. This is a resolution awarding a temporary corporation counsel and operational legal services contract to Layne and Waterman LLP of Davenport, Iowa, in the amount not to exceed 135,000 through September of 2024, and authorizing two possible one month renewals thereafter in the amount of 30,000 per month. Prior to taking comment from the public, I would ask that at interim city administrator merit, please explain the process, how we got to here, and if there were any other bids that we received during the process. Sure. Thank you, madam chair. Again, I contacted about seven firms, and the purpose of that was to compare rate structure, service models, and contract models.

Thanks, everybody, for coming to the April Riverfront Improvement Commission meeting. I will go ahead. So we have the minutes in your packet here. I'm looking for a motion to approve the march minutes. Do I motion approve minutes? Show approved. Show moved. Second. All right, one motion. Second. Any discussion? All those in favor of approving the march minutes, say aye. Any opposed? No exchange. Excellent. Go ahead and approve those minutes. Next up, visit club. Are we supposed to have somebody here, or is this kind of staff discussion? Yep, it will be staff discussion. So, after our meeting, our last meeting, one of the steps that we did was we actually met with director Dyson and Zach Peterson, got them both together in the room to kind of talk through what their thoughts were, and I wanted to share some of the feedback that they gave me. And then we actually set up a meeting with Dave and his team, and they gave this feedback to Dave and his team as well. So some of the thoughts that. The initial thoughts that they had were, they like the sign. They think the sign is very cool. They like the idea behind it. However, one of the things that they were both pretty adamant about is that they're not 100% sold that this sign design is the right design for River Heritage park. If you look at River Heritage park, the design and the overall topography of the park is really a bit more historic. And so this sign design is a bit more flashy. That's okay. But doesn't necessarily meet the quality of the park that they're trying to continue to develop there. So that was really their first comment back, the second comment back that actually both Zach and Laura provided to us. Laura, she. I apologize. I don't have her full title in front of me, but Laura really manages quite a bit of our code and enforcement. And so she was also at that meeting, and she had shared with me that because it is, in fact, in a floodplain, it absolutely needs to be bolted into the ground and engineerly bolted into the ground. So that was something that, if you remember, Dave was kind of like, oh, this sign can, you know, you can just pick it up and move it. And so, to their point, after kind of really looking through that, that model wouldn't necessarily fit this particular location. So, in further discussion with both Laura and Chad and Zach, one of the things that they suggested was they really think that this sign would actually be a better fit for somewhere in Main street landing. So as Main street landing continues to be developed, this sign, the design elements, the components of it, the picture worthy photographics, this would be a better fit within Main street landing. So they would like to recommend that this be tabled for the time being, and that as we continue to develop Main street landing, that this then be looked at again and then incorporated into that development and design. So after. So, like I said, they kind of shared that with me. We then had a meeting with Dave and his team to talk through that. One of the. I would say one of the ideas that director Dyson then pitched to Dave and his team, just saying that if they are very passionate about putting this type of sign in River Heritage park, that he would challenge them with. With actually changing the base of it a little bit. So the design element of the base. So if you look at it, it doesn't necessarily match the design elements that are currently created within river heritage. And so if they would be willing to change any of those design elements to better meet the needs of the park, that they would reconsider that. But I think after that meeting, it was agreed that they would be very interested in finding a space and Main street landing for this sign if and when we get to that point. So that is where we kind of left that off. Does anyone have any questions? Yeah. One of the points that they made when they were presenting this was where the tour boats, you know, kind of leave passengers off. Is that an opportunity in Main street landing also, or is that a little more removed from the. From the. I would say Main street landing is a bit more removed. It doesn't mean that visitors wouldn't be able to go to Main street landing when they do dock, but they will not be able to dock in Main street landing. So they are or they are not thinking of still putting one in River Heritage park at this time. They are not visit quad cities in discussion with director Dyson, as Zach and Laura. Does that fall under the purpose of design? Yes. So there are many, many review boards that this would need to go to. Yep. So you bring up a really good point. So, really we wanted to bring it here to see if it would even be of interest. Right. Like, is this something that we are even interested in? It would then go to design review board and then, honestly, it would need to go to council.

So, really we wanted to bring it here to see if it would even be of interest. Right. Like, is this something that we are even interested in? It would then go to design review board and then, honestly, it would need to go to council. So that type of sign, we always have to be, I would just say, conscious of putting signs other than the city of Davenport, within the city of Davenport. And so that's something that we really reevaluate and take great consideration in. But also a main street landing would also have to go through them as well. Right. It would so are they going back to the drawing board, or are they? I think for right now, they're going to table it and wait for further development and design with Main street landing. That's really what I think we're currently waiting on is further development for Main street landing. As they get to a point where they feel, okay, this is the right time to implement signage overall as part of the larger design. That's when they will invite them back to the table to have that discussion of where it could be placed, how large it actually needs to be. They gave us some ideas of sizing, but at the end of the day, we would really want to think about that from a holistic perspective and then actually thinking about a secure location to where it could be engineered and bolted into the ground as best as possible. What if they could make a trailer out of it? What do you mean? Like the existing designs, metal, put it on wheels, tow it behind their named car that I forget the name of, bring it to every event in the Quad Cities, including the boat launch, the boat landings, and then take it away. Which solves almost all of those issues other than the look of historic riverfront. But, I mean, the current plastic signage they've been sticking in the ground to welcome the boat visitors is certainly not passing design review either. So just throwing it out there, I mean, it's not for you. It's more for Dave, but it seems like that's a cost effective way. They could take it to East Moline, you know, East Village, Rock island. Are they using it? Do they want to use the sign in other cities? Did they say they. They do want to place the same sign in all of the Quad Cities? Does it exist in that park right now? It is not. That's in Rock island, obviously. That's correct. This would be the first place. So it actually. Yes. They said they were in talks with TBK for the buttplex or something, but there isn't one anywhere currently. But I got the impression that while they thought of it as portable, it wasn't like once a week they'd move. No, I think they were going to bolt it down. Otherwise, scrappers would take it the first night, but it would be more like seasonal. That they would move it to another who is under the jurisdiction of the collective identity or logo of the Quad Cities. That doesn't really exist. This is the logo of the visitor center. And, you know, something like that would need a lot more collaboration between all the participating entities to make something that would be uniform. That's a good point. Is there somebody that's in charge of that. I would think that would be a bi state thing. The last thing we did was signage, and everybody got a color. Yes. And that took three or four years in the making, didn't last. Yeah, yeah. But I would think that's. It's a regional planning agency. That's where everyone is. I think if you asked visit Quad Cities, they would say they decided the brand of the Quad Cities, which is why I'm just saying what visiquad cities would say. And they might be. I don't know. So do they kind of have any marching orders, or is it just kind of like a. We're kind of just temporarily waiting for Main street landing and how that shapes up? So Director Dyson asked at this time for them to table the idea until Main street landing is further developed. And then at that time, director Dyson will reach out to me and let me know, like, hey, if we can bring them back to the table for further discussion at that point. But, yeah, but I think Main street landing is being designed right now. It is. They're just not at a point where they're ready to implement signage. So that's why Director Dyson had asked them to table it. Okay, and what does that. When do we break ground on that? So the hope, I believe the hope is this fall, but I think that's actually probably a good idea to maybe ask Dyson if he would be willing to come by sometime and give us all an update on where we're at with that. Yes, that would be good. Who's managing that? So we actually have Clay Barrett, he is our director of capital improvement project over at works, and then Chad Dyson, the director of parks and recreation, and then Zach Peterson, who is our city landscape architect. He's a good group. Excellent. Up next, focus groups. So I'm not trying to put our people on this spot, but I really would like to give you an opportunity to just share with the group what we heard from the focus groups. I will just say that I found them to be extremely valuable. I was so impressed, and it was really fun. So great time.

So we met on April 12, Gwendolyn and I and Stephanie and Courtney, along with Kent Pilcher Avesta's company, and Kyle Carter of the downtown partnership. So they kind of led the conversation, and we listened, and Stephanie took great notes, of which I have them. There were some. I mean, there were a lot of point interest and things. So we asked them what would, you know, what would make their business better, what would be a customer focused thing that we could do. What could allow them either to make more money or make it easily, more easily, and what are the things that they need? And of course, we first looked at the building. So when we started with the farmers market, their interest, and I think the commission knows it, is the power and flurry and quin lot for the Saturday market. It was in our CIP, and it actually was funded and then was taken out because the freight house needs a roof and a number of other things. And as a commission, we looked at it and said, of all things, we have to be a landlord first. And these needs are greater, but they're still interested in that. And they really discussed of all the power needs they need for that Saturday. So that was kind of their first issue. And then they moved to kind of like on the wish list, which is they would like to be able to upgrade the stage in the stage area, maybe make it more three season. So there's a lot of things that go along with that. Once you have that concept and you're thinking about it. The other thing is that, you know, they're very vendor customer focused, so very vendor focused. So they're very interested in the empty restaurant next door for a market for like a grocery store market for their vendors during the week and maybe for programming and some other things. Not necessarily would it be like something that would open at ten in the morning and be open till six in the evening, but it would be something that would help their vendors sell produce during the week or bake goods or whatever. And then they also thought it would be a great grocery store for the Palmer students. And I thought about that afterwards, and I realized, you know, when greatest grains left Harrison Palmer, they got a hole, a big hole for the Palmer students, because that kind of place is like you go to, you know, natural brochure. I mean, you really gotta go for that kind of food. So that was one of their major interests. But they have issues that, as a landlord, we have to think about. They have electrical issues, they have storage issues, they have window issues, they have issues with the building. So we have to recognize that and figure out how we put that in. Then we went next door and we talked to Front street, and, you know, Front Street's first thing was, we just need businesses with food. You know, they're trying to do food kind of like over a Bunsen burner, literally, to have something there for their tenants. I think they're doing very well. They also, you know, want something where the front street person can kind of go through all the building, and they all kind of recognize that it would be nice that whatever happens and continues to happen, that you can walk tinellas, you can walk to Front street, you can walk through the whole front, through the building. It's not locked off because that business is closed. And we have that now with the empty space. And we had that really with chill. It was what you couldn't get through to the restaurant. They have some issues. I think some of it's electrical. I mean, they have some. I think one of all the tenants talk to us about electrical issues. You know, up in the diner, they can't really have a commercial. They feel like a commercial kitchen because the outlets, they can't plug things in. We heard that from Antonella's. You know, you can't plug in a flyer. You'll blow it. You know, you'll blow a transformer or something, you know, a fuse. And if there's no fuses, you hit the switch. But. So they had those issues. So there are some. There are building issues, but I think they're very happy being there. They would like to see signage some way that says, this is where we are. And I think we've been hearing that from the freight house for quite some time. I think one of the things that Front street said that I think we got to take note of is that they said we are a destination. We're not part of the downtown. People come to the freight house because they come to the freight house. They're just not downtown. Slipping over to the freight house. They might be wrong about me. I usually go to the freight house after a meeting like this, but because I'm downtown. But that's basically what they're saying, that, you know, they're on their own there and they're doing well, but they would like a little bit more representation. And you could kind of get a sense of. I think we all got a sense of that, you know, all those things happening down on Main street.

I think one of the things that Front street said that I think we got to take note of is that they said we are a destination. We're not part of the downtown. People come to the freight house because they come to the freight house. They're just not downtown. Slipping over to the freight house. They might be wrong about me. I usually go to the freight house after a meeting like this, but because I'm downtown. But that's basically what they're saying, that, you know, they're on their own there and they're doing well, but they would like a little bit more representation. And you could kind of get a sense of. I think we all got a sense of that, you know, all those things happening down on Main street. But, you know, one of their issues, especially front street and Antonella, is that their bathroom that they share is a public bathroom. It's not a business bathroom for the public. It's a public bathroom, and it gets treated as such. And we really got to think about. And even the farmer's market said, we need more outdoor potties. We need porta potties or permanent bathrooms that are public, that are on the outside. So these are kind of from this focus group. We're going to probably work on these kind of concepts that kind of meld together. So there is a huge issue, you know, and there was just little things like the concrete's really slick. If it's wet, you can fall going into the bathroom, which I did notice when we were there, but never before. And there's some aging things for Antonio's. There's a floor. All the big air conditioning tubes drip on the customer. They have window issues, they have electrical issues. So we moved on then to the diner. The diner has some special, I think, situation. Their bathroom is, really needs to be. Their bathrooms need to be upgraded. They have a big window in one of the women's stalls and it's got a curtain now. It doesn't. So you just kind of look out and others are looking in. That's one thing that with the new apartments across the way, they can kind of, it's like you can see back and forth now. So that's a bit of an issue. Their flooring is a problem. The carpeting going up the steps is old and is a problem. They have huge electrical problems in the kitchen and they have some other things that they like to have done. Their facility doesn't work because the elevators downstairs and there's a lot of space there. But they did have an interesting idea either for them or for another tenant, is that if we had water there, they could like have a setup bar, which you could wait for your table because they get slammed. You could wait. You could have a drink. There is a lot of room. I mean, they have a partition up, but there is a lot of room on that first floor. Not enough for its own standalone business, but for a way, if you could figure out how to make that work, it would be a benefit. And they also thought a benefit would be kind of extending the deck underneath the patio, which is a big area to have more outside seating because they use, everybody uses the seating. So I think that was the major issues. Right. We told them all about what we're doing in terms of, I was a landlord of the roof, windows and tuck pointing and all these things that are coming, but we wanted to figure out what else we need to think about. And so that was it. There was a little like, we'd like to have employee parking and is there a way to like. Maybe we even talked about putting it on river Drive for them because there's this huge area out there that's kind of no man's land and you really can't landscape it. So that was one of it. So the last people that we talked to were taste of Ethiopia. And when you go into their location, I mean, you can tell that that rotten remodel is much more recent. It's much more stylish. It's very small. So their internal needs, they really don't. I mean, they did not express a lot of internal needs. They did have handicapped parking, how to get to the building, because the back is the security, because where you come in on the backside of River Drive, it's kind of hard. They wanted more seating. The whole idea, if we could figure out how to do this patio on deck and make that all happen for them, it would be a real plus. Everything else was rather minor, didn't you think? Very minor. So what I think is happening next is we're going to meet in May, the group, and then we're going to take these ideas and kind of break them out. Look at the schive Hattery study of 2018 that talked about some of the building inadequacies, highlight those kind of what would pertain to the internal workings of the businesses, and kind of come back with some estimated ideas and some estimated costs that we could then ponder for future projects. And, you know, I think the good thing that happened is that there's some things that maybe we can capitalize on. The idea of some kind of signage or some entranceway arch that takes you into Ripley street for the freight house that's on River Drive, a lot of small districts or neighborhoods, and I think we're going to get another one in the downtown. Is that a possibility that, you know, that you've arrived, that, you know, that's where it is? They did, you know, they did say that there's a lot of needs, and they feel like the LeClaire park side of the Riverfront has totally been forgotten. And that's where, you know, people come for festivals. That's where we try to do a lot of things, and that's not the focus. So, I mean, they all express that in one regard or another. So I think that. Did I summarize anything to add? Yeah. Great. Yeah. And we talked about the archway. So downtown Davenport is currently doing some alley archway projects. And so we're starting on, I think, Emerson Place, and then so there's, it's kind of about activating. And so it seemed like there would be some nice synergies with some kind of place making down, kind of going into that district with other things th", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Front

So I think that. Did I summarize anything to add? Yeah. Great. Yeah. And we talked about the archway. So downtown Davenport is currently doing some alley archway projects. And so we're starting on, I think, Emerson Place, and then so there's, it's kind of about activating. And so it seemed like there would be some nice synergies with some kind of place making down, kind of going into that district with other things that are happening and already approved going on in downtown within the next. I think there's maybe two or three that are happening this year and maybe another one or two on the docket for next year and then. But the ampbridge, just that building, you know, so I don't know what, whether that's like a, we get with med american or that's something that Kent does with estimates, but yeah, yeah, it's obviously under juiced at that building. And that's, that would be no small cost, you know, to up that go in there. So that was one thing that we just kind of heard over and over again is just basically things being underpowered or having to, you know, pick and choose which, you know, whatever, you know, blender or stove that they're going to be running. So that was interesting. Just was a unifying theme from all the tenants. Yeah. And I think for us, the building, the business that is closed now, this section, and who we're looking for as a tenant and who wants to be tenant is one we're going to have to discuss. I mean, the farmer's market really wants that building. They really want that space. And they were very, they're very crystal clear on what they would use it for. I just. We got to decide if that's the highest and best use for the rest of the tenants. That's why I was going to ask, as you're giving your report, is what's, what's the vision, our vision for the use of those buildings, like long term. I mean, we just happy that we have someone who's, who's leasing them or do we have a. A goal in mind because we don't want to spend money doing upgrades for the tenants today if they're not the tenants that we want tomorrow. And I don't, I guess, I don't know what the be new. I don't know what the vision is for those properties, but we need to have that. No, I'll try to express mine. I think over time, we've been a very neglected, we've neglected them as a landlord. We haven't done what we needed to do. And we weren't getting very good rents, but we're getting better rents. But I think what it is is total activation of that building in a commercial sense. It's, you know, to be able to have people feel comfortable coming down, doing business and feeling like they've had a good time. And I see what we've done with Union Station, with the taste of Ethiopia is to have a piece of that that's not asleep after 05:00. I mean, that's often useless and not seasonal. Right. That's my concerns with the farmer's market is it's a seasonal gig. There are indoor facilities there that go year round, right? Smaller degree, but yes. And they were pretty honest. They talking about, like, their vendors can't be there every day with baked goods. That's not how their vendors work. They can't do that kind of thing. They can do it a couple of times a week. So I think, you know, and they have an extent of how many vendors they have. So I think the market, that's what we have to really think about it. Is it activating a square footage even though they say they'll pay the rent? Is that really getting the kind of return on investment? And I don't mean our investment as in money, but the building and everyone else's investment in return. Are they getting enough customers? And the customers are having great experience throughout the facility. Well, that's interesting. To your point. It's like, it's the bigger vision. I mean, if that's an experiential place, what things would we ideally like to have there? And if it's, let's say, two or three restaurants, that is a long list of requirements to be able to operate a restaurant without just a panini breast, you know, in those spaces. And if you have that vision, then we say, okay, it may, you could rent it out to someone else who doesn't use that. But you have that infrastructure. And, you know, I'm all about the farmer's market, but I think there's a variety of solutions to activate the farmer's market in ways that are multi seasonal, that, of course, everything takes money. But, you know, I think it's a question to your point, of the building itself, that physical property, what is the strategy there? When we say activation past 05:00 p.m. what does that look like? What I thought was interesting, the ice thing, the ice sculpture that we have, like those programming things, which actually the farmers market helps and other people help. The return to those businesses is like a $10,000 day. That's a huge return. And in return for us, we have like a program that our families can come down and experience. It's like a half park and rec. Half businesses are making money. I think that's kind of where we are with the freight house. It's like, how do we have these activities that make you feel that that park, and I live in Davenport, I can come here with my family or not, and everyone's doing good, doing well, you know, making money or having a good time. And some things are irrespective, right? I mean, the roof, the paraport, having proper utility, feeding, the building. Right.

"text": "your point, of the building itself, that physical property, what is the strategy there? When we say activation past 05:00 p.m. what does that look like? What I thought was interesting, the ice thing, the ice sculpture that we have, like those programming things, which actually the farmers market helps and other people help. The return to those businesses is like a $10,000 day. That's a huge return. And in return for us, we have like a program that our families can come down and experience. It's like a half park and rec. Half businesses are making money. I think that's kind of where we are with the freight house. It's like, how do we have these activities that make you feel that that park, and I live in Davenport, I can come here with my family or not, and everyone's doing good, doing well, you know, making money or having a good time. And some things are irrespective, right? I mean, the roof, the paraport, having proper utility, feeding, the building. Right. So there's some things that doesn't really matter what we're going to do with it long term. And so those are first priorities and go from there. So is that something we need to discuss? I think that's a good idea. Yeah, I really do. I think that. I think we have a good handle on the focus group component and seeing that through, finishing that part out to help us figure out even from just a building maintenance perspective. Right. Like, no matter what, at the end of the day, we're still going to need to improve our electrical. Right. And so from a building maintenance perspective, that will help us continue to move forward on producing quality, capital improvement and bathrooms. That's a major issue. Yep. To submit, but as a. So that's one part. Right. But then even Steph and I have talked a little bit about this, too. I think kind of a subcategory is kind of touching on what Andrea and Dan have talked about. And actually, to Kelly's credit, I know she's not here, but she has brought that exact thing up as well many times. And so I think. Right. Like, we have two kind of components, and I think as a. As a group, if we could start working through that component as well, while also thinking about, you know, I would just throw out there thinking about the whole riverfront, too. Right. And not just necessarily the freight house. I loved what Dee had brought up to even about, like, Leclaire Park. I think that's even, like, a sub project that we could be working on with parks and recreation and the development of Leclaire park. And how do we marry that long term to Main street landing. Right. That's really like a partnership. So I don't know if what would be helpful from. From our end, but we could even, Steph and I could even start thinking about some subcategories to consider and try to work through over the next year. So our immediate issue, more or less, is to decide whether we want to let the farmer's market take over that space or have another rental in that space. Isn't that right? Is that what we're talking about? Well, that's something that the staff. I mean, it's available almost soon. It is available, but what I would say is we are still waiting on their proposal. We have not received their proposal yet. I know that Missy had come and talked to the group about submitting a proposal. So I would ask Stephanie to take the lead and reaching out to Missy and asking for their proposal. I think really, that's the first step, is getting that proposal in hand to truly understand in writing what it is that they want to accomplish, and then we can kind of go from there. Did you hear anything from Front street about the hours of Antonella's in the diner? I mean, there already are two restaurants. Let's just. They did, they were very tasteful, and they said that they would like to have businesses that have hours that they can rely on. And I think one of the issues is that we still have businesses that have more seasonal business. When it's warm out, they can. They'll staff up and they'll make money. If it's called out, they'll lose money, and so they might not staff. And so that is part, I think that's part of the issue. And how do we make that a little bit more reliable? And, you know, with the diner, it's, you know, the hours that they have now. They're thinking about openings Friday and Saturday nights, which will be a huge difference in terms of people. I mean, when they wait, there's long waits. And when Antonella gets slammed, it's a huge slam. I mean, people wait 45 minutes to an hour for a pizza. So it would be nice to have yet one more business that could serve food there. Well, I think one other thing worth mentioning, Front street did say, you know, if a business came in or if one of the existing restaurants had more consistent hours earlier, Front street would be willing to adjust when they're open to extend their hours as long as, you know, there was somebody else that was open. I think it's. It's hard when you're, when you don't have food, it's hard to think about opening before 03:00 with alcohol. It's just maybe not the clientele you really want during the other part of the day. Right. Unless, you know, maybe taking a beer class or something. But meanwhile, we can put some light refracting film in the women's bathroom and spend $100 in ten minutes and put tick mark in the one column. I mean, that should be addressed. I mean, that's easy, right? I mean, yeah. So you bring up a really good point, Dan. Is there. Yeah, there were some really good conversations that came from having an in person conversation that were quick. And I don't mean to say quick fixes. I mean, things that we have the capability to do in house from a facility's maintenance standpoint. So, you know, just to bring one of those things to light, there is, behind front street, there is, like, this fence, and apparently, like, within the fence, oftentimes they might find people who don't belong in that area.

And also, it has become an area where, like, trash has just kind of gathered. And so after we heard that, we didn't. Honestly, we didn't know that. And so it wasn't until we heard that that Steph and I started talking. We're like, let's call facilities maintenance. And then our facilities maintenance team was like, we'd love to take that fence down. We'd love to clean that space up. And so we already have a date set in mid May for our team to go down there and clean through that and also have our tenants participate in that, to gather, you know, whatever belongs to them so that we can clean out that space. So I think a lot of things like that. Is there a purpose for that fence? Not that we're aware of. I think it's just kind of been, like, a general storage area. But even in talking to the tenants, a lot of them were like, I think there's things that are back there from maybe, like, previous tenants that they didn't take when they left. And so those things are just accumulating. Raccoons are apparently accumulating in that area as well, and so they have some storage issues. Yeah. Yeah. But, yeah, that's not the place. I just figured there was a transformer behind there or something. Dumpsters. That's never where their dumpsters were. No, no, never. Yeah, it's an ugly fence. Yeah. The city picks up their garbage. Yeah. So I think some takeaways from this would be to reach out to Missy to get her proposal, continue to move forward, then with our focus groups, and then maybe Steph and I can start outlining some different focus areas that we would propose for the commission to talk about. That's really what we're here for, is to just kind of help you guys have those conversations, but we want you to have them and lead them and give us direction on what to do next so we can do that forward. Thanks, everybody. All right, up next, do we have any new business? So, speaking of, are you aware of things like the fence, the tent, campers in the woods west of Veterans park? Are you aware of. Our parks department is on that. Okay. Have you seen that recently? That was some time ago when they were there, and I think they've been. A couple weeks ago. Just a couple weeks ago. They're back. Yeah. We're gonna always come back, walk the bike trail, and they were there. Yeah. Okay. Some nice day. Yeah. That's. Cause we're gonna start having some events there in May. So we really don't want them there. Any more discussion about Lindsey park and the marina and any feedback from Mallory. So I haven't. I haven't. He's talking about Mallory Bagby, just to be clear. So we haven't been able to work through that with Mallory Bagby, but we are working through it with Brian Heyer, and that might be a sub meeting separate from this that we can touch base with you on. You did say what it's about or just. We certainly can. So about, I would say about a year ago, maybe even a little bit longer, I was reached out to by Scott Clements. I was like Scott Clements over with the yacht club. And at that time, he had asked about raising rates. And you might. You can go ahead and kind of correct me as we need to. But he had reached out about raising rates, which they are able to do so per their agreement. There's nothing in their agreement that prohibits them from raising rates with their tenants, if you will. So for the slips. Yes. And so at that time, I had spoken with Tom, who had evaluated the lease at that time and had given me direction that there was nothing in their lease that prohibits them from doing that. Since then, Dan has. If you want to, kind of. Yeah. So the issue is, for years, the places need dredged out. And I sat on the board as a vice commodore for a while. I was like, well, we can't raise the lease, the slip lease rate when we know people are unhappy, the fact that it needs to be dredged out. So we knew once we got final full dredging done, they were going to be raised for that. And that happened, which is fine. What they also did is they assessed everyone who has a slip membership fee for the yacht club. And that's never been done before. It's always been very specific that either two separate legal financial entities. Right? So you have the yacht club, which sits on Davenport properties, lease to them, and it's a private club. They have a management agreement to manage the municipal, the city's marina. But it's the city's marina that's not leased to them. There's just a management agreement. So as always, you don't have to be a member of the yacht club. You don't have to be a member of a private club in order to have your boat in the city's marina. And so they. And now you do. Right. So they raised the slip fee a certain amount after the dredging was done, and then they raised everyone's slip fee, an additional $425 or whatever the membership is, and now your membership is included and, or you are now required to be a member of a private club in order to have your boat in the city's marina?

And that's never been done before. It's always been very specific that either two separate legal financial entities. Right? So you have the yacht club, which sits on Davenport properties, lease to them, and it's a private club. They have a management agreement to manage the municipal, the city's marina. But it's the city's marina that's not leased to them. There's just a management agreement. So as always, you don't have to be a member of the yacht club. You don't have to be a member of a private club in order to have your boat in the city's marina. And so they. And now you do. Right. So they raised the slip fee a certain amount after the dredging was done, and then they raised everyone's slip fee, an additional $425 or whatever the membership is, and now your membership is included and, or you are now required to be a member of a private club in order to have your boat in the city's marina? You are, yes. And that's been brought up by a few boaters that they don't think it's right. Some of them, it's not an issue if you're a member of the club anyhow. But they still don't think it's right because there's some boaters, especially in the smaller boat slips, where they get a couple thousand dollars because they want to have their boat in the water all the time because they use a lot, but they don't have another $500 to be also a member of the yacht club, especially if they don't use the yacht club. So, but it's really kind of a, more of a. Is that the right practice or to force people in order to use the city's marina, forcing them to be a member of a private club? And so that's what we've now gone back to legal to ask them to review that practice. I think that's a fair question. So that's what that's all about. Joe, do we have any say in that, in any way, shape or form? We might. We might not. I'd have to ask legal if we do or don't. Previously, the legal advice given to me when the question was asked was, can they? And I don't know. I'd have to go back and look down at the exact wording because I want. Right. It all depends on the exact wording that was given. And so I want to say that the exact wording at the time didn't say that they were required to become a private club member. I believe that the exact wording referenced that it was included, but you were not required to, that no matter what. At the end of the day, they were going to raise the, the rates were going to be raised, was my understanding. So I just want to be, if you read the verbiage, it says they will have all the benefits of the club and, and the benefit of being able to vote for board members. Right. Well, according to their bylaws, then you cannot vote for board members, unless, of course, you are a member. So then it is therefore requiring you to be a member or, or you wouldn't have the privilege of voting. Right. So I think, I think that's where we're actually at. That's actually saying there we're including membership. It's saying we're including all the benefits of a member to include voting, which then, therefore you're a member. And I showed up, they didn't even ask when the last time I was there. They're like, oh, here's your membership card, where I haven't been a member for the last couple years. So, I mean, so it wasn't a, you get the benefits, you may or may not be a member. It's you're a member, and here's your card. Well, that's going to be legal to sort out. I think our next stop is when, if we don't like it, it's when these leases come due, if we want to change them. But I think we're really on the sideline right now until it gets interpreted. The lease of. What do you mean when the lease comes due? I think we have ground leases, don't we? We do have a lease with them, sure. But it's a pretty long term. It is, but it can be reevaluated, right? I think the management agreement was like a hundred year agreement made back, you know, 40 years ago or whatever. So, yes, it's a long term agreement, but certainly it can be reevaluated. I feel like we got off pretty well because they had to do. There was one time a few years ago, I was speaking to the mayor about an issue with the yacht club, and he was like, well, why do we, you know, why should the city be concerned with what happens with a private club? So again, it's a private club, not the city's business per se, that aspect of it. And I'm like, well, it's, the city doesn't have any involvement, really, by their own doing. Right. The city, the reform proven commission, because it's the city's marina, could have more involvement, could have someone auditing the board meetings or have some involvement. There's just been a choice, probably more under the previous roles. The previous people that had your roles just didn't have that involvement. But not that there couldn't be. That's all I have. So the marine specialty's lease approval. Yes. So one thing that I just wanted to bring this up to the group. So previously we had approved, we've actually just approved the marine specialties lease about a year ago. And at that time, we raised them the 5% like we normally do. But I will say it has been customary that we have. We will raise the 5% and then we allow for a three year lease without divulging too much information. That tenant at the time had asked me if we could only do a one year lease, just given some health concerns. And so we had agreed to a one year lease as a commission. He would like to ask if we would honor that three year lease component and continue on for two more years at. At the same rate, the same 5% increase. So I would ask the commission to please consider that. I will tell you, he's a great tenant. He's great to work with, given all the construction that's going on right now on river drive. Like, Chad and his wife are fantastic. And I would just ask and hope that we could honor that lease for two more years at the same rate. And have we been doing escalators on other leases now with the 5%? Have there been, like, an annual or not? No. S", "answer_v2": "[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Davenport Properties\",\n    \"positives\": [],\n    \"negatives\": [\n      \"Forcing boaters to be members of a private yacht club to use the city's marina.\"\n    ],\n    \"decision\": \"sell\",\n    \"comment\": \"The practice of forcing boaters to become members of a private club to use the city's marina is questionable and under legal review, signaling potential future conflicts and regulatory issues.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Yacht Club (unspecified name)\",\n    \"positives\": [],\n    \"negatives\": [\n      \"Forcing boaters to be members of a private yacht club to use the city's marina.\",\n      \"Increased slip fee post-dredging and added a mandatory club membership fee.\"\n    ],\n    \"decision\": \"sell\",\n    \"comment\": \"The practice of mandating yacht club membership for marina usage is contentious and under legal scrutiny, indicating potential future instability.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Marine Specialties (tenant)\",\n    \"positives\": [\n      \"Excellent tenant with good relationship and cooperation.\",\n      \"Honors agreement terms consistently.\",\n      \"Agreed to 5% lease increase, maintains willingness to abide by terms.\"\n    ],\n    \"negatives\": [],\n    \"decision\": \"buy\",\n    \"comment\": \"The tenant shows reliability and good management, making it a solid investment option.\"\n  }\n]", "esg_v1": "[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Davenport Properties\",\n    \"insights\": [\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Forcing boaters to become members of a private yacht club to use the city's marina raises concerns among boaters, some of whom cannot afford the additional yacht club membership fee.\",\n        \"classification\": \"S\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"negative\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Review by legal department requested to assess the practice of forcing marina users to become private club members.\",\n        \"classification\": \"G\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Lack of transparency on whether membership in the yacht club is required, leading to confusion among users.\",\n        \"classification\": \"G\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"negative\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"City's consideration to have more involvement in marina management and decision-making, potentially including auditing yacht club board meetings.\",\n        \"classification\": \"G\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Marine Specialties\",\n    \"insights\": [\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Tenant requested a one-year lease due to health concerns, which was accommodated by the commission.\",\n        \"classification\": \"S\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Tenant is described as great to work with and requested to honor the lease for two additional years at the same rate.\",\n        \"classification\": \"S\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]", "esg_v2": [{"name": "Davenport Properties", "insights": [{"observation": "Forcing boaters to become members of a private yacht club to use the city's marina raises concerns among boaters, some of whom cannot afford the additional yacht club membership fee.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Review by legal department requested to assess the practice of forcing marina users to become private club members.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Lack of transparency on whether membership in the yacht club is required, leading to confusion among users.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "City's consideration to have more involvement in marina management and decision-making, potentially including auditing yacht club board meetings.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Marine Specialties", "insights": [{"observation": "Tenant requested a one-year lease due to health concerns, which was accommodated by the commission.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Tenant is described as great to work with and requested to honor the lease for two additional years at the same rate.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 2368540, "chunk_end_time": 2780004, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x134tmwXlY", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x134tmwXlY&t=2368s"}, {"start": 39000, "end": 45000, "text": "cialties lease about a year ago.

You should bring back the amendment for us to consider. All right, so you want to add two years? I would like to add two years, yes. So you bring back what we need to vote on? Yeah. Yeah, I think that makes sense. Who or what part. So who's the other tenant or us. Right. Is responsible for what part of maintenance on that property? Yep. So it depends on what part you're talking about. So his. His building, the building that Chad is in. Chad, I believe, is responsible for the maintenance of that building. There is the crane. I want to say that we are responsible for as a city, which is kind of unique. So that is ours. That's the riverfront improvement commission, and we do maintain it. I actually just paid a bill for it. And then we, as a city and a commissioner, do and need to continue to maintain the building that is next to him. So that is something I would probably add to that. Long term planning of subcategories. That's something that I would say we need to look at and consider. Is that the one that has two stories that we had? It is vegan. The guy living there we didn't know about. Yeah. So I actually didn't even know that someone lived there until right now, but I assumed it only because it looks like a living space. But we have since. Actually, that was one of the first projects that I had come into is myself and our facilities maintenance team has been three days cleaning that out, and there's nobody there now. There is no one there. It's completely winterized, completely cleaned out, locked. We check on it regularly. What about the perimeter fence? And is there a difference between three sides of the fence and the fence along the river and then the dock. I would say, dan, for that specific question, maybe you and I, we could talk about like a Google map, if you could. I'm a very visual person, so if you could maybe circle which ones you're talking about, I can then do a parcel assessment and see which parts we own, just because I want to make sure that we own that. And then look at our long term facility maintenance plan to see who manages the maintenance of the fencing. And then I could probably bring that back to our next meeting. We talk about that and that because some of the fence along the river and the dock is in rough shape. So. So we don't have anybody using that part that we own right now. Is that correct? The. The extra building? Yeah, the vacant one. No, we do not have anyone using that building at this time. Time. That's a unique situation because then that building is also within the perimeter fence, so. Yeah. And a hostage with it. Yeah. Does he own the building next door or is he just. No, no, he's a tenant. Are you talking about that building? Metal building? No, no. The metal building's owned by Dolan and he actually owns that property. The two buildings of marine specialty. The east of the two buildings, the one on the east side of the drive, as you drive in, Chad doesn't use the larger single story one on the west side of the drive. On the west side of the drive is the one that Chad runs his business out of. But we own those buildings. Yeah, yeah. The city owns all that, just not that green metal, more pole barn looking one between them and Toluva. That's owned by, is it Dan Dolan? Yeah. And that place is a mess. And I'll work with you on other topics. Excellent. Next management update. So I have two quick ones. One I wanted to share all with you. It's in the warps and so I want to be careful of it, but I also think it's important to talk about it. So. Taste of Ethiopia, I think I had shared this a few months ago. They, for many months now, have been considering retirement. They shared that with us. We actually only signed a one year lease agreement with them knowing that that was something that they were considering. They are hopeful that they have found someone to purchase their business. We are currently working through that with legal to see if this is something that can be done and then talking through it from a lease perspective. So they're interested on a number of different fronts, this new owner. So they're interested in some type of potentially a small business loan. So we're from a city perspective kind of looking at that. But then also again, just for your awareness, the lease for taste of Ethiopia does not end until, I want to say, October 31. So this would be something that potentially if they were able to sell their business, they do have a goal to sell their business by July 1. There are some options, right. And so some of the options include asking the current taste of Ethiopia owners to continue their lease until October 31. A potential option.

Does the current lease allow for a sublease or is that part what they're looking at? It is not. Yeah, we do not allow for subleasing. All right. Any questions on that one? No. Okay. And then the second one, this one's a little bit harder. But it's something that I know that those of you who have been on the commission and at least as long as I have been the liaison, have been made aware of. And so for many years now, we have been working with the diner on their lease agreement. So we come to find that they are behind on their lease a pretty substantial amount and they then find a way to make good and makes a payment on those lease. But then they seem to go back right to where they started. And so we have had a very difficult time maintaining a consistent lease payment on a regular basis. I have met with them at least since I've been here, oh, three times in person just over the last year actually to talk through that. And again, like I would tell you, I will meet with them and then I have seen substantial funds come in to make good on those payments. But then again it falls back and it falls short. So since then what we have done is we had a meeting, I would say it was two weeks ago. Two weeks ago our legal team, our assistant director of finance, myself, Stephanie and the owner of the diner all met together and talked through a plan that would make her whole and what that would require her to do from a monthly standpoint in terms of payments by the end of. And her lease I believe is October as well. I want to say it's October as well. So at the end of the day, what I'll say here, and what I said to Tara and what our team feels really strongly about is we always want our small businesses to succeed. We never want to see a small business not succeed. It is always our goal to help keep them informed, help develop payment plans for them, help them as best we can. But this has been a pattern of inconsistency. And so we are at a point where I would say that we're working with them, they are actively working with us. I want to be very clear that they're actively working with us to make those payments and make whole on those payments. But something that I want us to be aware of is that I would recommend and recommend for you to think about if it would be in our best interest to continue a lease without being made whole. And I say that because there was a lease prior made without it being whole, and that was before me. So they were behind. There was a document to get them whole. It was not fulfilled. And that was. You may have questions. Well, if it wasn't fulfilled at that time, well, then why was something not done? I will tell you that was actually during the transition between myself and Steve. So I feel that that may have fallen through the cracks a bit there, but at the same time, we picked it back up. We've since looked at that. We've since reevaluated it. They're actively working with us, and we hope that they are made whole by the time it's time for them to get a new lease. In the meantime, I will be giving you monthly updates on where they stand so that we can talk through that a little bit further as we near the end of their lease. Their lease goes to October? I believe so. I think it's end of October. They have about five or six months to pay everything back and play current rent. Correct. And when's their first payment due? The first payment is due at the end of this month. Well, no sooner. That also gives them the summer, which I would assume is their peak time, because the weather should be better. So if they can't make it, then they're not going to make it. Probably. They've implemented some new hours and we're very hopeful that they will succeed. And again, we want them to succeed, but we also wanted you all to be aware of where they stand currently. Does that bring into question whether the 5% increase on a new lease is negotiable too, for them? Yeah, I think we would need to look at our, we did a market analysis, a benchmark analysis on all of the leases. And so without looking at that, I'd want to, like, reevaluate that. It's hard. It's really hard. Right. Because you gotta be consistent. Right. You've got to be consistent. We want our small business to be there, but we've also, I think as a commissioner at least, you know, we have, we've learned pretty, pretty much the hard way that there's just so many facility maintenance improvements that need to be done on that building. And in order to continue to do those, we need to generate funding to be able to do those.

So part of what they pay for helps to generate funding to be able to provide them with a quality, quality buildings. The window replacement's got to be a huge impact on them, though. Yes. As you replace those big windows. Just out of curiosity, do you have people asking about what space the city might have to lease on a regular basis or at all? Or is it not until building is vacant and advertised? Do people reach out to you? No people, I would say in the summer months I get many more calls, but in the winter months, I get a call at least once a month, if not more. But in the summer months we do, I think last summer, and this kind of goes back to what Dee said, let's get Missy's submission because we have, we have asked her for that and are waiting on that. And so I think we need to just give her a deadline. We need your submission by the end of next month. Yeah, I think Bill fries the commission. We need maybe your judgment on how, what kinds of people have approached you and how easily you think we would run it and would we actually have somewhat of a competition to pick from? I mean, that would be nice to know as we look at that proposal. You don't have to answer that tonight. I mean, I think you guys should really think about it and look who's called and kind of give us from a staff perspective what would make a final decision on whether we don't want to give it to the farmers market or some other entity. It'd be nice if we had some idea. Yeah, yeah. I think too. Something else to consider is if you part of that too, though, is I would recommend getting a realtor in that area and bringing in a professional. Honestly, that's not what I do. Sure. And so I don't, I don't. I can certainly, I can give you a spreadsheet of everyone who's contacted knocking your door down to try to get in there, though. I can give you a spreadsheet, everyone who's contacted me, but I think part of it too is I really believe that if that space was actually marketed for rent, I think you could. Right. If you're getting that much interest not being marketed, what's the interest? If it's marketed? Absolutely. So that's all I would say tonight, is that I really do think that if you marketed that space, you could potentially get some. That's good to know. I mean, that's obviously part of the equation. Has the city not found a property marketing specialist or whatever that they were exploring for the various. I know that was talked about early on to bring in some sort of. Or contract with or something. A real estate person, not just for the roof and improvement properties, but for various things the city owns all over the place. Yeah, I would say at that time. At this time it's been closed. Okay. Because like, even the skatepark concessions. And this may be a question for Chad, but it's like, is that available if a new operator wanted to give it a go? I know they haven't had luck in the past, but I'm curious about stuff like that. Whether if they had somebody come out and say, hey, you know, there's more going on down here. They're redoing the skate park soon. I'd like to try operating a snack bar in the quarter million dollar snack bar building. Yeah. That we all love. I do love it, though, actually. I wish it was a snack bar. I know it's a waste. I mean, they don't even put a grown up there. They don't even have the bathrooms open there, do they? I don't know. There's a lot of bathrooms on the riverfront that are not open. But that's why. That's why the free house is so well used. Yeah. I have two really quick things. The marquette dock repairs have been completed. They, unfortunately, while they were in there, found a couple other things that were immediate that needed to be repaired. So they took care of those as well. So to my knowledge, I haven't been down there yet. But in talking to Reese, he had said that they repaired everything that they said they were going to made those additional repairs. So those docs are fully functional. In talking with Reed about the credit island docs, he brought to me a number of concerns which I detailed in my last email. They were potentially at some point hit by a truck and so are very mangled. The railing is very mangled. I met with our risk department just to see if a claim was ever submitted or anything, and it appears not. So with that being said, that will make things a little bit more expensive at this point. Reid had said he thinks it would well exceed $3,000 to make those repairs. And so in talking with Courtney, we think this would probably something that needs to be tabled, at least for a little bit. And I would say that purely from a budget standpoint. So we're at. We're nearing the end of our fiscal year. We've had some significant and substantial costs come in this year. Everything from between the parapet wall to having to repair flooring that was rotting to up dating all of the steps at the diner. So there have definitely all the concrete steps here. So there have been quite a few unexpected expenses.

So there have been quite a few unexpected expenses. And so given where we're at at this point in time, I would tell you that we do not have the funds to support this right now. Something I want to. I'm just going to throw it out there, but something to discuss later is developing more on that. I mean, to have docks at Credit island, to have docks is one thing, to have docks at Credit island to attract boats, because you've got food trucks and whatever in that area for them to come and get lunch or dinner or whatever when they're out in the river, you know, which then we can, you know, charge the food trucks and whatever, you know, portable shops. I wouldn't want anyone to build there. But, you know, then that $3,000 might be worth it. Right. So it's, it's not just fixing the docks, but it's fixing the docks for, for what purpose? And again, not just to make things, but from the revenue side so that those docs can support themselves, you know, for the out years and build new docs. You know, we had to have new docks ten years from now. Completely new docs. Right. But the money's there because we've been leasing this land for food vendors and whatever shop vendors that come and sit there that the boats want to come to. So just really quickly, Riverfront cleanup is this Saturday. A big thank you to Bill for volunteering to help. We actually had a staff member step up, so she'll be kind of running the show on Saturday in my place so that Bill can clean to his heart's content. Thank you, Bill. Weather backup date. So as of now, typically, and this was kind of in the text of what is on the page is if it's slightly raining, it goes on. If it is severe enough, the event will be canceled. So. And that will be relayed. I'll be sending out an email before I leave to everybody so that they're aware that if there is indeed severe weather on Saturday morning, that, like I told you, this is a Boy Scout camping weekend. Hiking's involved. And of course, it's not just rain. They're calling for like thunderstorms. I'm like yay. Yeah. So yeah, I'll be keeping an eye on things too, from Wisconsin, the funerals Friday night. So Saturday morning I'll be able to, you know, check the radar and all that. So. And then hopefully we will be launching the big nine to the press on Thursday. Watching the the big nine, the summer concert series that we've been working on. We have the full lineup done, have secured our three acts for the credit island concert. We have some really amazing graphics courtesy of I need to give a shout out to Gio on our comms team. He has just put together some beautiful, beautiful things. So I am currently in the works of trying to figure out how we can really market this in a way that's different than what we've done before. He sent me a concert poster mock up today, which was lovely. And we're looking into some other publicity options as well. But that should go live on Thursday. And then I am also I met with DDP on Monday about doing a little event over at Bechdel park, which is the little park over by last picture House and Dam View Inn. Originally that was a location that we wanted to have a big nine concert. Unfortunately, we're not able to get the show mobile into that space. And so we are talking about this is our working title, but doing toast and jam, it will be a brunch themed acoustic session that will also be in conjunction with the one day that we have both riverboat cruises arriving on the same day, which is in August. So as we get more details on that, I will certainly share those. But DDP was very excited and willing to help in many ways. So I'm really excited to kind of explore that and then also give our riverboat cruises another option of something to do when they land. So that's something that we've all kind of been working on, is trying to get them to come to the downtown space, especially the motor row area, and utilize a lot of those small businesses over in that area. So I will be working with them on that. We had kind of a big meeting. There was a lot of updates. We actually had a public with comment again, which was one of the representatives from the dog park. They've been pretty vocal lately, but it's good because they're coming with really specific concerns, some of which can be, I think, fairly easily dealt with and others are longer term stuff like traffic calming on South Marquette because I guess somebody went off the road and possibly crashed into the dog park at one point. There's some south market. I didn't. I don't know. This is just coming from the public comments and it wasn't exactly clear, but they were dreaming of some sort of traffic calming down there because I guess there's some drag racing in that area that negatively impacts the whole area. But there is some equipment coming from the city. I think it sounds like there's a really passionate group of dog off leash area users down there that. That want more involvement from the city and maybe should get more involvement, but they're willing to do stuff like volunteer, like they had a shed for tools and stuff so they coul", "answer_v2":

representatives from the dog park. They've been pretty vocal lately, but it's good because they're coming with really specific concerns, some of which can be, I think, fairly easily dealt with and others are longer term stuff like traffic calming on South Marquette because I guess somebody went off the road and possibly crashed into the dog park at one point. There's some south market. I didn't. I don't know. This is just coming from the public comments and it wasn't exactly clear, but they were dreaming of some sort of traffic calming down there because I guess there's some drag racing in that area that negatively impacts the whole area. But there is some equipment coming from the city. I think it sounds like there's a really passionate group of dog off leash area users down there that. That want more involvement from the city and maybe should get more involvement, but they're willing to do stuff like volunteer, like they had a shed for tools and stuff so they could clean up the place themselves. And then that was damaged in some way and it hadn't been replaced. So hopefully Chad and his staff are working with them because it seems like a potential really win to get these people to take care of the park themselves and not have to have a ton of staff time. And they seem very willing to do it. And then we had a big presentation of just all the projects that are going on, which there's a ton of ARPA projects still. There's four playgrounds that are finishing up. The Fairmont Community center building is finishing up. The dose spray ground next to Hays School is starting construction. There's three multi sport courts starting construction. The credit island playground is, I think, starting construction soon. We had a small update on Main street landing that I suggested Chad be given to this group at some point. The emice clubhouse, they're going to start fundraising for that, which is a big project for them. The skate park is clubhouse at the golf course. Yeah. Replacing that Emeis. Yeah. With a couple million dollar new one probably. And then the skate park is getting an upgrade. They're going to be adding like a beginner kids, just a beginner area, basically. I guess the main skatepark is a little intimidating and there's some hope, I think, that bringing the littler kids and families down there will, I think, mitigate any issues if there's all age groups down there. So they want to add another area. Yeah. And that's, I think, funded in the CIP already. Oh, it is. And. Yeah. So that's happening. I think as soon as the season starts winding down this year, they're going to start construction and they're also fixing and updating some things in the main skate park. And they've been working with a national skate park consulting group and a lot of skaters. They've had a lot of public input, and people are passionate about that as well. And then they are, they've gotten some funding for some security cameras for various parks that they're going to be over the next three years, adding slowly and kind of evaluating, because there's been such a lot of vandalism at a lot of different parks. So hopefully that can deal with some of that. And then we got a report from Dan Sheridan from junior achievement, which that's all in the news, but I will say, rather than me going to any of it, junior theater. Junior. Sorry, junior theater misspoke. They have put together a really good website, which has been in the media lately, too, that's got kind of a day to day kind of what's happening, because it's moving so fast and there's so many stakeholders involved. They want to really be transparent and tell the public what's happening, which currently what's happening is probably them moving to North park for three ish years while they hopefully develop plans for a permanent new construction junior theater. And one of the things that was said that I found interesting is that there was no, because there's a nonprofit that's a part of junior theater, and there's no expectation from the city that the nonprofit should have to fund relocation. That's the city's choice and fault, or whatever you want to say. So they're not looking to this nonprofit to deal with the city's choice to move out of Annie Whitmire. Why do they have to move out of Annie Whitmire? Well, they're giving it to a developer to turn into housing. The city didn't want to pay for all the upkeep of 1800 cottages, so they're evicting them and they're paying for the eviction, so to speak, the cities. No, I think that's all good. Yeah. Yeah. They're not expecting them to pay for their own eviction, essentially, which, which is, I was impressed by that statement. That's not their problem. The nonprofit arm, they can still start fundraising for future things. And there was even stuff like the updates that were done to nice wander theater fairly recently. Some of them are removable. Some of the seating and some of the lighting stuff can be moved, certainly to the old Yonkers site in the short term and maybe even to a new construction site in the longer term. So that it doesn't feel like they wasted money three years ago on new equipment. So. Yeah, and like I said, there's a website that has a lot of stuff on that, and I've known Dan Sheridan a long time, and he's all over this stuff, so. And then we got a little update again on the trails committee. They really need committee members and they really need Walker and runner members. They have a pretty well represented group of bicyclists, but they don't have a lot of. They want the full spectrum of users of trails. And it's right now pretty cycling heavy. So they're trying to find somebody from each ward, just like a regular board or commission. So there's a website on the Parks website that you can find information about that, too. Oh, and then our next meeting is our spring bus tour of all these different projects, because we're going to.

The first one is autism awareness month, and that will be read by Alderwoman Berkholder. Alderwoman Berkholder, please. Thank you. City of Davenport, Iowa. Proclamation. Whereas autism spectrum disorder, ASD is a developmental disability that can significantly impact one's social, communication, and behavioral abilities, and whereas, individuals with ASD may communicate, interact, behave, and learn differently from neurotypical people, the intelligence level of ASD people can range from extremely gifted to severely challenged. And some with ASD need more help than others. And whereas, in the US, approximately one in 36 children have been diagnosed with ASD, and roughly 5.5 million Americans live with some form of ASD, and whereas people with ASD can struggle socially, emotionally, and communication wise, some show repetition in certain behaviors and daily activities. And many people with ASD learn, play, pay attention, and react to different things differently. And whereas ASD can sometimes be detected at 18 months or younger, by age two, a professional ASD diagnosis is considered reliable. And through therapy at an early age, children can learn various physical, social, and control skills. And whereas, 74% of ASD students graduate high school, and 70% of ASD people who receive vocational rehabilitation training can find a career path and develop their skills in their field. And now, therefore, we, Mayor Mike Matson and the City Council of Davenport, Iowa, do hereby proclaim April 2024 as Autism Awareness Month in Davenport and urge our community to promote autism awareness, inclusion, and self determination for all and assure that each person with ASD is provided an opportunity to achieve the highest possible quality of life.

Dated this 10th day of April, 2024, I moved the proclamation second. All in favor? All opposed? And I have Jason Halquias accepting the proclamation if you want to meet me at the podium. Well, I would like to say a few words, council. I duly appreciate you're willing to appreciate. You know, sometimes words cannot explain how much I appreciate that. It is important that we, you know, bring full awareness to one of the fastest growing demographics of people, not just here, but anywhere. And it's nice to know that there is a lot of help out there for others who sometimes have it harder than others. And as someone with autism myself, and I've gone through a lot, gone through a lot of challenges, and it's important to bring awareness because ultimately the goal is full acceptance. And unfortunately, a lot of people out there just don't understand how to appreciate people like me and anyone out there who might be affected with this condition. So for all that, I express full appreciation and. Thank you. Thank you. Next one is National Public Safety Telecommunications Week. It will be read by Alderman Jobshin. Alderman Jobshin, please. Thank you, mister mayor. Whereas, emergencies occur around the clock every day that require response from public safety resources, and whereas, the prompt processing of emergency calls and determining the correct response resources is critical to the protection of life and preservation of property, and whereas, the safety of all public safety personnel depends upon information obtained from those who dial 911 and reach the Scottish Emergency Communication center, and wHereas, public safety dispatchers are the first and most critical contact our citizens have with emergency services, and whereas, public safety dispatchers are an essential safety line for our responders by monitoring their activities by radio, providing them information, and ensuring their safety, and whereas, public safety dispatchers of the Scott Emergency Communications center contribute substantially to the successful outcomes for law enforcement and medical responses. And now, therefore, we, Mayor Mike Matson and the City Council of Davenport, Iowa, do hereby proclaim April 14 through the 20th, 2024, as national public safety to mount Telecommunicators Week in Davenport, and recognize those whose diligence and professionalism keep our city and citizens safe. Dated this 10th day of April, 2024, I move the proclamation. All in favor? Aye. All opposed? Same sign. This proclamation accepted. And we have Tracy Screechfield, deputy director, Scott Emergency Communications center, here to receive this proclamation, whom I'll meet at the podium. Thank you. I just want to say thank you for the acknowledgement and recognizing what we do day in and day out. As a dispatcher for 16 years here in the city of Davenport and all of Scott county, now, it means a lot when people recognize us and what we do. Over the past year, I've been getting a lot of thank yous from callers, and, you know, our officers are always very appreciative, so it's nice when the council can recognize us as well. So thank you. That was Chantelle Maury. So one of our night shift dispatchers, she didn't introduce herself. I also want to say thank you to the council for recognizing our staff for doing this. They are truly the heroes behind the headset. So I love to brag about our staff, and unfortunately, they don't get the calls every day of anybody saying thank you for what they do. They are taking calls every single day of getting. Unfortunately, everybody is worse, but they are at their best every day to take these calls. So thank you for recognizing them for what they do every day. I wouldn't have my career if it weren't for them. I'd do my job for them. And they are a magnificent group. We wish we could give them more than one week, and we appreciate everything they do and you guys for recognizing them. So thank you. Thank you. Next is National Work zone awareness week, read by Alderwoman Newton. Alderwoman Newton, please. Thank you, mayor. So whereas highway and street construction work, as well as repairs to roadways are often completed while the roadway is open to traffic, putting both motorists and workers at risk every day. And whereas, public works, law enforcement, firefighters, EMTs and other emergency personnel put themselves in harm's way on the roads each day during performance of their duties, and whereas, workers diligently continue to improve, rebuild, and maintain roadways so that motorists can safely and effectively travel and whereas, accidents can be prevented by setting aside distractions, using extra caution, reducing speeds, and giving work zones your undivided attention while motoring and wHEreAs, the city of Davenport is dedicated to ensuring the safety of workers, motorists, passengers, bicyclists, pedestrians while in work zones and wHEReAs, the city of Davenport reminds motorists of the importance of obeying work zone signage and barricades and maintaining safe and smart driving habits during the construction season ", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Scott Emergency Communications Center\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Critical in processing emergency calls and determining correct response resources\",\n            \"Essential safety line for responders by monitoring their activities by radio, providing information, and ensuring their safety\",\n            \"Substantial contribution to successful outcomes for law enforcement and medical responses\",\n            \"Recognized for diligence and professionalism in keeping the city and citizens safe\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"buy\",\n        \"comment\": \"The Scott Emergency Communications Center is positively recognized for its critical role in emergency response and public safety.

And whereas, the city of Davenport also reminds motorists that hands on use of cell phones, as well as sending reading, composing electronic messages while driving, is unsafe for everyone, and that motorists should slow down and change lanes if possible when approaching an emergency construction or maintenance vehicle that is stationary and or displaying flashing lights. And now, therefore, we, Mayor Mike Matson and the City Council of Davenport, Iowa, do hereby proclaim April 15 of 2024 through April 19 of 2024 as National Work Zone Awareness Week in Davenport and urge all citizens to practice safe, responsible driving while traveling on roadways year round, especially during construction season. Dated this 10th day of April, 2024, I move this proclamation. I hear a second. All those in favors, please say aye. Anyone opposed this proclamation moves. Here to accept this proclamation is Jeff Deppy with laborers 309 and the Quad City Federation of Labor Muscatine in Scott county next week kicks off National Highway Safety Week. But we also consider that our city workers, our county workers and our state workers, our police, firefighters and emts counting this, too, because they're out there on the roadways, keeping us safe, too. Our biggest message is, next Wednesday, wear orange, because that's when we remember the fallen. It was just 2020 when we lost our member Willie Hollywood. In between Westlake and bluegrass. He was ran over as a flagger at 80 miles an hour. Gets me emotionally, is one month from retirement. You think you can train, you think you can outrun a vehicle coming at you. But all he had was a hard hat and a vest when a two ton missile was coming at him. It was two weeks ago. A sheriff's deputy in DeKalb county was killed while she was doing her duties on the side of the road. She's not going home to her family. So we want to remind you, when you get into a construction zone, slow down, take an extra minute or two, and leave earlier. Don't use your phones. And if you see emergency personnel, give them a link, because they're probably saving somebody's life. And then next Friday, we'll be at the rest stops, and we'll be with some county police and some county public works members. And we're going to be handing out pamphlets in Illinois. Scott's law. I know there's a law over here. I talked to Mayor Gallagher. They finally got that over here about moving over for emergency personnel. It's very important. And we're going to hand out Keller books and just remind people that you're really going to see nationwide, the cones and the barricades are going to really start coming out next week. Even though the weather's been so good, technically, the construction starts next week. That's when you're going to start seeing your asphalt crews, your concrete crews, and everybody come out. So again, I want to thank you. This is not just a Davenport thing. Bettendorf, Davenport, Scott County, Rock Island County, Rock Island City, east, bullying, mullein, syllabus, all partake in this. Every year I try to come get the proclamations, but sometimes there's two governments going at once. But I want to thank you again for recognizing your workers and the safety in their lives. Thank you. Thank you. And the next one and last is Earth week will be read by Alderwoman McGuinness. Alderwoman McGuinness, please. Thank you, your honor.

County, Extreme Extreme Cleanup, and other community members and agencies whose efforts further promote stewardship and conservation of our natural resources. And wheReas, the environmental realities of our time require humans to make a dramatic shift in our relationship to the earth, now, therefore, we, Mike Matson, Mayor, and the City Council of Davenport, Iowa, do hereby proclaim April 22 through April 26, 2024, as Earth Week in Davenport and recognize the contributions the city and the community make daily to support and sustain the commune, the community. I would ask to move this proclamation second. All in favor? Okay, thank you. So any opposed? So we will be. Nicole Gleason, public works director, will be accepting the proclamation tonight. Thank you. One, two, three. Thank you. So, Nicole Gleason, public works just thank you for this. And one of our partners who helps with internship around the city is here as well. We do have a tree planting event coming up. It's advertised online for sign up, so encourage everyone to participate, participate in those events. And on behalf of progressive action for the common good, we would like to thank the city of Davenport and our mayor for this proclamation. Progressive action does a lot in the environment issues and anything that come up, we're always there. So I just want to thank you all. And just remember, every day is Earth Day. Thank you. Thank you. All right, next is petitions and communications. I have one, and then I see a couple other folks have some. So the city of Davenport was honored to receive a big deal, a big grant recently, last week. So I want to read and just tell you about it from the Federal Highway Administration. That organization awarded the city $13.1 million for flood mitigation and infrastructure improvements. This is through a grant program that looks to ensure transportation system resiliency to natural hazards, which includes flooding. The projects that will be funded through this grant are derived from the 2021 Mississippi River Flood Resiliency Plan and will build off of current projects that are under construction. The projects aim to establish a permanent flood detour during major floods, ensure interstate travel, access to the city of Rock island and the Rock Island Arsenal from Davenport, improved transportation safety within the project corridor. I'd like to specifically thank our federal partners and other state and local partners, especially the Federal Highway Administration, the Department of Transportation, who supported this application, and thank the staff especially for their work. This grant is hard to get. This project protect grant and their work to continue to pursue and write these grants on behalf of the city. The community identified better flood mitigation efforts as a key goal which resulted in a flood resiliency plan. And this is another $13.1 million investment to make that plan come to action. Partnerships matter. Some of the projects specifically, there'll be some road raises at Gaines street and Second street to maintain access to Centennial Bridge, Leclair street and Third street to maintain access to Arsenal Bridge, Rockingham Road between Washington, Sturtevant and Marquette and Fillmore, River Drive and Mound street traffic safety improvements and street repairs. Reconfiguration of the intersections of third and river and fourth and river street repairs along Rockingham and Marquette to accommodate heavy, heavier traffic volumes along the detour route. So a big deal for us. Thank you staff, for working so hard. Thank you everybody that talked to our respective federal partners, our senators, our legislators and the Department of Transportation. Again, hard to get. And we, and we are honored to receive over $13 million. Thank you very much. And I see Alderman grip. Thank you, your honor. I don't have any new news from the city administrator search special committee, but I did want to reiterate to the public and to the council that the search. The special committee did interviews on executive search firms last week. We have a recommendation that we're going to be making to the council. You'll see that in your packet for next week on Friday. And so you will see the recommendation coming to you at the committee of the whole on April 17. And at that meeting I will not be doing the update. Our chair, Mister Mulhart Heider from Rhythm City casino will be here to speak to that recommendation. Thank you, your honor. Thank you, Alderman grip. Alderman Reinertz, just to notice that we'll be holding 8th ward ward meeting tomorrow night, six to 730 at Red Hawk golf course. Looking forward to seeing you. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Reinerts. Alderman Kelly. Thank you. I never have anything written down or anything to be positive. So tonight, my thing is for my gen exeters that remember this group named Houdini. Friends, how many of us have won? We all took this position to do the right thing in our communities and do the right thing in the city of Davenport. So I always have to end it with, when you know better, you do better.

We all took this position to do the right thing in our communities and do the right thing in the city of Davenport. So I always have to end it with, when you know better, you do better. But I just want to tell you about some events going on in my neck of the woods. So if you guys aren't familiar with the east Village, because we don't get that much shine, but it's a small place a little east of downtown, still along the river. There's going to be a couple events going on this summer that they have all the time, but I wanted to bring a spotlight to the things that are going on in the east village. The criterium is in May. June is the village hops, which is a brew thing. So if you're a beer drinker, come down and taste some of the suds. And, you know, I'll keep talking about things that are going to be going on and on because their summers are popping in the east village. I'm going to try to make sure to bring light to what's going on in the fifth ward. And I have a meeting every end of the month on Thursdays. This month, it will be at the church on the corner of grand and Kirkwood. I believe that's harvest time, family time. I just know the pastor. I grew up underneath him. So. Mom, what's the name of the church? Harvest time on the corner of Kirkwood and Grand. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Kelly. Alderwoman McGinnis. Thank you, your honor. Just wanted to let everyone know by following up on the announcement of the grant, which we all saw at the end of the week last week. It's very exciting. The third ward meeting will be Monday, April 15, and our topic will be the flood plan. An update on what's happening with silent crossings and also what's happening with the flood plan. There is work going on, of course, right now. This is a wonderful addition, much needed. And there's other dollars that are going on right now. Work that's happening. So Clay Merritt will be our guest to talk about all of this. There is a lot of interest in the silent crossings, and that will be part of what we're talking about as well. Well, where that is. So an update on all things along the river. And that will be on. That will be Monday, April 15, 630, right here in council chambers. Thank you, your honor. Thank you, alderman mcGinnis. Alderman rick duncan. Thank you, your honor. It's just nice to see the ARpa projects are moving along, I see. They started on the sewer. They're working pretty good on the splash pad at Hays pool. They started work on the multi sports court at Van buren. But I guess my biggest concern is where are we at with the community center? I don't need that answer tonight, but it just looks like that project's taken quite a while. We can get you an update this week. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Dunn. Anyone else? Very good. We'll move to our individual approval of items on the discussion agenda. The first item is a first consideration of an owner's providing for the sale an issuance of 27,715,000 general obligation corporate bonds, csrs 2024, and for the levy of taxes to pay the same. And before I go to the public, I'm going to go to Miss Merritt, who's going to go to Mister Burmeister, who's with PFM, to give us an update. Ma'am. Thank you, mayor. As you know, our FY 24 bond sale was held today. One of the most important pieces of this entire process is receiving our annual bond rating as part of the overall process, which essentially serves as our municipal credit score. And that's directly linked to what interest rate we will receive when we go to the market to actually sell the bonds. So during that process, both Moody's and S and P reaffirmed the city's rating, which positioned us very well as we headed into today's sale. And with that, the city's financial advisor, John Burmeister, with PFM, is here today to present the results of our sale. Thank you. John Burmeister with PFM. Pleasure to be here. Somewhere along the side of your packet, you should see a results of sale. I'm pleased to tell you we received 14 different bids. We had about five or six signed up. When I checked out last night and I woke up or came in the office this morning, we had actually 14 different underwriting firms that were signed up. If you look through these pages, this is actually six pages, pages deep. There's about 60 different underwriters located all over the United States. And if you look at page, the bottom of page five, you can see there's like 35 different underwriters in one bid alone. They're coming from all over the United States. New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, California, Ohio, North Carolina. That tells us that the market is looking at the city as a very strong credit. As Mallory indicated, your ratings were confirmed at a aa two. Keep up the good work. I think the strength of the city is the financial performance.

There's about 60 different underwriters located all over the United States. And if you look at page, the bottom of page five, you can see there's like 35 different underwriters in one bid alone. They're coming from all over the United States. New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, California, Ohio, North Carolina. That tells us that the market is looking at the city as a very strong credit. As Mallory indicated, your ratings were confirmed at a aa two. Keep up the good work. I think the strength of the city is the financial performance. They state here in their report card for you that you have very conservative budgeting practices. You've developed surpluses each year. And so they see that, they look at your audit, they confirm that every year. And then they also. They're looking at your 24 budget year, 25 budget. So keep up the good work on that front. So all of that is really kind of indicative, then, of the bids we went out this morning. We sent out the official statement, the rating reports, and we got Sig 14 different bids. If you look at the bids here, you can see Morgan Stanley had a consortium of bidders. And then there's a little number off, kind of off to the right side. It's called tic. That's true interest costs. It's similar to the APR and a car loan, we'd call it, in our industry, true interest costs. So you can see Morgan Stanley had a 3.4524%. And if you kind of look at the COVID which was JPMorgan, they came in at 346. And if you flip all the way to the back, you can see 3.57%. And then even a 3.59%, everybody's got a different opinion where that market is. They all have different investors. And so they try to figure out where that market is, what their investors want, and they lock in that rate for the. So this rate here, they've, you know, it's changing every second of the day. So they lock this rate in to give you the council, the time to approve that this evening, and then they can go ahead and ticket it to the investors tomorrow. So it's not. Cause, in fact, the interest rates went up a little bit after your bids this morning at 10:00 a.m. so they are headed up a little bit higher. You can see then that with the bids, we were able to drop the paramount down to 24,000,805 from the 27,000,715. And then that resulted in a final true interest cost of 3.4499%. And so with that, I'll turn it over to any questions you may have. And if there aren't any, I would recommend that you award this to Morgan Stanley and company at a 3.4499% true interest cost. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Very good. Thank you for your work and support, Miss Merritt. Anything else? Not right now, mayor. Very good. Okay. Is there any public with comment? Seeing none.

I think it's so much inappropriateness in the last since at least 2021. And you guys got mad at me for mentioning that this woman was the personnel director.

I'm not supposed to mention names, but there are people among us who spent years working at Central High School. They know when they come down here that the diversity of the city does not look like the top of the city employment ladder. If the city had a fair hiring practices. Approximately 50% of the wages and the benefits, the retirement benefits and the healthcare and the money to buy houses and the money to buy cars.

Directly, the personnel history. But more than that, everyone who was involved in the expulsion of alderman Cornett should not be rewarded for that. The city is spending millions of dollars and the election was, what, four weeks away? We were spending millions of dollars on lawsuits and court cases because there was some emergency that I believe had to do with creating an atmosphere in order to give $2 million to someone. And it's all related. And I personally believe that the decision to vote to give $2 million almost to someone and to hide that fact. Mister, was stay on. Should. Miss Merritt can be the interim city. Right? And my argument is she was a participant in the deliberations that led to hiding the fact of the money until after the election, which to me represents a form of election fraud. And I'll sit down. But I believe it should be investigated as a criminal election fraud. Thank you. Next please. My name is David Ezra Sidron. I live in the third ward. This is now the third time I have stood before you and asked the council not to legitimize a payoff for Misses Merritt. Since I last spoke before you, I spoke before the Iowa House Oversight committee in Des Moines. The Iowa House Oversight Committee is extremely concerned, as is the Iowa State Auditorium, about these extraordinary payoffs in Davenport. These payoffs are the causes of numerous investigations and lawsuits. The Iowa Capital Dispatch reported. Secrecy over lucrative payout creates a stench at Davenport City hall. The Quad City Times reported. It looks like the mayor and maybe others purposely withheld the information because it might hurt the reelection bids. The perception of Davenport as a dysfunctional and perhaps unethical city government is now statewide. Mister Sedren, please stay on. Should Miss Merritt continue as the interim city administrator? Mister mayor, with all due respect, I am on topic. Noted local political reporter Ed Tibbets wrote a scathing article entitled the smell that lingers at Davenport City hall about this sordid affair. On September 1, 2023, at 08:04 a.m. then city administrator Corey Spiegel sent an email to misses Merritt captioned re our 830 meeting and attached to it were the Torres and Thorndike separation agreement payoffs. This is proof that Misses Merritt was intimately involved with the payoffs for Spiegel, Thorndike and Torres. Misses Merritt knew all about the payoffs. Misses Merritt knew all the dirty details. And she helped keep the information about the payoffs secret until after last year's election. And now she's asking for a $50,000 payoff. To quote our local media, this stinks and we all know it. There is no legitimate reason to give misses Merritt a $50,000 payoff. Rather, Misses Merritt should be fired immediately for assisting in a coverup that has brought lawsuits, investigations and shame. Shame to the city of Davenport. I ask the city council to once again deny this absurd payoff to misses Merritt. Thank you Mister mayor. Thank you. And I'll ask the audience, audience, audience. If you keep disturbing this meeting by clapping or yelling out, I will ask you to leave. Okay. I warned you at the beginning. I will do that. So last time. Next please. My name is Kelly Sidron. I'm with him. Please take the lady that keeps disturbing the meeting and ask her to leave. She is fine. She's fine. No, ma'am, that is not up to you. Sir. Please, ma'am, you'll get your time. Absolutely. You'll get your time. Carrie on, you can't do this. There is civil litigation at Scott county right now for the deeds that were done just like this. Different names, different dates, different amounts. You can't do this. You've got to stop. You were hired to stop this. Now stop it. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again expecting a different result. This, ladies and gentlemen, is insane. You can't do this. This is our money. Do it the right way. Redo it and do it right. And do it by the law this time. And stop committing crimes. Thank you. Thank you. Next please. Judith Lee, second ward. I'd like to tell you a little allegory. You want to go on vacation and you don't have the money your uncle offers to pay for your vacation.

Different names, different dates, different amounts. You can't do this. You've got to stop. You were hired to stop this. Now stop it. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again expecting a different result. This, ladies and gentlemen, is insane. You can't do this. This is our money. Do it the right way. Redo it and do it right. And do it by the law this time. And stop committing crimes. Thank you. Thank you. Next please. Judith Lee, second ward. I'd like to tell you a little allegory. You want to go on vacation and you don't have the money your uncle offers to pay for your vacation. And four months later you find out that your uncle got the money by embezzling at his work. But no one but you knows. At the same time, you also find out that you have a cd that matures with enough money to pay for your vacation. If you use your uncle's money, you'll be supporting him in breaking the law. If you use your own money or being honest and doing what you know is the right thing, using your own money would also provide you the opportunity to report your uncle's embezzlement, even though that would be extremely uncomfortable and difficult for you and your family. What will you do? What I heard from some of you last week is that you will rationalize your uncle's illegal money. Because either way, the outcome is the same. So it doesn't matter. You go on your vacation to Mexico. Tonight you are considering how do you choose to select the interim city administrator and what their responsibilities will be? There are so many aspects of the decision each of you will make tonight that are based on violations of authority and state code, your integrity and public trust. There are many people watching what happens tonight. I understand that the House Oversight committee already has the documents relevant to the decisions you will make tonight. The executive orders, the Mous higher separation agreement, the resolutions and other supporting documents. And I assume they will also receive the vote outcome and how each of you vote. Does each of you on the council believe in the rule of law, believe in honesty, have integrity, and believe in doing the right thing for the right reasons? Or do you want to cover for others, including some of you who chose to work in the dark, out of the public and even some alderman's views, to get what they and some of you wanted to stay in power and to pay people a big something extra to ensure that everyone stays in line. Shall we remember who signed the memorandum of understanding from his merit Jobgen grip? McGinnis, Condon and Dunn, along with Matson. That isn't even a quorum yet you all thought yourselves about the law because you were chairs in pro tem. Or did you not understand how you were being manipulated? Either way, you have the opportunity to do the right thing tonight regarding the votes on both merit and hire. And having done the right thing tonight, you will start to turn all the awfulness that has been Davenport for too long into a more positive government. Choose not to continue the pattern of covering up and violating authorities and laws. The mayor, former corporation counsel, the interim corporation council, some of you outside counsel, former aldermen have created a very difficult situation for Davenport, and therefore for you in so many ways. And I am sorry for that. You've known since October that you were going to need a new city administrator. And suddenly we have a crisis. By making one positive vote tonight, you may find that it is possible that the answer is not the one you think. Maybe decide Mexico isn't where you want to be or how you should be spending your money. Maybe there is a positive outcome from making the hard decision that you haven't even thought of yet. The amendment allows for terminating the MoU and negotiating a new one moving forward instead of covering up a problem that many of you had nothing to do with. Just start over now, as the amendment suggests, and use legal, public and transparent processes and discussions that consider all the options and that would lead to an informed and supportable decision. This is not entirely about the money, although it is a lot of taxpayer money. It's about showing us your leadership, being unwilling to violate laws and your integrity, and taking back council authority and a strong council, weak mayor form of government. Here in Davenport. We look to you to turn the city around an immense job and I believe it starts tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Next please. Diane Salmon, 8th ward I'm so furious that I'm not even sure where to begin. I'm walking a fine line between being a good christ follower and trying not to let my emotions be in control and wanting to rip most of you a new one. This ridiculous spending needs to stop.

I'm so furious right now. You got it, girl. They're following the ones they vowed to stand against unquestionable and illegal things if they were elected. I have to wonder, for those who are business owners, are the people who utilize your business as just a dollar sign to you, or do you truly care about them? And if their needs are met. If it's the first one, it's not going to go well for you very long, because they will realize it and find someone who truly cares. And if it's the second one, maybe there's still hope for you to do the right thing. I have defended every single one of you new people time and time again, more times than I can count. And I keep asking people to give you a chance. But if you vote yes for this, that is done. Because you will have shown your constituents that you truly do not care what they think or how they feel about anything that is close to their hearts. You still have time to do the right thing, and I am asking you to do just that. I am, for all people being rewarded for hard work, but not when it comes at the cost of raising, hurting people's property taxes and taking out extra bonds to pay the rich so they get richer while the poor are struggling to live and becoming poor. We have clearly seen that those who are struggling are not a priority for very many of you, but they are for the residents of Davenport, and we will fight like hell for them. So I hope you keep that in mind when you vote. We have voices that are heard loud and clear outside of these walls. I'm so stinking, man. And those cannot be illegally silenced like you try to do to us. And hear Galatians six, seven. Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. We all have a judgment day coming up, and you might want to make sure you're right with the Lord before it happens, or it will not go well for you. I strongly urge you to say no until we get our city back together. This is ridiculous. Three men lost their lives. A woman lost her leg. People are homeless, and you want to give people who make more money than they ever need more money? What the hell? Thank you. Next, please. Sheryl Shagna. Third word. And I again want to strongly suggest that you vote no to ratify the the bonus tonight. And justification of bad behavior is almost as bad as bad behavior in itself. And the worst thing about dealing with narcissistic people is they are absolutely clueless that they are narcissistic. So on one hand, when you say if you go back and you do it the right way, you are automatically admitting that you are quite aware that you have done it the wrong way. But then when you want to use that, the n's justify the means. I get extremely angry because, no, the n does not justify the means. The process matters. Doing it the right way matters. You would not expect anything less from us. We do not expect anything less from you. It's what one chooses to focus on. One can focus on how much money one particular person is saving us, whereas everyone else is obviously seeing how much that one person is costing us. That conflict of interest. I've never seen a contract with so many clauses for conflict of interest. That alone should raise red flags. The agreement is a personnel agreement, is an executive order. It is not a contract. I absolutely do not believe there is any reason to continue to compound bad decisions made in 2023 and 2024. We had an eclipse this week. An opportunity to close the past, just completely move forward with a better future. You all could play shell games and think that we're blind. We're not. I've known enough magicians in my life to know to watch the left hand when the right hand is moving. You guys created a miracle this past week. I don't know if you realized it or not, but you got the Republicans and the Democrats into Des Moines to agree on something. I would like to say, great job, but I can't. I believe the words the man used was that in 50 years, he had not seen anything more egregious. And I know that the person we're looking at giving a bonus on took a part in that. I will set myself down. If you're going to point of order me, I'll get there before. Are you not going to point of order me? I saw your finger come out like it did last time.

It was not done properly because we, the citizens, weren't told what was happening at all. I have nothing to say about the qualifications of either person. It has nothing to do with that. I think that most of us in our workplace at one time or another have been asked to step up and fill in for somebody that's left. At least I know I have been. So I assume that other people have been also. I don't think it's unreasonable with the salaries that are paid to expect that next in command would be willing to step forward. And if they didn't, okay, then go to the next person. Frankly, I'm not even sure why we have a city attorney. Because it seems like we constantly, constantly you're hiring outside attorneys to do things. So what I'm asking you right now is please, please, please turn it around. Even if you were involved at the very beginning, this is the chance to turn it around and have the city quit looking at all of you the way they are. Because I promise you, it isn't just the people that are down here. I promise you. It's every place I go. I hear about some of you, and it's hurtful, even, because I've worked with a number of you.

Well, we hope we have our fingers and toes crossed that y'all guys would do the right thing. I don't know if we had to beg and plead and cry, but I hope we don't have to do that. So, I mean, just before y'all make this vote, dig really, really deep into yourself. No more back room deals, no more secret phone calls. You know, we want transparency. We've been asking for that. Some of us have been on this journey coming down here since May, June of last year, and we're tired of the back room conversations and deals. So this is the first chance. Well, y'all had chances before, but really, the new people, this is your first chance to go ahead and change that for us. We want it now. Thank you. Thank you. Next, please. Latrice Lacy, fifth ward. I'm asking that you vote no on this. We have seen a lack of ethics from this person, both in paying out almost $2 million without council approval, continuing to perpetuate a culture of racism, discrimination, retaliation, pettiness, cubescent behavior, unprofessionalism, stupidity. Why are we rewarding that? Why are we doing backroom deals and then digging our heels in? We can't get funding for anything. My staff, who got bonuses I paid out of my pocket, but people can get $50,000 bonuses with public funds. We can't even get $50,000 to fund a position. I make $20,000 less than the next lowest paid director, and you have a buffoon over here who's saying, oh, well, Miss Lacy, we're not going to take names. I'm not going to take the names. Please. That's not a name. Please. That's not a name. It's an accurate characterization. Please. Thank you. You're welcome. It's an accurate characterization. It is not. Yes, it is. Your ordinance very clearly says how our budget is decided. Who has authority over our budget. So either the person has not read the ordinance, even though that's their job, or they are a liar. So now I guess we can pick between the two. So it's either stupidity and incompetence, or it's unethicalness. One of the two. When is enough enough? Why are we saying, oh, well, this is the only way forward? It's not. Who's going to want to come in and clean up behind something like that? You're continuing to perpetuate the same kind of environment by keeping the same people in these positions. Why do you think the predecessor put them in the position? They didn't do it accidentally. Why do you think she approved something that you know full well counsel has not approved? Continuing this culture of secrecy. And we're gonna hide this and we're gonna cover this up.

Continuing this culture of secrecy. And we're gonna hide this and we're gonna cover this up. This is public funds. These are public decisions. You cannot hide and make public decisions. It's illegal and it's illegal for a reason. Because here we are tonight voting to approve bonds. We have how many millions of dollars in debt? Voting to increase our taxes to cover for payouts that were illegally given. Why, you could just correct the mismanagement and then you wouldn't need to take out all these bonds. You wouldn't need to be in so much debt. You wouldn't need to arbitrarily inflate our property values. None of that would be necessary because the city would be being run properly. The same people who've engaged in this behavior for years were saying, oh, why don't we give them an extra 50? Gave her husband a nice promotion. Who's her subordinate? Let's do something else. Let's give him some more money. Why? When are we going to see that there is some corruption going on and that it needs to stop? We can't just keep the corruption train going. At some point somebody has to say, this has to stop. We're gonna turn this around. We're gonna stop this. We're gonna stop the racisms. No one is saying it, though. We're saying, add it on the agenda. Let's give them another 50,000. Put some stank on it. Why? It's coming across as a bribe. That's a huge bonus to get as a public employee. Especially when we say we don't have funding for staff. We don't have funding for this, we don't have funding for that. We have to eliminate positions, but we can give out $50,000 bonuses. It's amazing how you have Harry Houdini at the head of your finance department who can pull flowers out of their hat and do a disappearing act. Thank you. Next, please. Katie from Davenport. Everything has been pretty much said, but two points I wanted to mention that was not. It was said a couple times now that other places have administrators and bonuses and all that. And I would like to know what these places that are being mentioned. Do they have buildings falling down and killing people? Do they have buildings that are almost going to fall down? Probably not. So they have the money to maybe do bonuses and all that. We don't. We are not like any other city. This is Davenport. We have buildings falling down. We have other buildings that are screaming that they're going to fall down with people that live in it. So how are we giving more money? Just a thought. Thank you. Next, please. I'm Mary Johansson. First word. I was here last month and I didn't understand who ran the city. I still don't. I still don't. And I'm sorry that I don't. $50,000 for someone that was part of a situation. And I agree with the other people that it looks like a payoff. It's a cover up. I'm sorry. The trust that you all have with the citizens of Devonport is really low. I don't know what else to say. It's disappointing. I think we have to do better just for representation. $50,000 maybe is not a lot to somebody, but it's too much to pay right now. If you can all do this in the proper way than it was done previously, then I suggest that you do it. If they still get the 50,000, well, then you've done it properly by the process that you should legally. If you don't, then you're just carrying on the previous process, which was not done legally. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next, please. Lacondix and 7th ward. I am up here to ask you to vote no to this item. I just want you guys to do better. I'm not gonna go in all like I usually do, but just do better. Your community deserves better. And you guys can go back and do this if you can. Another thing is, if you guys vote yes to this now, you think that we. Enough. Four years have been taken out. We really gonna be on your back. I mean, really gonna be on your back. Y'all think y'all had four years go out before. We gonna be checking every little receipt from now on. So this is your time to turn the ship around before you crash and burn it. Well, it's already crashed and burned, but y'all going for a second round. And I just wanna point this out as well. Last week, the court did not go into your favor. So I think y'all, like my sister said, y'all need to go into your ramen noodle budget. Because if you're giving somebody a $50,000 bonus, I hope that y'all think that you're gonna have to pay those victims more than $50,000 more and not shortchange people. So I just ask y'all to hold your pocketbooks a little closer, hold your wallets a little closer, and be a little tight with it, because I don't think this is good at all. And with all the investigations and everything that y'all guys have going on, I don't think that y'all have room to. To make any other decisions. Well, not all of you guys have lawsuits. Some of you. But y'all guys just need to tighten it up because y'all keep on doing this, y'all ain't gonna be here. I was at the nail slide, and I said, the lady was sitting next to me.

Thank you. Next, please. Adriana McBride, for. I just wanted to acknowledge the cute game played with the budget earlier. Pushing that sail a bond through really fast was really cool, too. Ma'am, we're talking about the inner city ministry. I'm very much aware. Finances, that's kind of like the job of this person to manage our finances. My question is, how can that person be trusted with much of what everyone else has said tonight, they knew. Pretty much what it seems like is that there's cronyism and dirty little secrets being kept, and perhaps is this a payout for that? I'm not really? Sure, it seems like it. And, yeah, the game of raising our property taxes and the value of properties to kind of play these little games with the bonds and money and stuff like that, and, like, denying public goods and services in exchange for these crazy payouts to different department heads, etcetera, it's just really not adding up. But ultimately, I would like for you guys to approve this so that when this does go to court, you'll all be held accountable, whoever's in collusion. Thank you. Thank you. Next, please. Oh, you guys updated the rules. Awesome. Just canoles, third ward. I just wanted to point out you've heard from several of us through the city, from different wards, not just one group of us from one ward, but all spread out. And I still have yet to find somebody that agrees with this payout. Like I said before, I've said it once, I've said it twice, and I'll say it again. Why are we even discussing a payout when we have all these lawsuits? Penny? Nobody deserves one. Thank you. Anyone else? Next, please. Derek Cornett, 7th ward. Looking at number two here. Item number two. It says, resolution ratifying executive order 2023 22. That executive order even legal? I think not. The mayor has overstepped his authority, and it's a moot point. He doesn't have that authority. Strong counsel, weak mayor. You guys hire and fire the city administrator. You guys hire and fire the corporate counselor. Okay? What is the problem with that? Don't you get it? I mean, you're just gonna let the mayor make these decisions? Who came up with $50,000? I mean, did the mayor and corporate councils get together and say, hey, you know, what do you think we can do for payouts today? You know, 50,000? Yeah, that sounds like a good deal. You know, yeah, let's put that in my executive order or my memorandum of understanding. You know what? You're here to represent the people. Do you think the people want that? I don't. I mean, you know, come on, guys. It doesn't smell right. Why did he get five signatures and not the other five? Didn't that just strike you as odd? You know, why wouldn't you want the whole council to do it? Bad advice from corporate counsel, probably. The next part is the memorandum of understanding. That's great. I mean, you know, I don't have a problem with Miss Merritt being the, you know, city administrator or acting city administrator, but he doesn't have the authority to do that. And he doesn't have the authority to take your power away. What is the problem with you guys. Don't let him do that to you. You know, he wants his little star chamber there to be the ones that can fire her. You're the people that can fire her. You know, don't let him get away with it. If you guys vote for this, then you're just voting to let the mayor be the strong mayor and a weak council. So have at it. Do what you want. But people are going to remember. And when it comes time to pay the piper, I think you guys will be paying a lot more. Thank you. Anyone else? Will Alderman please move the resolution? So moved. Second. Okay.

Essentially, those quotes are good for 24 hours. So when we get the quotes in the morning, we have to approve them within 24 hours. So that is how we do that every day. Do not disrupt this or you'll be asked to leave. Thank you. The idea that somehow we are not financially stable right now. You could look at the results of the bond sale to prove that. You could look at our bond rating going up. You can look at our budget and our budget awards. I know. I understand. You don't want to hear this. I understand that. Okay. But. But somebody. But somebody has to tell you the things that you're saying are untrue, even though. Even if you continue to say them publicly. Okay. And also to.

Thank you. Thank you, your honor. So to continue, we found ourselves without a city administrator and until we can hire a new city administrator, we needed somebody to run the city through executive order. The mayor said that was Miss Merritt. And Miss Merit has been doing that for five or six months. However long that period is, she has done it. She has done the job well. She has fulfilled her duties and she deserves to be paid what she agreed to be paid for taking on those duties, okay? And that's what we're doing here. And I have not heard anybody on the council say that she has not fulfilled her duties, that she has not done a good job, because she has. And so my opinion is we need to keep to the facts and ratify this. Give her what she is due because she fulfilled her end of this bargain. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Grip. Alderman Schulz. Thanks, mister mayor. Just simply, I'm supportive of Alderman Grip's comments. I'm supportive of Miss Merritt, and thank you. Thank you, Alderman Kelly. Thank you. I want to start with notice we don't say warn, you. Notice we don't say tell you. Y'all notice some of these people over here coming unglued. I sit over here and I don't say anything. But this is why we're doing code of conduct. Cause here I go. This is some bullshit. Some straight up bullshit. And I'm gonna call it spade a spade, mister. Write that down. Please. Don't say no. Write that down. Alderman Kelly said that. Write it down, jasmine. I sure did. Cause I'm telling you, this is nuts that we have to sit here week after week and you guys get mad at them. And then you could hear it in your voice when you try to give a rebu. Are we rebuttal? Is this a courtroom? I'm confused. I am confused. And I'm not going to knock her. But I can tell y'all about some things that I have had to deal with in this building and don't feel comfortable. I didn't come here last week because I damn near had a mental breakdown trying to come to council. What? Nothing wrong with me. I just couldn't breathe. I was hyperventilating and I couldn't come in this building. Do you think they care? I'm gonna stop because I'll keep going. But I'm just telling you, this is crazy to have somebody sit up here and tell you you have been warned. Warned for what? Are you, my daddy? And then the next one, co signing. And I'm gonna tell you what you gonna tell me you ain't telling me nothing. And then you wonder why you guys turn off the way they turn off when you're up here talking. Hmm? If we don't have the mutual respect of each other, that when somebody's speaking, we ain't gonna get nowhere. This ship is gonna go the same way. So y'all know I don't drink the Kool aid. Know that? Thank you, Alderman Kelly. Anyone else? Alderwoman Joker. Sorry, Alderwoman Newton. Thank you, mayor. So I'm gonna share my thoughts on this matter. First and foremost, I agree with the people that process matters. To give the people a little bit of background, some of it's noted on a green sheet, some of it's not. Executive order was issued November 8 that appointed ICA merit as the interim as of November 17. Obviously, such was done because our administrator left the city of Davenport. Such did not come before the council in 2023. I've heard that there wasn't time for it, but there was time in December of 2023 to ratify three settlements.

Executive order was issued November 8 that appointed ICA merit as the interim as of November 17. Obviously, such was done because our administrator left the city of Davenport. Such did not come before the council in 2023. I've heard that there wasn't time for it, but there was time in December of 2023 to ratify three settlements. A new council was seated in January 2024, consisting of five new alderpersons, myself included. Sometime in January, January 23 of 2024, I was asked regarding hire's appointment. I had concerns. I did not sign. I raised those concerns, and thankfully, my concerns were thought out or listened to. And then subsequently, is when we received advice from outside legal accounts that these should be ratified. I do believe that things of this nature should always be done in the public unequivocally. No ands, ifs, or buts should be done in the public, should be done simultaneously. That is how government can be transparent and accountable to its people. Now, as I sat up here for multiple meetings where this has come forward, I have listened. I've listened to constituents. I've also listened to my colleagues. I understand my colleagues were elected by the people, whether of the city, entire city of Davenport, or their ward. A few comments that stood out last meeting from a colleague was whether or not, if we made the decision today and the decision was still a yes, then it should be ratified now. In part, I do agree that if we're thinking about it today and the conclusion remains the same, whether, you know, if we end up with the same place, but then I go back to the process does matter. Another constituent said that led the last meeting, that the appointment itself should be separate. I also agree with that. It's something that I've mentioned before, and I do think that today I will be requesting when I'm done speaking, assuming there's no one else that wants to speak for my colleagues, that we motion to separate the two. So that the actual appointment is a vote in and of itself, and then the MOU is a separate vote in and of itself. And then today I've heard from constituents and. And some of the comments made that I think about and agree with is that process matters, that we have to do better, that the public has lost trust in Davenport. And it's unfortunate. It really is. When I ran for office, I ran because I wanted to make my community better. But little did I know that it would be in breaking in shambles or that it would be like trying to turn the Titanic around. Trying to do my best. I have faith that my colleagues are also trying to do their best with the cards that we have been dealt and trying to move this city forward. I do think it's a difficult position that some of us have been placed in because not only did we not have knowledge of everything that took place last year, we're being asked now to make decisions and go retroactively to November of 2023. With that said, I would motion that item number two be divided or separated. And whereas it would be two votes, the first would be the resolution ratifying executive order 23 2022. Excuse me, 23 22, appointing Mallory Merritt as the interim city administrator. And then a second would then be a resolution regarding the personal memorandum of understanding between the city of Davenport and Mallory. Merit. Do I have a second? A second. Okay, there's a motion and second to separate the two as read. Is there any discussion? This amendment. Right. Sorry, no discussion. I apologize. Call the roll for the separation amendment. McInnes. Yes. Job. Gin. Yes. Berkholder. Yes. Newton. Yes. Kelly. Yes. Reinartz. Yes. R. Dunn. Yes. Grip. Yes. And T. Dunn. Yes. Nine yeses, your honor. Very good. They're separated. Okay. Any other discussion on the original resolution? We'll do the first one, the executive order. Very good. Okay. Please, all the woman. Newton. Okay. So now my thoughts on the executive order specifically. So in light of the challenges facing our city, I personally believe that it would do our city well to have a fresh pair of eyes bringing someone completely new that hasn't been here, that has no involvement or even alleged involvement in anything would be helpful. But that is when referring to someone in a permanent capacity as a permanent city administrator. I'm happy to hear that the search for city administrator is well underway. I look forward to seeing that on the agenda next week so we can move forward in securing a new permanent city administrator. Today we're looking at an interim city administrator. And prior to assuming the role, ICA Merritt has in fact been the assistant city administrator. So, in looking at that decision, I do believe she was the logical choice in November. And I do believe she continues to be the logical choice today. I've heard from many of you that is not the issue that the people have. So I will be supportive of that. Thank you. Honorable. Anyone else? Okay, the first vote will be the resolution on the executive order. Mister Krupp, please call the roll. Berkholder. Yes. Grip. Yes. Ardan? Yes. Reinartz? Yes. McInnes? Yes. Newton? Yes.

As mentioned previously, I do believe that something like that should have been handled when it came forth, meaning in 2023. I do agree with many constituents that we should go to the table, and if an agreement is made at all, it should be one that's made by this new council. In looking at the actual memorandum. While I am limited on what I can discuss, because obviously it is personnel, the one thing that I will mention that I have a personal strong conviction against is the terms where the only way for the interim administrator to be let go would be by a unanimous vote of the chairs pro tem and the mayor. I don't think that is correct. I can not in good faith, ever support something like that. My vote is not worth any more than my colleagues to the right or my colleagues to the left. So. And I do believe that the law is set in that way for a reason. So I do have strong objections to that provision in the MoU. Thank you, Alderman Newton. Alderman Jones. Thanks, mister mayor. I agree with that. I don't know if now is the time to make a motion to maybe amend the MoU to include some language. Are we not able to do that? That has to be discussed in personnel. That's why I asked. Thank you. And to clarify, am I correct? Correct. Okay. Anyone else? Okay, mister Krupp, please call the rail on the MoU. Newton. No. Job. Gin? Yes. Burke. Holder. No. R. Dunn. Yes. T. Done. No. Grip. Yes. McInnes. Yes. Reinartz. Yes. And Kelly? No. Looks like five yeses and four nos, your honor. Right, so we need six to pass, so the MOU is not approved. Okay, next. Ladies and gentlemen, please. Thank you. Okay, item three, resolution approving amendment one to the personal memorandum of understanding between the city of Davenport and Mallory. Mallory. Is there any public with comment? Yeah, I just want to please name more. Gary Ekland. Ladies and gentlemen, please refer for talking in the audience. Gary Eckland, live in Davenport. I want to again speak out against this. I know one of the people is absent today. And I wouldn't direct comments directly to that person, but they did inspire some thinking. And if the owner of any kind of business went out of town, let's say their father was dying. Like that woman who came down here crying a few weeks ago. Her father was dying and the city was very vicious and cruel to her. And she was thinking about moving out of town. Sometimes people have to take care of personal families. So let's say the owner of a business had to go out of town for a little while. And they were in another part of the country caring for a dying relative. And they owned a business. And the manager of that business promised the assistant manager that they could each have $50,000 because they're covering the owner, because the owner's out of town. And the assistant manager said to the manager, well, you know, maybe we need the permission of the owner of the business before we promise each other $50,000. And they said, no, no, I'm the manager. You're the assistant manager. And they're sure the owner controls the money and makes the decision. But she's out of town and, you know, we can each give each other $50,000. After all, we're working hard. We deserve it. The owner would not come back and say, well, you guys promised each other $50,000 of my money. And you didn't think you had to ask me or get my permission? I'm not giving you $50,000. I'm paying you exactly what you get paid. Maybe I would have given you a small bonus and said, thank you, but I'm not even going to give you that now. You think you're going to just give yourselves $50,000 worth of money? It's insane, the idea that they can get this money. And they were participants in everything.

Maybe we let a Native American who survived the genocide have one of the jobs. That's a quota system. But we also have a quota system that right now that says 100% of every department head is going to be white, college educated person. Except we'll let a black woman head the civil rights commission. But we won't necessarily. We'll put a no girls sign or no black girls sign outside our little club and we won't let her in. This whole thing is ridiculous. It's time to just say no.

Personally, I'd like to ask this woman to resign and move on. But I tell you what. People praise these city workers and say they want continuity. I don't want continuity with a decision making process. That said, different rules for higher class citizens, different rules for low lives. That's what killed the people at 324 Main street. The decision making at the top of the city government and all the people involved should have the decency. They should have had the decency to resign a year ago. They should never work in government again. They should never work in personnel again. That's my position. Thank you. Next, please. Judith Lee, second ward. First of all, I have a question. Because it went so fast, are we on number three on the agenda? Okay, so first of all, your last vote just gave the mayor the authority to do executive orders that are substantive. And I have said for weeks now that I don't believe he has the authority to do that. And I'm afraid that you just leave. We're item number three, please. So. Number three. Thank you. Number three, we are now voting on a memorandum of understanding and amendment where you voted not to have a memorandum of understanding. So now you've got an amendment to something you voted down. So this isn't a logical decision. And I also want to say the MoU for Mister Hyer says, this agreement is not a contract of employment, and no provision hereof shall be construed to affect the employees at work will status if his is not a contract of an employment. Miss Lee, please state a miss merits. I am. Okay, then what is Miss Merritt's mou? How are they different? If his states explicitly it is not a contract of employment, so how is hers different? So what I'm seeing then, is a real problem with the mayor having too much power when he does not have that power, and you're giving it to him, and you just did with ratifying an amendment about Miss Merritt that had no authority for that executive order to even exist. There are ways to do that. I asked last August, what is the status of hiring a new corporation counsel? Because we knew he was leaving. And I was yelled at by the corporation counsel saying, that's a personnel matter. But that was a council matter. This is a council matter and your job is to be strong counsel. And they had plenty of time. They knew October 6 that she was leaving and you knew that she was leaving. October, November, December, January, February, March. We could have had a search going for the company and we could have had a city administrator in place with plenty of time. And that did not happen. So instead they said, we don't have time. You folks have to cover our behind. We don't have time to do it right, but you will have time to do it over. This has nothing to do with Mismerrit. This has everything to do with process authority and power and doing the right thing. You cannot vote for this amendment to an MOU. You just voted down. And I will be astounded if you approve this. It just is not the right process and none of this is the right process. And this amendment also has a statement that says, if this isn't working, we can do it over. Why don't you just do it right the first time? Why don't you drop this whole charade and do it right when the amendment says you can do that? And that's the amendment you're looking at right now, it gives you permission to do it right and do it right the first time. I want you to consider that. Thank you. Thank you. Mister Hyer, do you have something? Yeah, I just wanted to point out exactly what was just said. Item three on the agenda is an amendment to the MoU that was just voted down. So item three is really moot. However the council wants to deal with it, okay? That's up to the council. And we're in public comments, so the council will deal with it when they get through the council. So next, please. It's that great legal advice we keep talking about. Since we were rebutting things, Miss Lacy. Put the record. Just state who you are. Latrice Lacy. Fitfwart. The clarification was that there's nobody in this building who does assessments. But we have a city assessor. Yeah, he's not housing this building, but we have one and we're paying him. And he makes more than I do. As a property owner within the city, I can tell you that my taxes have gone up. I can tell you that bonds are leveraged against property taxes. Those are all factual statements. Miss Lacy, please stay. I'm going to go back to. Okay, I'm going to go back to the obvious thing. Why are we even discussing something that we voted down? Perhaps if we had effective counsel, they would have stopped you before you started. Thank you. Next, please. My name is David Ezra Sidron. I live in the third ward. I just. I'm not an attorney and I know what you're doing is stupid, illegal and wrong. I defer to miss Lacey. Who said the obvious? That you're going to vote on an amendment to something you've already voted down. Who's in charge of this circus? Okay, anyone else? Okay, let's see. We'll go.

Will an alderman please move the resolution? So move. Second. Okay, motion. Second. Any discussion from alder folks? I see. Alderwoman Newton, I don't think that item number three, which is a resolution approving an amendment, amendment one to the personnel memorandum of understood. Should be voted on. I think the appropriate action at this time would be to table the amendment and or delete it. Obviously, I've heard from constituents that they would like this council to do the contract, do it the right way. And I do think that that is the appropriate next step. So whether we table the amendment and then substitute it with a brand new contract or delete the amendment and then let a brand new item come before, I would ask our legal counsel which is the best procedure for doing such, but I don't think that this should be voted on. The proper thing would be to move to delete it from the agenda. Okay. I moved to delete item number three, the resolution approving amendment one to the personal MoU. From the agenda. Second by Kelly. Okay, there's a motion and a second to delete. There's no discussion on deletion. So, Mister Krupp, please call the roll for deletion of item number three. Job Jim. Yes. Ardudd. Yes. McInnes. Yes. Kelly. Reinartz. Yes. Burkholder. Yes. T. Dunn. Yes. Newton. Yes. And grip? No. Eight yeses and one no, your honor. Very good. The item number three is deleted. The next issue is number four resolution ratifying Executive Order 2401, appointing Brian Heyer's interim corporate counsel, and approving the personal memorandum of understanding between the city of Danport and Bryant Heyer, memorializing Mister Hyer's appointment and his interim corporate counsel. Is there any public comment? Mister, do not get near the dais, please. Thank you. Lakota, Dixon, seven more. I just want to say this by number three, how is the community supposed to trust y'all when something like that was. I believe that it was almost nut through. I just want to point that out from a person that is a first year and I consider myself of not a first grade city hall comer. I think that you guys just proved how dishonest, you know, some things come across that should have just been shot down before you even had public discussion. So I think that was kind of sneakily done. I'm not gonna go through all this again. I just think that y'all know how I feel about the situation. Please stay to number four, ma'am. Too late. I already said everything I had to say. Gotcha. Have a nice evening. You already know how I feel about the situation. Stop it, y'all. Y'all making me laugh. You already know how I feel. Y'all know how other feeling behind me, too. So I hope that we can just cut it short, but. No, no, don't cut it short. Y'all give them hell. Thank you. Next please. Jesus. You'll stop me after I'm doing Gary Ekland. I live in Davenport, Iowa. I was late getting in here and so that's why I ran these over. I'm hoping that you can pass these photographs or photocopies down. These are all directly related to this man's qualifications for the job. People who have been paying attention have heard me speak about things, how the city declared, how the city showed up in my yard after Easter Sunday in 2021 and told me, Mister Eklund, please refer to number four. I am. I am. I was told that the city was in my backyard because white landlord who lives in Bettendorf had complained that he was forced to rent to black people who he doesn't like. Mister Eklund, last time. And, well, then at some point I ended up speaking face to face with this gentleman. And I also had multiple written correspondence, as the mayor remembers. I'm sure. I gave the mayor two letters. I gave the city human resources directors two letters. I gave the city administrator, former city administrator, one letter. Copies of all of those letters were provided to this particular legal person in person, face to face, handed by me to him along with plenty of other documents. He was directly involved in the course of events. That city staff said to me that they were not focusing on white landlords, they were. Please sit down. Please sit down. The city this. Please sit down. He ordered that. Mister, we're talking about ratifying. Please sit down. No, please sit down. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, chief. Sorry. Thank you, ma'am. You may. Next, please.

As far as I can tell, the last remaining attorney with a valid employment contract in the city of Davenport legal department is Misses Bagby. As far as I can tell, she should be sitting over there. So why is Mister Hyer sitting over there? And why is the city council about to vote on a resolution giving him $50,000? To explain the long history of corruption in the city of Davenport would take far longer than the few minutes that I have been allotted. Let me just say that back in the 1890s, brothel owners and barkeeps had to pay their kickbacks directly to the Davenport Police Department right here in city hall. This is true. Maybe even in this very room was where they had to make the payoffs. It was somewhere on this first floor. Mister Sedren, please. This room has seen a lot of corruption over the years. Let's end it tonight. No more payoffs, no more kickbacks. No more secret deals. I beg the city council to put an end to this corruption. Now, tonight, forever. Vote no for a payoff for Mister hire. Make a statement. Do the right thing. No payoff or hire. I just want to say one other thing. When I was speaking to the House oversight committee, after I spoke, every legislator got up and came to me and wanted to shake my hand and wanted to thank me for everything I've done. And all I've done is what every citizen should do. Stand up. Do the right thing. It's easy to do the right thing. And I gotta tell you, the legislature is fed up with the city. It is fed up with the city council. It is fed up with the mayor. Thank you. Next, please. Judith Lee, second ward. This is the exact same as the number two. So I would ask you to do the separation like you did with the first one, the number two, and vote on the executive order and the MoU separately. Two again, the I'm going to say the EO was not illegally owed. Why are we letting the mayor run this city when it is not his job? The comments I have made previously, including the last couple of weeks, apply to this one as well. Our former and current legal department mayor and lane and Waterman, as outside counsel, have put the city of Davenport into a very difficult, unnecessary, extremely expensive, and consistently losing set of situations. Mister Hyer has treated alderman rudely, provided what I believe to be ill considered, and I also believe incorrect administrative legal advice. Constantly fought providing FOIA documents in violation of state law, including to me, and has created and contributed to multiple situations that have landed us in litigation. Even worse, I'm supporting what Doctor Sydron said. He is. He is a fake employee in violation of his 2022 irrevocable. You know what that word means? You cannot revoke it. Separation agreement with a city giving him certain benefits. He is no longer a city employee. He does not have the authority or ability to revoke that separation agreement. He is probably violating state retirement laws and he's collecting wages and benefits to which he is not entitled. He should not be sitting in that chair based on an invalid executive order and an MoU, which I again ask you to separate out. In reality, I believe that the council and human resources. How's your phone look? Grip. The council and human resources should be clawing back. Everything. Please. Ultimate grip. Everything of value that was not granted in his separation agreement, including wages, paid, vacation time and money, sick leave, and he should be walked out of this room. He is not an employee. You have the authority to decide to continue the use of outside counsel and or release that outside counsel contract and put out an RFP for a new one until a permanent corporation counsel can be hired. If Mister hire is so good, he can open his own company and he can apply for that RFP. Outside counsel can assist any new personnel without incorporating the current bad habits into the legal department. I've already talked about this agreement is not a contract. So I'm going to say I also have a very strong concern with clause 15. Under termination, hire can only be terminated for conviction of a criminal violation. Criminal violation? And with a unanimous vote of the four chairs and the pro temp. That is crazy. He could be in prison and still be acting according the way this MoU is written.

Yet only one alderman was in place in November, and the mayor managed to get a vote on ratification of the three settlement agreements for nearly $2 million by December 13. They could have been searching for a new corporation counsel and assistant attorney in 2022 when both Hyer and Warner signed their separation agreements for early 2023. Spiegel's agreement was signed in October. Why didn't we start the search for all of them then? Six months ago, we would not be in this position from the dais. As I said, I requested an update, and I got angrily yelled at by the corporation counsel because that was a personnel matter, and then they did nothing about it. I was on counsel. They did nothing about it. They knew then, and they know now. This is a city made crisis, and it's being blamed on you new council members because they are, you are, quote, reluctant to break laws and cover for bad management. And I believe in illegal problems. Thank you, ma'am. Next, please. Next, please. Lashana, 67 ward. I am here just again to beg, lead again, that you guys just do the right thing. I don't know how many times people have to tell you guys that this is illegal. Okay, I agree with the separating in two. Okay? Separate it. Vote on one, vote on the other. I mean, if I didn't care about my city, I wouldn't be up here, like, begging guys to separate it and vote on them separately. Some of you guys, I really, really, really do like some. So protect yourselves. Protect the city. Let's get back to believing in Davenport, right? I think that was a good subject we had last about three months ago. Another thing is, there's no more back room deals. We need to stop that. Strong city council, weak mayor, I think we're already kind of showing that you guys are doing good today, but let's do what's good for all of us, not just one or two. Thank you so much. Thank you. Next, please. Latrice Lacy, piff. Warren, I urge you to vote no on this not only does he not deserve a bonus, he does not deserve to be here. I know you shut down Mister Eklund because he was talking about the racism that goes on here in the city of Davenport. I guess, Gary, I get to be the representation of the descendant of a survivor of the trail of tears and the black person descendant of a lynched person. Because Davenport doesn't believe in diversity, inclusion, or equity. You have a city attorney who supervises someone who regularly engages in slander. He regularly engages in slander, libel. You were so worried about white people being defamed, or, I'm sorry, deflamed. But no one cares if it's done to a person of color that's under this person's supervision. Last week, emails went back and forth to you all accusing me and Doctor Sydron of engaging in unethical and arguably illegal conduct. Where was your city attorney? Nowhere. High five in his subordinate who? He gave a $40,000 raise. $30,000. Sorry. Why are you all allowing this? Why? You have someone who certainly subjected you to liability. Because your city attorney doesn't believe in reeling anyone in. As long as they're doing it to black people, who cares? And you don't want to hear about it because you're okay with it. That's why it was Alderman Kelly's responsibility to call out somebody for using the n word. That's why there was no findings to the investigation that was done. That's why the city attorney couldn't conduct an investigation. Please. That's why the city attorney has allowed this to continue. That's why Alderman Kelly doesn't have his legal fees paid. Because that's under the supervision of your city attorney. That's why you told me. Well, because you filed a complaint with the EEOC. We're not going to address this. Your attorney should tell you. Don't say that. That's retaliation. That's illegal. But what was he doing? High fiving. Because he agrees with it. Because he believes in engaging in retaliation. He believes in misusing his authority, his position, and he's allowing his subordinate to do the same. Most of the corruption that we hear about is at the advice of this buffoon, Miss Lake. The same way. Please don't call names. We. It should be his name, but. Okay. This is the reason why there was this vote, please. That's why we have it. This doesn't make any sense. That this person has been allowed to engage in the behavior that we have seen. They're allowed to be unprofessional. They're allowed to refuse to do their job because I don't like Latrice. She asks too many questions. That's crazy. That's childish. That's a dereliction of your duties. And he's still employed even though he signed an irrevocable agreement saying he would no longer be employed. He should be advising you that he can't continue to be paid after signing an agreement that's irrevocable. But what's he doing? Hey, give me $50,000. Thank you. When is enough? Where's the end? At what point are we willing to say, let's stop this experiment? It's gone terribly off the rails.

Thank you. Next please. Sheryl Shagna, third ward. I think if we could give him evaluation of the last six months or last year of his performance on the job, I think that on a scale of zero to ten, he'd probably have a solid zero because of the number of lawsuits that have just been generated in this last six months to a year, which are extremely self serving and job security. You know, it makes so little sense that my brain has trouble wrapping around it. Just so you know, when y'all look@that.org chart of the city, it has the people up on top, Mister Grip. Below the people are the alder people. And then next to that is the city admin and the city attorney. He had written in his agreement that his termination is not only unanimous by the department's head, also by the city administrator is included in that. How in the heck did the city administrator get included in the firing or the termination of the legal department? Except the legal department wrote this agreement himself, Mister Grip, and I'm not positive. Please refer to the council's accounts. I wish the respect, you know what, you have decorated forum rules for Hus, and those rules only apply right there. Treat others with respect when you are not looking at us, when you are talking, when you are leaning back and sighing, when you are looking down. That is not respect. I am doing my best to address everyone. I dont want to call the entire group a moron, because theyre not. But you got a couple morons in the group that dont seem to grasp what's happening here. You want to give him $50,000 bonus. I'm not supposed to say his name, but yet he's the object or the subject of the line item we're voting on in 2020. He was, in fact, noted that he was paid more than other people doing the same job in other cities. But you want to give him more money in the home of election deception, because information was not provided to the voting part. That allowed us to make good decisions when we went to the polls this past year. Election deception. And he was quite aware of it. He was leading you on how to deceive the people in this city. And you continue to deceive by not providing the agreements, by not giving us the requests, you determine or allow him to determine why someone should get or not get a request. That is a load of crap and you all know it. There have been people up here saying he has got in their face and screamed at them recommending to say, yes. I can't do it in good conscience. You voting yes. You should not say yes in good conscience. Did you feel that busy new council members on that quote? Did any of you watch that hearing when the people in Des Moines said they had not seen anything more egregious in 50 years? What about that did you not get? Are you delusional? Corruption is not just for money. It's also for power. Okay, so if your head is in the sand, get it out of the sand. Pink slip higher. Don't give him a bonus. Why didn't you let him retire? We can't continue the status quo that we have now. Recent lawsuits have gone against us, against the city. If it continues in the same way, I'm going to give his performance and evaluation a negative number. He's costing us a lot more money. And twisting what I said last week about legal and how much money we're spending on our legal department. We're spending way too much money on outside to be paying what we're paying for inside. Figure it out. It doesn't take a blind man to see it. So, yes, if your head is in the sand, please pull it out. Boat. No, to give the money to someone that sucks at his job. Thank you. Next, please lay in salmon 8th board, I'm asking you to vote no. I know many of you have children and grandchildren, and don't you want a city for them to grow up in where they are not going to be in debt by the time they turn 18? Because that's the road we're heading down if we keep giving out all of these illegal bonuses, all these illegal separation agreements. I have five kids and 18 or five kids and 13 grandchildren, and I don't even want them to live in our city anymore. And I used to love this city. But you people are making it so hard. And when we start the meetings, we say, if you give us respect, we give you respect. I appreciate those of you that look up, but those of you that keep looking down, you're on work time.

Boat. No, to give the money to someone that sucks at his job. Thank you. Next, please lay in salmon 8th board, I'm asking you to vote no. I know many of you have children and grandchildren, and don't you want a city for them to grow up in where they are not going to be in debt by the time they turn 18? Because that's the road we're heading down if we keep giving out all of these illegal bonuses, all these illegal separation agreements. I have five kids and 18 or five kids and 13 grandchildren, and I don't even want them to live in our city anymore. And I used to love this city. But you people are making it so hard. And when we start the meetings, we say, if you give us respect, we give you respect. I appreciate those of you that look up, but those of you that keep looking down, you're on work time. We need a basket that says, put your phone here, put your tablet here so we can have respect. And we will give you respect. It's a two way street. It should not be you guys against us. Us against you. We are supposed to be united and we're not. Because this phantom train of money that just keeps rolling down the tracks for some people, just dropping them out of who knows where is causing a bigger divide. We want our city back. We are never going to get back. The people from 324 Main street, the people that lost everything that day, is never going to get anything back. The people that were taken out of the building, the shriker, are never going to get that back. But you guys want to take more money out of the pockets of people who are suffering, to put them in the pockets of those who are not. I have no ill will towards these people whatsoever. But I want a city that we can live in where there's no corruption, where there's no division. We're supposed to tell our children, get along. We're supposed to be the examples. It's not go along to get along. It's do the right thing so we can grow, so we can move on. We are never going to recover from that collapse. We're never going to get those people back. But you guys have the opportunity to start over. Because I feel bad for all you new ones that were thrown into this. You didn't know the crap storm you were coming into. You just came in wanting to do the right thing for Davenport. And you're thrown into damned if you do, damned if you don't. Sorry, I don't like to cuss, but there's no other way to say it. This sucks for all the new people and for the residents. And we want our city back. So please, vote no. Thank you. Next, please. Gary Johansson, first Ward. I gotta ask for all of you to say no on this, simply because it just doesn't make any sense. And the new information I just heard sort of makes me sick to my stomach. There's no $50,000 to anybody who apparently doesn't work here. I'm not sure which is sad that I don't know. The city of Davenport is the people that live here. It's us. We're being sued because of what our leadership did or didn't do. I have no idea. Who gets evaluated? Who evaluates the person in the job, who evaluates the city administrator, who evaluates who is responsible for all of this? Does the city administrator? I don't know. And y'all gonna have to do the right thing. And I've said this before, but seriously, no. $50,000 for the man. That's all I got. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else? Next, please. Blacksy Hopkins and I live in the 6th ward. I look at the situation with attorney hire differently than I do with Miss Merritt. I think that he has resigned. I would like to see you accept his resignation. And I hope that he can find a job someplace else. I think his disposition is not right for this. I think we paid money to people who made accusations of being treated poorly as staff, but yet we don't learn from that. If we allow someone to treat staff the way attorney hire treated them. So that's the end of what I have to say. I just think. Accept his resignation. Thank you. Anyone else? Next, please. Derek Cornett, 7th ward. I have the same objections as I did on number two for Mister Hyer. It's all about process, and the process wasn't followed correctly. Again, don't give up your authority, your power as councilmen. Don't let the mayor direct how the council operates. It's not in your best interest. It's not in the best interest of the city, and especially your constituents. Thank you. Anyone else? Okay, next, please. Thank you, your honor. McBride, fifth board. I just like to stand with my community and urge you all to vote no. The bad legal advice that we just experienced. We all just witnessed a case in point. Why would we pay for that? Why are we still. If he's not even under contract, why is he sitting there? The harassment, threats, intimidation. We've had enough. Like, how? Unethical behavior. How much more can we tolerate? We are tired of it. We have had enough. We have complained to you guys. We've shared our concerns. We're still dealing with it. Day in and day out. Get rid of him. He's already gone. As far as the contract goes, make it official. Thanks. Thank you. Anyone else? Next, please. Yes, my name is Genevieve Brafferty.

We have four public hearings this evening. One under community development, one under public works, and two under finance. We'll start with community development. Alderman Grip and Alderman Reinerts will discuss. Alderman Grip, please. Thank you, your honor. Before I open the public hearing, I'm gonna take the chair's privilege and ask director Berger to come up and do a presentation on this proposed conditional conveyance, as requested by Alderwoman McGinnis. Bruce Brooker, community and economic development. So the public hearing tonight is on the Riverview Heights housing project. So it's in the 700 block of East 6th street. And I thought I'd just give you a quick, real quick history. I've just got, like, three, four slides. Those are the six lots originally those back in the 1960s. There were single family houses on each of those. We've had a couple of attempts over the last couple of decades to solicit either proposals or entertaining options to redevelop those properties. The most recent was in 2017. We did another conditional conveyance to a local development team to do six single family homes. So when they actually took acquisition, replatted it to those six properties, they weren't able to get across the financing threshold with it. And we had a reversion clause similar to what's in the proposal for this project that allowed it to revert to us, and so that's how we came back into possession of it, I think, in 2019. The current proposal is, again, by a respected local development team. They propose four buildings with four units each, which would be 16 units total. They'd be accessed off the rear, which is 7th street. It is a very narrow street, so. And I'll cover that here in a sec. The appraised value of those six parcels was done here a few years back at 38. It's currently assessed at 36. They're offering 38. It's conditional because of those aspects that they'd like to accomplish before they close on the property. So one of those is rezoning. The current zoning only allows duplexes. The developer also, I mentioned 7th street behind the property, which really looks and functions mostly like an alley. That's how they would service the properties. So folks would access their garages from that street. And it's a brick street and historic, and so they probably need to do a lot of work to rehab it. And so they anticipate coming through for both a sidewalk waiver and a brick street waiver that needs to go through HPC and Ul. So there would be other actions for them to go through before they would actually take possession. And then workforce housing credits is something that might come before this body here in another month. That is a state housing tax credit, and I understand that that is a requirement for their funding as well. So. And that would be announced usually in the summer months. So. So if all that would be successful, their timeline has them acquiring the property in fall, starting by the spring, and then hopefully", "answer_v2": "[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Riverview Heights housing project\",\n    \"positives\": [\n      \"Respected local development team involved\",\n      \"Proposal includes four buildings with four units each, totaling 16 units\",\n      \"Appraised value of parcels is $38,000, matching the offer price\",\n      \"Plans to rehab historic 7th street for access\"\n    ],\n    \"negatives\": [\n      \"Conditional on rezoning and work on historic 7th street which functions mostly like an alley\",\n      \"Requires sidewalk waiver and brick street waiver\",\n      \"Dependent on workforce housing credits from state, which are not yet secured\"\n    ],\n    \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n    \"comment\": \"The project has potential with a respected local team and plans for development.

I think that's all I have. All right, thank you. I open the public hearing on the proposed conditional conveyance of city owned property located in the 700 block of East 6th street for the Riverview Heights housing project to Riverview Heights, LLC. Is there anyone from the public who's here to comment on this item? Gary Eckland. I live at alderman Kelly's ward. I really appreciate the presentation. It does add more specificity to what the proposal is, and I want to speak against it. If this was six single family homes, that would be one thing. I think we have enough apartment buildings. I think we give enough money to landlords. I think we have enough landlord favoritism and anti poor homebuyer. I'm going to be calling soon for certain institutions, the city, the county, Palmer Genesis, St. Paul's Lutheran, St. Ambrose, to build the exact same number of houses that they've demolished previously. And this would be an excellent site to put six single family homes. They could give them away with a $25,000 escrow account for future repairs, and they could waive the property taxes for ten or 15 years, like they do for unwealthy people. I think there's enough apartment buildings. Another thing that the city could do with these six specific lots, which would make them far more available for people to live on as homeowners and home buyers, is they could legalize the placement of single family trailers, such as you find at trailer parks, to be put on a lot, and so that a person could buy those lots or get in line to have it conveyed at whatever price or no price. And they could put a brand new or even a used, but, you know, up to code trailer on that lot, and they could legally live there and they wouldn't have to pay trailer rent, which is one of the drawbacks of, you know, living in a trailer park. It says, currently zoning only allows. Duplexes are, of course, single family. And I think, so you're going to be asked to change the zoning from single family to multi unit apartments. And I know if this proposal was to come before the city council and it was going to be right next door to almost any of the people on the city council, they would say no because they don't want the density of apartment dwellers. And essentially what I understood from his presentation is they want to make 7th street essentially into an alley, and they want to, you know, they want to not have to do the bricks, you know, which is whatever for the moment. But then they want a sidewalk waiver. And I happen to be down here because of what's going on. When we had an extreme amount of public meetings and public people coming down to talk, and they were about a daycare center that wanted a sidewalk waiver. And this daycare center, I forget. I think they got part of it anyway. But it was sort of like the daycare center has been there for years, the building's been there for years. And they had a lot of money to pay out for the sidewalks. Anyway, it was a big production. They didn't just come once. It seemed like they came for a couple months worried about a sidewalk waiver for that. Now we're talking about an inner city residential neighborhood where I no doubt have children who walk from their homes to be picked up by their school buses. And a lot of poor people don't have cars. Even. So they drive. They might walk from that neighborhood all the way up to Aldi's or the save a lot or whatever it's called right now. So you have people who walk through these neighborhoods and they're going to be asking for a sidewalk waiver for an existing sidewalk. I just think that this demonstrates the favoritism towards people who already have a lot of money. And like I say, if this was going in right next door to anybody on the city council, they would probably vote it down and they would say, no, we want single families in our neighborhood, and there's no reason why this couldn't be single family and homeowner occupied instead of rental. Is there anyone else here to comment on this public hearing? Please state your name and address or ward. Cheryl Shagna, third ward. Because Mister Berger spoke first. I do feel like I'm at a little bit of a disadvantage because typically staff will speak after us if we have a question.

They said he was local. I would like to know what other complexes they own and what their track record is with those complexes, if they've had any problems that have not been addressed.

How are you going to accommodate for that on the surrounding environment? You've got a parking lot for double, at least two cars per unit.

How are you going to accommodate for that on the surrounding environment? You've got a parking lot for double, at least two cars per unit. And so then that brings up the water drainage issues. And will you make this company build a retention pond? If in fact, all that water is going to drain down on the city and cause problems with that brick, how is this going to affect that neighborhood? Is it going to be an asset to the neighborhood or a detriment to the neighborhood by doubling the occupancy. And as they come in, it would be nice if they were an asset and they could actually do something for the neighborhood and maybe even put a little park in if they have the space to double what was in six lots and now put in six families homes. And turning 7th street into an alley is probably not the best idea. I do not have an alley where I live, and I can tell you it is not the best idea. Do we know the track record of this petitioner? Riverview Heights, LLC. And do we have plans in process that if we do have a landlord that is in fact a slum lord, that the city has the ability to remove their license before we have another 324 Main street building, do we have processes in place yet with our landlords that make sure that the communication is open between the public and the city so we do not have another 324 Main street building? Again, if our management and our property owners are out of state and out of the city, makes it very difficult for the city to have accountability over those owners. I would like to see, with the changes being made in the city and a new year, a new council, that these issues, these loopholes that allow slumlords to come into the city and do what they do, that that is stopped before it can happen. Again, proactive rather than reactive. And again, if I want to know what they're going to do for the city, other than what they're getting for themselves. I never heard the amount of money that's going to be conveyed for just a conveyance. The last conveyance didn't go good because they didn't get the funding part of the conveyance that came back to the city. That doesn't necessarily make the property hard to sell. It just means that that owner could not get financing. I don't think the property is actually hard to sell. So I want to know, and again, if we can get with Mister Berger to tell us what is the money amount of this conditioned conveyance that would be really helpful as a part of a public hearing to know, to have all the information, full disclosure, so people can make good decisions with all of the information.

I can answer several of those questions, or at least the ones I can remember. What we're planning to build and spend is $4.85 million on those four duplexes. They are a 50 50 mix of three bedrooms and two bedrooms. So we believe that that will attract a whole lot of families into that neighborhood. The three buildings furthest west will all have views of the river. And we think we're. You know, I've been aware of this land for some time, and we've tried a whole bunch of different things to make it work in their town. Homes, all kinds of things. And this is the only one we've been able to come up with after a whole bunch of years that actually we can make work there. I was born and raised in Waterloo, but have lived here since 1986, raised three daughters that all graduated from central high school and have gone on to be very successful people across the country. As far as my experience in real. And by the way, I am the managing member of Riverview Heights. I should have indicated that off the bat. I apologize. I haven't been involved in real estate since I left Deere in 1998. I currently still own the United Cigar building where me and Billy's restaurant is. I've owned properties in Cedar Rapids, Waterloo and Florida over that time period. I think one thing that makes me unique in this business is I believe that what I do is I don't rent apartments, I provide homes for people. And I think that gives me and my people a unique look at what they do. If you're a maintenance man and you treat a unit as a home of somebody, you just treat it differently. That's a kin new deer saying, we don't make farm machinery, we help feed the world. It gives them a better look at what they do. I don't think anybody's ever called me a slumlord. And I think this. Obviously, I'm up here thinking it's a very, very worthwhile project for the city, for the neighborhood, and for me. Thank you for your time. Is there anyone else from the public? All right. Seeing no one, I move to close the public hearing. There's a motion and a second. All in favor? Aye. Are there any opposed? This public hearing has been closed. Thank you, alderman. Grip. The next area is public works. Alderman Dunn and Alderman Kelly will discuss. Alderman Dunn, please. Thank you, your honor.

I would take the chair's privilege to request that our interim city attorney, merritt, please provide us an explanation of the budget. Thank you. Madam chair, it's my privilege and honor to present our community's FY 2025 budget to you this evening. In terms of process, this process really begins for us in the summer before the budget year kicks off. So, as you can see from this timeline, we formally kicked off the process in September, but there was a lot of work going on behind the scenes in July and August as well. I want to take an opportunity on this slide to thank Matthew Cullinan, who served as our lead analyst for the process this year. Also Basha Gerlach, who is our controller, and Jim Odeen, who is our acting finance director. They really took a leadership role in this process this year in meeting with the departments. And I appreciate all of the internal cooperation that led to getting us to this point with the budget that is before you, the highlights of this budget. It is a balanced budget. It's a stable budget. It complies with all of your financial policies and our liquidity targets that we have set. It lowers the property tax levy by seventeen cents to six dollars, sixty one cents per per thousand dollars of taxable valuation, which is our first time that we've lowered our property tax rate in many, many years. And then lastly, the budget that's before you is core competency driven. It advances your priorities as a city council. It advances the priorities that we've heard through community input processes, including the biannual community survey. And it continues to deliver our current service levels. So, in terms of the 25 budget message, I would encourage everyone to go online, as you have time, and look through the FY 25 adoption packet. You can find that on our website. In fact, if you just type in Davenport, Iowa budget, you click. I think it's the first link that comes up for you. It should be at the top of the page and you'll be able to read all about this. But some highlights for tonight, again, is that we are in an overall stable condition. Our major operating funds are growing, they're balanced, they're performing well with revenues exceeding expenditures. And then lastly, it continues the process that we've had in place for a number of years around conservative budgeting. So again, we anticipate this to be a very strong budget year for us that will continue the goals that you have set in terms of financial policies. This is further evidenced by our current bond ratings. As we spoke about last week and even the week before. Recently we received our updated ratings from both S and P and Moody's. Both of those organizations noted that we had a strong overall financial position, both assigned stable outlooks and both recognized our strong finances and budgetary flexibility, our reserves and our kind of general policies around liquidity. Lastly, of note on this slide, Moody's also assigned a g one rating, which is the best rating that you can get for governance, and they cited our budget management transparency and disclosures around our financials. The 2025 budget details here, the operating budget is up 4.3%. That's primarily due to contractual obligations for both employees and service contracts that we hold. Our capital budget, you will see is down 20.5%. That does fluctuate year to year and it's typically tied to what grants we are receiving in that particular year. And then our debt line is down 0.4%. And again, that's another area that can fluctuate year to year just based on past debt issuances and what principal and interest payments will be due in that budget year. So overall, your total budget is around 239 million and is down 1.4% over FY 2024. Property taxes. As I mentioned, the consolidated rate is $16.61 compared to the 24 budget of $16.78.

So overall, your total budget is around 239 million and is down 1.4% over FY 2024. Property taxes. As I mentioned, the consolidated rate is $16.61 compared to the 24 budget of $16.78. Fee adjustments for 25 the sewer fee by ordinance this is the final year that the ordinance provides for, so in FY 25 those rates will increase by 5%. We will be undertaking a rate study late summer to establish new recommended rates to you all as the city council, and then hopefully we would adopt that ordinance sometime November December, well ahead of our next budget process. And as we discussed during the budget workshops, I do anticipate that these rates will continue to be reduced over time. Both the solid waste and the clean water fees are proposed to be escalated at 3%, as has been customary for a number of years, and just helps us keep up with the cost of doing business. Our general fund unassigned reserves are also strong, sitting at 25%, which is the maximum allowed under the city council's policy. The policy is 17% to 25%, so again, 25%. And I do anticipate that to continue for both FY 24 year end and FY 25. Again, in terms of general fund budget assignment, you will see both of the orange pieces of the pie. The left represents revenues, the right represents expenditures. In the budgeting world, you really want the orange to stay in alignment. You never want your expenditures related to salaries and benefits growing faster than our tax base and the taxes that we're bringing in. And you can see that those are in alignment. I would also point out just as a note here, that this now includes all of the libraries expenditures which were previously housed in their own fund. So that will disrupt our trend data here for a year or two, but will eventually level out. So I did just want to note that that's perhaps why this slide looks a bit different than prior years. That's a similar story here as we look at general fund and trust and agency. Combined trust and agency is where we fund our contribution for police and fire pensions. And you will see that whenever we look at this combined again, our orange, we want those to stay in alignment in this case as well. And of the 80% salaries and benefits expenditures here, a little over 70% is related to our public safety personnel. So continuing to invest in that priority, that's been identified both by the community and by you as our policymakers moving into our CIP. The CIP program that is before you for FY 25 is about 39.4 million. You'll see on the left when we look at the navy and the gray pieces of the pie that represents our streets and sewers, which makes up a little over half of our total pie there. So again, this is just meant to show the breakdown and you can go online and research and read about all of the different projects that feed into this. Some highlights again, is just emphasizing large scale investment into both our street and our sewer network systems. I would note again that even in light of our conversation yesterday around the water pollution control plant, that that will be a significant undertaking that we conduct this year is to really evaluate the financing strategies around the equipment upgrades that are needed, and we'll be bringing back a recommendation for you with that kind of later this fall and about how to finance that. So again, a huge commitment, I believe, from both the council and the staff to continue to invest in streets and sewers as we've heard from the public. And then again, just to conclude, highlights balanced, stable budget, lowering our property tax rate by seventeen cents, and core competency focused. And lastly, I would just like to thank all of our staff, team, the department heads as well. Our six collective bargaining units are unions that we work very closely with. And lastly, you as the policymakers. This is a team effort to bring a budget over the finish line. It's the largest policy decision that you all make in a given calendar year, and it's really important as it serves as the basis and the guide of everything that we do here internally and externally. And I thank you for all of your guidance in this process. Thank you. Is there anyone from the public wishing to speak? So please step forward. State your name, address or award. Yeah, my name is Gary Eklin and I live in alderman Kelly's ward. I don't have time to study the budget. It's something that I had not wanted to do. I can tell you that in 2021, I honestly did not know the name of the mayor because I figured any vote that Pittsburgh people who make over $100,000 a year and people who make $7.25 a year, the votes were going to 100% go to the people over 100,000, and none of the votes would go to $7.25 an hour workers. And there's no point in me watching that when I know what my opinion is worth. On the other hand, I am here. And because I am here, you get to hear my opinion. I just heard that the property tax rate is going down. As a home buyer, it was explained to me back in seven, 8910 years ago that the property tax department automatically assumes that the poorest home buyers got an unreasonably fair deal, and so they double, triple, quadruple the property taxes that they pa", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"City Council's Budget Management\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Moody's assigned a g one rating, which is the best rating for governance.\",\n            \"Transparency and disclosures around financials are highly rated.\",\n            \"Operating budget up 4.3% due to contractual obligations.\",\n            \"General fund unassigned reserves at maximum allowed (25%).\",\n            \"Continued investment in public safety personnel (over 70%).\",\n            \"Large scale investment in street and sewer network systems.\",\n            \"Lowering property tax rate by 17 cents.\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [\n            \"Capital budget is down 20.5%\",\n            \"Debt line is down 0.4%\",\n            \"Fee adjustments: sewer fee to increase by 5%, solid waste and clean water fees to increase by 3%.\"\n        ],\n        \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n        \"comment\": \"While the city council's budget management shows strong governance, transparency, and prudent financial management, the increase in various fees and decrease in capital budget and debt line adds elements of concern.

And there's no point in me watching that when I know what my opinion is worth. On the other hand, I am here. And because I am here, you get to hear my opinion. I just heard that the property tax rate is going down. As a home buyer, it was explained to me back in seven, 8910 years ago that the property tax department automatically assumes that the poorest home buyers got an unreasonably fair deal, and so they double, triple, quadruple the property taxes that they pay. With the theory that the free market doesn't really reflect what the free market reflects, but somehow that people who got a $20,000 home should be paying property taxes on a 50 or 60 or $80,000 home. My rates, my assessment went up. I don't know if it doubled. I don't have it in front of me. I attempted to dispute my property tax assessment, but the property tax department mailed me a letter saying that my hearing was essentially already over. They didn't give me enough advance notice to. They didn't give me any advance notice. I told them that I was a low wage worker. I would need to take time off from work to attend my hearing, and could they please give me some notice so I could ask for the time off? And I received in the mail a letter saying that your hearing was two days ago, and I guess you should have been there. So my property taxes is not just going up. My property taxes may very well be doubling. And I want to mention again, I brought this up before, and this is one policy that I'm going to be asking the two aldermen at large and my own aldermen to look into, is how much money does the city spend on collecting the sewer and garbage bills versus how much money it brings in? And is this time before the next capital budget, not this one, but the next one, to eliminate the sewer and garbage bill? I think that this unfairly burdens the poor, wealthy people. People who make $100,000 a year on the government. They just write a check or they have automatic deposit. I'd be curious how many people last year had their sewer bill and garbage bills reported over to the property tax department for to take their house or to sell their house to investors. That's a serious thing for people who live at the bottom. I noticed on that thing, it said that certain things are going up 5% or 3% a year because that's expected. Minimum wage in Iowa and the federal government, $7.25 an hour. It has been $7.25 an hour in Iowa since George Bush junior was president. 0% raise for minimum wage workers, and yet 5% raises in their property taxes or whatever else I want to bring up. I know this one you guys are going to sail through, and I don't blame anybody for however they vote on this one. But next year, it's time to start planning for next year. Staff should be reduced dramatically. Wages should be reduced dramatically. I'm also. I'm asking regarding the sewer bills, I'm asking that the people you ask the departments to bring forward exactly how many staff members work on the sewer bills, how much computers are on the sewer bills, how much interaction, how much banking fees, how much postage, how much printing. This used to be on the property taxes. The theory was that the property taxes include the expenses. But then they had this brilliant idea that they could have more money for higher wages and more staff if they shifted the burden onto poor people and then kept the property taxes, saying the property taxes were reduced. My property taxes are probably going to double next year. They were already twice as much as they should have been based on the value of my house. But there is this discrimination across the board, including in the property tax department. The people from humility homes who run the shelter were down here recently, and I think they said they get 25, $50,000 a year from the city for all of the homeless people that they help house and the city's budget across the board constantly favors wealthy people. I noted in the quat city Times that $13 million of COVID money was spent to reduce lagoons that could have built. You could have built and given away, what, 5140, you know, $100,000 houses. You know, for $13 million, if you did ten houses, $100,000 each, that's 130 houses the city could have built and given away or built $75,000 and included a $25,000 property tax and repair escrow account. And, you know, you could have a kind of a lottery. It's not really fair, you know, but, you know, you could say, we're going to give away 100 houses that we've just built, and we'll have a lottery for everybody who's low income. All the money goes to the top and none of it goes to the bottom. And I do want to emphasize again to say that the property tax is going down. We need an investigation outside the city into the property tax department, into whether or not they intentionally overtax the poorest home buyers. Because if you buy a $20,000 house, because all the rich people look at it and say, well, $100,000 house is a whole lot better, and you buy the $20,000 house because you want to be a homeowner and this is the house that you can afford. It's not fair to say, oh, well, we think that should have been $100,000 house, or we think that should have been an $80,000 house. You know, you always hear about the free market, but you don't really live up to it. Lastly, I want to say one other thing that relates to this is how many people in the city drive city vehicles home? What are the names? What are their job titles?

You know, you always hear about the free market, but you don't really live up to it. Lastly, I want to say one other thing that relates to this is how many people in the city drive city vehicles home? What are the names? What are their job titles? And why are they driving city vehicles home? We're paying for gasoline for people who live in other cities to drive a city vehicle home every night. And I assume that we're paying for their gasoline to drive to the restaurants and to the movie theater and to everywhere else. Why is the city paying so many people who do not? You know, if the police chief, you know, needs to get up at 04:00 a.m. and run to something, you know, I can see the police chief and the fire chief if maybe they really respond at 04:00 a.m. but for the most part, if you're or no, our snow plow driver in the middle of the winter, who's going to get up in 6 hours and go back out on the road, and he drives a snow plow truck home, I got nothing against that. But if you're somebody who works a regular job, whether you're driving a city truck home or a city car home or an suv, I don't understand. I tried to calculate about how much money I think that's worth. I think that's essentially a $20,000 perk per year, per employee that the city is paying out. And I think the city leadership has kind of doled out vehicles as a perk. And I don't know whether they claim an extra. You know, if you paid $100,000 a year and then you get a $20,000 city vehicle worth of gasoline and insurance and car repairs and the car payments, you know, do they claim that on their, you know, do they report that to the IR's? You know, like, I didn't just make 100,000. I really made 120,000. But I'm really angry that I am paying for gasoline for people who have made racist statements to me to drive city vehicles to their homes in other cities. And not sure how to phrase this, but I'm talking about racial equity and people without college degrees. No, I'm trying to. That's what I'm trying to phrase. How unhappy I am that people are driving city vehicles to Bettendorf. And they don't even live in Davenport. They live in Bettendorf, or maybe they live out in the county. And I don't understand. The city of Bettendorf used to be a sundown town, and most people don't know what sundowntown is. But there's a reason why Davenport is more black and more mixed race than Bettendorf is. And I'm assuming the best in Bettendorf right now. Shearing is on the budget, Mister Eckland. Okay, well, I'm asking. I'm asking that you. I'm asking that you immediately take away all the city vehicles from people who drive them home, except for the police chief and the fire chief, and someone who is expected to get up. You know, if you own a private business and you have a repairman who's supposed to get up at 04:00 a.m. and drive a vehicle that has all these tools and stuff, and that makes perfect sense. Repairman drives the vehicle home, 04:00 a.m. gets up and goes to do the repairs. You have five receptionists. You don't buy your five receptionist vehicles and pay for their gasoline and their car insurance. You say, you know, drive your own vehicle. If you have to run to the store and buy his paper clips, I'll pay your gas mileage, you know, sixty seven cents a mile or fifty five cents a mile, whatever the federal rate is, but you don't buy him a car. So I'm asking that you take steps to eliminate the sewer bill and to put that back on the property tax burden. I am asking that the city provide information. How many people were turned over last year to the property tax department? Which again, people who make money don't ever have to deal with that kind of stuff. But if you don't pay your sewer bill on time, your garbage bill, then it goes to the property tax people, and then you have to pay all these extra fees and fines and your credit gets this. And then at some point, if you don't pay it, then they put it up for sale to tax investors who make all kinds of money and you have to buy it back from the property tax thing. And this is all people who are already paying probably twice as much of their fair share of the property tax. So the same people who are going to lose their homes to sewer bills are the same people who are paying twice as much as their fair share of the property taxes. Because right now the property taxes are not sincere and honest. The property taxes are intentionally, I believe intentionally, I believe that they intentionally overinflate the value of minimum low income home buyers. And if the whole thing is supposed to be that, you know, you buy a $20,000 house, you pay $20,000 taxes. You buy a $50,000 house, you pay $50,000 taxes. You buy a million dollar house, you pay a million dollar houses or taxes. You shouldn't automatically be saying, well, you got a $20,000 house, so we're going to charge you $80,000 for an $80,000 house. That's just ridiculous. But that's our property tax department. So if I can just finish the sewer bill, who drives vehicles home and why? And you could do that tomorrow. The city council could tomorrow say, I want to know exactly who drives a vehicle home and why? And then you could say, stop it. Stop it. They can drive their own vehicle.

Is there anyone else from the public wishing to address this item? Please state your name. Address. Reward. Hi, my name is Benjamin Bacher. I live in the 7th ward. I appreciate the work the city has done recently on trails and paths and hope we continue to do that. It would be nice if there's a way we could start adding more sidewalks in areas where there's clear pedestrian paths. Two weeks ago I was driving on Kimberly heading east by that Walmart and I had to swerve out of the lanes because there is a pedestrian walking down the side of the road because there wasn't a sidewalk there. But you can see there's a clear path walk mowed down like a cat, like a cattle path through the field there. And I appreciate the compost facility. I had his sewer work done on my front yard last year and then I was able to go to compost facility and get some compost and it was a good, reasonable price. And my front yard is looking nice and green. So I appreciate the work Davenport does to have that. And it would be nice if we could get some additional leaks on the no stickers required leaf and compost collection. But it's not a requirement. Just sometimes the weather hasn't always cooperated on that. But keep up the good work. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public? I then move to close the public hearing. Second. I have a second. All those in favor, please say aye. Any opposed? All right, I yield the floor back to you, mayor. Thank you, Alderwoman Newton. Next area is petitions, communications. Anyone? Alderman grip. Give me one sec. Sorry. All right. I wanted to mention that we have an opportunity to volunteer for riverfront cleanup. The coffee and cleanup event is happening Saturday, April 27 from 10:00 a.m. to noon. If you go to the city's facebook page, you can click the link and register there. Can QC fuel is going to be on site in Quinlan court through the duration of the event. You have to purchase the beverages, but the coffee will be there. Hopefully we get good weather. When there's good weather, we typically have a nice turnout and we clean up from the winter and make our riverfront look beautiful. Hope to see you there. Thank you, Alderman Grip. Alderwoman Newton. Thank you, mayor. I want to take a moment to update the public with the consent of our interim city administrator. Update the public? That the council has engaged in negotiations with our interim city administrator and we have reached a tentative agreement. Outside council is currently working on drafting a contract, and we hope that such would appear on next week's agenda, which would be published this Friday. So I would encourage the public to look for that. And hopefully we do get to that point to where we have a contract with our interim city administrator, Merritt, which was in fact, discuss with the entire council. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Newton. Alderwoman mcGuinness. Thank you, your honor. First of all, I want to thank Clay Merritt for a great award meeting on Monday. We talked about the update on the Canadian Pacific, the silent crossings across the Canadian Pacific line. Fascinating project. And every crossing is different because every road is different. And that's something that I hadn't thought about before, but just going through that process. And also we got an update on the new $13 million promise grant, which we'll work on again, the flood resiliency plan. So thank you so much for that. It was very interesting. I also wanted to mention that yesterday at our council update meeting, we had a presentation from the school administration about the plans at the Frank L. Smart site, the old smart Monroe site with the Frank L. Smart school site. And I am. I took the opportunity yesterday to ask and am working on with alderman Dunn and anybody else who's interested. I believe there's part of fourth ward that comes into that school as well. We're trying to put together a meeting. I'm hoping it'll be over at the old Frank Smart School for the community to sort of see the plans. They're interesting, exciting, and I'm sure there's a lot of interest in them.

So thank you so much for that. It was very interesting. I also wanted to mention that yesterday at our council update meeting, we had a presentation from the school administration about the plans at the Frank L. Smart site, the old smart Monroe site with the Frank L. Smart school site. And I am. I took the opportunity yesterday to ask and am working on with alderman Dunn and anybody else who's interested. I believe there's part of fourth ward that comes into that school as well. We're trying to put together a meeting. I'm hoping it'll be over at the old Frank Smart School for the community to sort of see the plans. They're interesting, exciting, and I'm sure there's a lot of interest in them. So hopefully we can get that scheduled for May. We will get it, you know, published broadly and widely. So I'm working on that right now to get that on the agenda so everybody can take time out to see. So that's all I have tonight, your honor. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman McGinnis. Alderman Kelly, thank you so much. I just have a few things. The fifth ward meeting will be the 25th at the church on the corner of grand and Kirkwood. I think it's harvest time at 530 every Thursday. Last Thursday of the month are the fifth ward meetings. So I don't want to be interrupting with everybody else, but I'm also letting everybody know I'm also having on May 28, we're going to have a memorial. Keep the conversation going for 324 Main street. It'll be a third Baptist church, 530. So on the year anniversary of the building collapse, I will be hosting a program for those folks that want to be in remembrance of the folks that lost their lives. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Alderman Kelly. Anyone else? And I just want to have a quick shout out to visiquad cities who's doing great work in tourism and is receiving a lot of awards. And their efforts recently, in the last few years, but especially recently, both in Illinois and Iowa, to bring folks here is to be commended. So I just wanted to quickly draw attention to that for the council. So, seeing no one else, we'll move to the four areas for discussion. Community development, public safety, public works, and finance. The first one's community development. Alderman Grip and Alderman Reinhertz will discuss. Alderman Grip, please. Thank you, your honor. We have two items on this evening's community development agenda. The first item is a resolution of approving the proposed conditional conveyance of city owned property located in the 700 block of East 6th street for the Riverview Heights Housing project to Riverview Heights, LLC. Is there anyone from the public here to comment on this item? Is there anyone from the council? Start with alderwoman McGinnis. Thank you so much, Alderman grip. Yes, I'm very excited to see this project come forward. And Mister Berger, if I could have you come up again, please. Thank you. So I know this is a long time coming. You talked a little bit about the challenges on that street. If you could just remind folks again of the. There was an agreement for six houses in 2013 and that did not go through, correct? Right, correct. And in 2013, 2013, we had an RFP that we issued to see if anyone wanted to develop, and we had no interest from that RFP. And then fast forward to 2017. We had an offer from a developer to do six single family. And I believe the financing challenge was to be able to get bank financing because of the upside down with the value of the properties once completed. Correct. And if you could, I think there was a question about a little bit of confusion about the back area that there is a. The brick, which is the width of an alley, but that is actually a street. Could you talk a little bit about that? Sure. So 6th street is, I think what most would view as kind of the main frontage, and that is a fairly well traveled road. 7th street is really. Is as narrow as an alley. In fact, it's narrower than some alleys, and it's in tough shape. It has a really big hill. And that would be, though, the major access point. So most of the developments that we've seen folks propose in that area see the driveways coming off of the alley off of 7th street. Sorry. It is the street currently, but as a protected brick street, you're not allowed. If you're repairing it, you have to repair it with brick, which can be a bit more. Quite a bit more expensive. And so that's the request that they've noted they'd like to pursue. That's a separate action through the historic Preservation commission and then the city council. So that decision yet to be discussed and made, but we're simply identifying that as a condition they put on the offer. And if you could explain, since you're up here, the processes this would have to go through then, before it comes back to council, for example, of the changing. The changing of the zoning for. The zoning change is one that is roughly a three and a half month process. It starts with an application through the plan zone commission, with a number of public hearings and review by staff. And then if it would move forward, it would come to you all with another public hearing and three readings in front of the city council that, I think, at the fastest, would probably conclude by end of the summer, if that went through. And if I might, I don't know if you were gonna ask one, but the sidewalk question as well was raised. The sidewalk is on the 7th street portion, which is really the alley portion. And I think some of the dilemma is that there isn't even right of way there to be able to do it. So, again, more complicated would go through when it comes through for city council discussion. Thank you so much. I could ask the developer please, to come forward. Again. Thank you. Thank you for being here tonight. Of course. Mary. Yes. If you could talk a little bit about. If you're.

If you're able to do that, a little bit about the. How. How long you've been in working on this. And to answer a question, you have a similar project, I think, in another city to make you talk about that. So could you talk a little bit about how long. This is Jim Thompson from 2604. He's 40th here in Davenport. I sat next to the architect who's since left, and he reminded me that I didn't mention that project in Moline. I built and developed 22 townhomes on 6th Avenue in Moline. And I'm also one of the managers of 400 river drive here in Davenport. When I first started looking at this property was, frankly, when, you know, I'm a Davenport guy. And when I started to build in Moline, I had a couple of councilmen at that time took me out to lunch and took me out to lunch and said, you know, we have a property that we'd like for you to look at. And that was. Well, it was pre pandemic, so that's probably five years ago. Five, six years ago. And, you know, the townhomes wouldn't work there. And I've enjoyed that project in Moline, and it's done very well, occupancy wise, etcetera, but it would have. It just didn't fit the neighborhood at all. And so we tried separating those. Boy, I bet I've spent way too much money on an architect to try to figure out something who did that. And it was my architect who failed at trying to put six houses there. So it's been. It seems like a long time, councilwoman, and it feels like a long time. And even though I'm 73 years old, it has been a long time getting this to work. And I don't know that there's any other thing that can really work on that site. One of the challenges, I believe, is it's hilly, but it's not straight hills. Correct? Correct. And that's one of the reasons you couldn't do townhomes, is you'd end up with separate townhomes because it comes down so rapidly. And of course, on the site, you really want to maximize that view of the river. The good lord's not making any more of those. So. And that helps you bring the right kind of tenants to the neighborhood, etcetera. And not only that is difficult, it's how quickly it does it. You know, if it were, you know, you could carve ground off, etcetera, but you wouldn't want to do it there because you'd be carving off that view that I just indicated. There was also a question about parking we heard in the public hearing. So could you talk about how you're dealing with parking there? Answer that question. And again, park. Well, there is parking on the street in front if you wanted that, but that's not very conducive to. That's not the right word. It's not going to work really well because of the height of it coming. So there's parking off of the brick road, 7th street in the back of the units, and there will be units or garages for each unit. Three bedrooms will have two car garages and, excuse me, the two bedrooms will have single car garages and the three bedrooms will have double car garages in the back. And we have plenty of room back there if we thought we needed more parking. One of the huge expenses here is going to be mowing that yard. I thank you. I have no other questions. Someone might, but I did have one other comment to make. But thank you so much for talking to us. I did want to point out too, that the map we saw, because, of course, I don't think aerial has been updated. So what you saw across the street from this plot was some empty lots. Well, those are now mostly full. I believe that that's not an updated aerial, because I don't think we have those yet. But we now have across the street single family homes. We have been working with Habitat for a couple of years. And so this was a, you know, this was a street when. When I first came on council, there were several homes being built by the city, I think through the urban homestead program. There were some homes built by habitat for humanity kind of at the end of this block, but a lot of empty spaces. So over the last couple of years, Habitat has built a number of homes there in collaboration with the city. And that's very exciting. So they are there. They are now there. People are moving in or have moved in. So we have a whole affordable, and it's affordable housing there on the other side of the street. So I'm excited about this because what was it? Was this almost an empty street or a street with lots of, you know, missing teeth, as you say. If you look along a street, you have lots that get overgrown. Now is becoming a neighborhood and I really feel like this. If approved, of course, it has to go through planning and zoning, but will help you complete that street. And I'm very excited about that. This is not an area that one would expect this to be happening. I know my, I love my word and. But we have lots of challenges. So there is also, to answer another question, there is a small park there already off Sylvan. So there, there is parking. There is a park available there as well already. Thank you very much.

I'm sorry it took so long. All right, Alderman Kelly. Thank you, Mister Thompson. If you would hang out afterwards. I won't with the whole, I'll just ask questions, me and you, if you don't mind. When the council's over. But I do have one question of, we're talking about the 7th street, and we're talking about traffic, all this stuff. We're talking about bricks, we're talking about restorative. Who's paying for that? Is it going to be a city thing or is it going to be on this? So if somebody could help me out with that, we'll have Bruce come and try to answer that question. Bruce Berger, community and economic development. Again, I'll try to answer the way that it's structured. The cost would be on the developer to do those, which is why I think they'd like to, to apply for the waiver, to be able to maybe do it in asphalt or concrete as opposed to brick. That's my understanding. Alderman Dunn. Alderman Rick Dunn. Thank you. I'm just curious, what's the waiver on the sidewalk? Is there a reason for that? Thank you. Developer maybe will answer this one better, too. But I think the city code would say if you're developing, if you're putting new housing on a street, that you would need to put in a sidewalk because it doesn't exist now. It's never had one. And so I think that would be, again, looking at the right of way and all those, and this is getting a little bit ahead of the game. I realize that's not a decision for tonight, but they just signal that that's something they'd like to pursue. If they get conditional site control, that might be something they ask for. So that since it's not very, it isn't used now, and it really functions. Not very much like a public street, but more like an alley. And you don't usually have sidewalks on the alley, that they would ask for a waiver from the city code to be able to do that. They may be able to speak more to what the plans are, if they'd like to, but that's my understanding. Alderman Reinertz. Thank you. I got one more question. Is 7th street wide enough to be a street and have a sidewalk, or is that part of the reason why we're looking at a sidewalk waiver? I'm really. I'm probably not the one qualified to be able to answer that for you. I know it's very narrow. All right, thank you. Older woman lynch. Thank you. I'm so sorry. You might not know this answer, but since you're already halfway here, is there a sidewalk to the south of that, on the other side of the street? Okay, thank you. If you were asking if it's on 6th street, yes, there's a sidewalk on six. There's no sidewalk on 7th, so I don't see anyone else. I don't have any questions for you, Director Berger. So I was very, very happy to see this come back to us. As I said a week or two ago, this is a project that has come back in many different forms over the last decade. I've seen several ward aldermen tried to work with different developers to get this done. We've looked at tiny homes there, we've looked at container homes there. We've looked at multifamily. We've looked at single family. It is a very challenging topography, is what I think makes it so challenging. And think about where this is. It's on East 6th street. It sits adjacent to Antoine Leclerc's house. So this is a very old portion of Davenport. So if you listen to what was said, we're going to have a zoning change. If we approve this, we'll have a zoning change come before us. We'll have a potentially have a brick street waiver that would come before us and then a sidewalk waiver. So my recommendation to the council is, if we approve this, is go walk that site and see what we mean with the topography and also see what we mean with what 7th street is. Because when I was told 7th street was a street, I was shocked because it looks and feels like an alley. But. So I'm hoping that this will be approved and will give the developer an opportunity to make a really great development because I don't want to bury the lead here. $4.8 million development in the central city of Davenport. That's pretty incredible. That's awesome. We've been working at this for a long time, and Alderwoman McGinnis is right. You can't tell the story of this particular property without looking at all of the development on East 6th street. Single family owner occupied. Working people who now own homes in our city and are paying taxes. It's pretty incredible. Recommend anyone in the public go look what's happened there. It's been great. This is the next step in that, and I'm very hopeful that the developer is going to be able to get this done. Seeing no one else, we're going to move to item number two, which is a resolution approving case f 240. Four being the request of McCoy homes for a final plat of Sang Meadows, second edition.

A 33 lot subdivision on 10.97 acres located west of Northwest Boulevard and south of Willow Circle. Is there anyone from the public here to comment on this item? State your name and address or ward. Gary Ekman. I live in Alderman McKelley's ward and I want a half heartedly, I'm going to say, speak against this because I know it's going to be approved and I wish the developer luck. But I believe that this is a bad idea because we have so many empty lots, we've had so many houses destroyed, we have so many spaces where houses could be put in and we have an extinction crisis. And Davenport is a leader in provoking that. The monarch butterfly is at its second lowest level ever and the lowest level was only a year or two ago. People who, like the monarch butterflies, can be prepared to only see them in little monarch zoos because they're going to go extinct. And the destruction of their habitat, as well as poison, is in large measure responsible for that. And this was not long ago, agricultural land. I mentioned before that in my lifetime and everybody's lifetime on the city council, almost the entire population of the same size that it is right now was south of Kimberly and north of Kimberley. There was green space and agricultural land and a lot more habitat for salamanders. If there's any salamanders left in Scott County, I don't know, but we're paving over all of this stuff. And as I've mentioned before, more roads, more sewers, more costs, more city staff, more city trucks. So we're looking at new sewers, new roads, new sidewalks, more city staff to drive the snowplows. And someone recently asked on the other one about who's paying for all this. I don't know who pays for the roads and sewers. I've always thought the city does. I mean, I know they pay for them once they're there, but I would be curious for this development as they put in new roads, for these plots, as they put in the new roads and the new sewers. Is the city paying for that or is the developer paying for that? Because in my opinion, especially in something like this, where you're paving over green space, the developer should pay 100% of this new sewer cost, 100% of the road costs, not the existing, not the existing population. All of the development seems to be put on the backs of overly put on the backs. I know wealthy people pay taxes, but wealthy people's houses are more accurately assessed at their value, whereas lower income people's houses are over accessed. So they pay more than their fair share of taxes. So. And I am going to sit down here and like I say, I'm sure the development is going to go through. And I don't mean anything against the developer. I'm sure they're perfectly nice people. And these will be perfectly nice houses for people who are wealthy enough to buy them. Which of course, doesn't include me. Before I do sit down, though, I did want to note that a moment ago when I made reference to accurate reference to racial comments by city staff. People in the audience kind of seem to boo me. And no one from the city podium. Mister who gets upset, we're gonna stick to, right? I just wanna say. I just wanna say. No, no, no, don't continue with your line of thought. Come back to your thoughts on this particular development. Well, my thoughts on making some. My thoughts on this development. Thank you. My thoughts on this development, on anything else, is that a person at the podium should have the right to speak. Thank you. That's all. And thank you. Like I say, I'm sure the developer's a nice guy. And I'm not saying anything bad about him, so I want that understood. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public? Step to the lectern. State your name and address or Ward. You have five minutes. Hi, my name is Benjamin Baher. I work at Townsend Engineering and I represent the developer. He built the first edition. I think he has one or two lots that are still not sold and he wants to continue with more single family for the city of Davenport. To answer Mister Eckhart's questions, the developer, Jason McCoy, is paying for the roadways, the sewer, the sidewalk, the sanitary, and all the infrastructure. And then those will be dedicated to the city as per his normal for subdivisions. If there's any questions for the developer or the engineering team, I'm happy to answer them. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public here to comment on this item? Seeing no one will move to council comments. Seeing no comments from the council, I would ask alderman Reinerts to set our agenda.

So I'm asking you all to give the same recommendations to all bars and not just a few. Thank you. Thank you very much. Seeing no one else, is there any council comment on any of the other items. Otherwise, I will ask for any public with comment on the 11th street precinct. 2108 East 11th street outdoor area license type class C liquor with the fire department recommended denial. Please step to the podium. Name order? Address, please. My name is Doug Wells. I'm an attorney at 23 22 East Kimberly Road, Davenport. I represent Weiser Properties, LLC who is the owner of 11th Street Precinct bar and grill. So a few years ago, our client expanded its restaurant and bar by adding an open air outdoor beer garden. The beer garden consisted of a large open room that has concrete floors, brick, stone and mortar walls that are probably 12ft tall or higher. Most of you have probably seen it if you've been to the village, but that's kind of what we're looking at there. There's another picture here on the two street sides of the building. It has large open windows on all sides. It also has a large open doorway on each of the two street sides of the building, as well as doorways back into the main restaurant. The ceiling, if you can call it a ceiling, is made of slats of metal that are attached to a motor so that they can open, louver, open or shut, just like a blind louver, open or shut with just the push of a button that can do that. The roof has no insulation, and even when the louvers are shut, the water can still come through if it's raining. So it's not really a waterproof facility. It's not really what we would call an enclosed area. But the area has become the most popular part, or one of the most popular parts of the restaurant. In the fall of 2022, in an attempt to extend the beer garden season, our client had removable plexiglass inserts manufactured to partially block the window openings, and these were mainly meant for wind blocks. The city inspectors came in and objected to the installation of these inserts unless a sprinkler system was also installed in the area, which I can tell you right now, we could talk to the sprinkler people. They say sprinkler system wouldn't work, work in this area, so it'd be a humongous waste of money to put one in there. And I guess that's where our story begins. After the city inspectors came in and objected to the Plexiglas wind blocks, our client filed an administrative appeal of the city inspector's interpretation, and on December 13 of 2022, there was a hearing before the city's combined construction board of appeals. Now, I wasn't representing our client at the time, and Mister John Wiser, who is the principal for Weiser Properties LLC, could not attend because he was out of the country. He requested a continuance for that hearing, and that was denied. The board voted at that hearing. The construction appeal board voted at that hearing to deny his appeal. Now, on the same day of that vote, December 13, 2022, city Legal sent an application to the state alcohol beverage division, or ABD, requesting a suspension of our clients outdoor service area liquor license. Three days later, the ABD summarily denied the city legal application, noting that because the city's municipal code provides remedies for the violations alleged, the ABD would not get involved in a contested fire code dispute. The ABD specifically noted to the city legals that the city ordinances provide for the city to cite our client for a simple misdemeanor to issue a municipal infraction, or thirdly, to seek injunctive relief, or perhaps all three. However, in the year and a half since that denial came down, the city has not attempted to do any of those remedies. Moreover, and perhaps more important, the city ordinance establishing the Board of Appeals states, amongst other things, that the board shall render all decisions and findings in writing to the building official with a duplicate copy to the appeal. Despite repeated requests by me to both city legal and to this board of appeals itself, there's never been, to the best of our knowledge, any written findings that we're aware of. The importance of this is that we believe that the city inspector's interpretation of the building and fire codes is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. We also believe it's contrary to the international building code, but we can only appeal to a court to have those decisions decided if we can get. Thank you, sir. Yeah, one action or the other. Thank you very much. I'd be happy to talk to any via privately. Anyone else from public wishing to comment on the side, please step to the podium. Name, order, address, please. John Wiser, the honor of 11th street precinct. Now, as Doug said, he gave you the history of what happened. Some of you know what. Also, this year we put the panels back up, but we made some concessions. You have pictures, prints in front of you. Well, last year, when the fire marshal inspected, we had covers over the doorways, too. We took those down. Now, it currently looks like this. I think a reasonable person would agree that it doesn't feel like an enclosed area. There's nothing over there. Those gaps, those doorways are 4ft by 11ft. And there's two of them. And there's also breathing space underneath all of the panels. The window panels, these panels, a version of these panels was approved from the very beginning. This wasn't something that I just thought of after we built this. From the very beginning, I had intended to have some kind of panel to block the wind around this patio. And I proposed a solution to Trish Napradna, and she went all the way to the state fire marshal and she got approval from him. And he cited codes stating that a patio, an outdoor area made of non combustible material, would be exempt from a sprinkler system. This is from the state fire marshal. So I think the local officials are going a little bit overboard in the way they're interpreting this code.

I tried this last time and I couldn't get one alderman to visit. I'd like to show you really what it's like, let you see for yourself and try to determine what's reasonable and what's not. This. I mean, when, you know, they put a lot of effort into building in the village of East Davenport and it doesn't really give you a good feeling when you have to fight on every little item, it doesn't really make you want to invest further in Davenport. All I've heard tonight is further investment. You guys like that? Well, everyone likes that, but this kind of treatment is ridiculous. So if you guys want to come down and look at this, look at this in person, talk to me directly. I can tell you why the state fire marshal doesn't agree with the sprinkler system. Physics does not allow a sprinkler system to work in an outdoor environment. That sprinkler head needs to be heated to 160 degrees to activate. If it's in an outdoor environment like this patio 11ft in the air, nothing will ever activate that sprinkler head. There's nothing to burn 11ft in the air. With a vented roof and vented sides, where's the heat going to be trapped? What's going to activate it? Your fire marshal's wrong. You should go with the state fire marshal's ideas. Thank you. Thank you very much. Anyone else from public wishing to comment on this item? Before going to council, I would ask our fire Marshal Morris, if you could please come up, provide a little context as to history on this item. Good evening. Jim Morris, fire marshal. I'm going to give you a brief presentation here on the 11th street. So for a little bit of a background timeline, June 2020 plans were received for both an addition and a patio space. That addition is right here. There's a two hour firewall that separates this area here. That it was done in order to not require the sprinkler system because of the original bar that was in place, the enclosed area at the time did not exceed the occupant load of 99, which is the threshold for a sprinkler system. So it was not required. This was the plans that were initially submitted. Determination was based on the plans that did not show the patio. This is the view of the patio canopy structure edition was submitted for review after a stop work order was issued. Because it was never. It was never submitted for plan review initially. When the addition was submitted, the enclosure panels were not included in the submitted plans. The chief building official sent an email stating that the structure cannot be enclosed by means of vinyl or other material in the future. November of 2022, frame plex glass panels are installed within the outdoor patio. You can see the louver system that he's talking about here for the roof. And then the panels are in place. They encompass this whole opening here on each of these windows. I then sent a letter notifying the property owner of the code violation and instruct him to either install the sprinkler system or remove the panels. That time, the property owner decided he wanted to appeal my interpretation of the code to the Combined Code Board of Appeals on December 2022. Combined code of Board of Appeals hears the appeal. On December 13, they rule in favor of the city. The combined code Board of Appeal decision is final unless it's appealed to the court system, which it was not done in this case, the property owner removed the panels for a period of time, and then come fall of 2023 and spring of 2024, we noticed that the panels. I received comments from city workers that it looked like the panels were back in place and installed. Also, the business advertised it has winterized its patio, and the winter panels are in place on September 2023. And as of today, this month, the panel still remain in place as of April 2024. I'm going to go back to the layout here. So with this, when this is submitted here, the code review analysis by the architects shows that this has an occupant load of 58 people. In this area here, there are two wide open bi fold doors that can be opened and closed, which makes this area one big fire area. This occupant load is 97 by the square footage total is 155, which is above the 99 threshold, which would require a sprinkler. I'll answer any questions that you have about this. Colleagues, just have one question. Have you and the business owner had any conversations about alternative ways to modify the plexiglass, and is there any way to modify it to make it compliant? So the original discussion that was had was he initially wanted to put screens up. The chief building official reached out to the state fire marshal's office and spoke to one of the plan's examiners. They said that it would not be an issue if he provided screens that only came down to the top of the pier, screens, not plexiglass, and they were allowed. He did not want to do that, and in turn, went on his own and installed the panels, the plexiglass panels, in the fr", "answer_v2": "[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Business Entity (vendor operating the patio)\",\n    \"positives\": [],\n    \"negatives\": [\n      \"Violation of local fire codes by using unapproved plexiglass panels on the patio.\",\n      \"Non-compliance with the city's order regarding modifications.\",\n      \"Enclosed area exceeds the occupant load threshold requiring a sprinkler system.\"\n    ],\n    \"decision\": \"sell\",\n    \"comment\": \"The business has repeatedly violated local fire codes and regulations, despite warnings and directives from local authorities.

That's the only question I had. I see Alderman Reinert's. Thank you. So, if I'm hearing correctly, the primary reason for the sprinkler requirement is because there are other doors that allow it to open up into a much larger area. Correct. And the plexiglass has to remain, is. That's basically what you've been told. I'm sorry. The plexiglass is going to remain. They're not willing to take it down? Not as at this point, no, they're not. All right, fine. Thank you. I see Alderman Rick. Done. Thank you. So basically, you're telling us this does not meet our fire code, correct. It does not. The removal of the plexiglass will make everything code compliant. Okay. And we've tried to get this establishment in compliance before, and we're having. We're not getting there. No. Okay. So currently we are not in compliance. That is correct. All I need. Thank you, Alderman McGinnis. And I don't mean to beat this to death, but the only way this space could be compliant, the way it's constructed now, is with no plexiglass. Correct. Okay. No plexiglass. He can install screens, if you would like that come down to the top of the pier. Right. But not plexiglass. No plexiglass. Twelve months out of the year. Correct. And I will also tell you, too, that during the install, there's in floor heat that was put in there. There is eight electric radiant heaters that are in there, and led lighting also. So this is set up to be a very comfortable spot. And I don't have any reason to not want him to do this. Minus the fact that it's a life safety issue and in violation of the fire code, if we remove the plexiblast, it can be business as usual. Thank you. Seeing no one else, I have just one question. You mentioned the combined code board of appeals. Who makes up that board? So that's made up of design professionals, architects. There are various well respected, licensed contractors throughout the city that make up that board. So that's people within the city. It's not something in Des Moines. No, it's within this. There are local contractors, not city staff, not city employees. They're local contractors and architects that make up that board. Okay. Thank you. That's the only question I have at this time. Second go around. Right. So is this. Since this isn't I mean, the way it's constructed right now with the panels. Is it? It is. And we're talking about his denial of his west outdoor service area. And we're talking about a liquor license. But it is not safe to be there. I mean, in other words, is it? If you were going to anybody else and you were looking at any other take this establishment away and had this situation, would it be able to be used by our code? We're talking about a liquor license here. I'm asking if we. If you were inspecting a building. Forget about the liquor license. You were inspecting a building. You came in and you saw this. No, that new addition would not allow occupancy. Would you allow occupancy or not? No. Okay. No occupancy. I would not allow occupancy in the new edition or the patent. Okay. All right. Thank you. Seeing no one else, I would just recommend that this item be placed on discussion. And with that, I would ask Alderman Tim Dunn to please set our agenda. No, sir. We can talk to you afterwards or you'll have an opportunity next week because this will be item on the discussion. Sorry, sir, it's not our. Not our rules and our procedure. Mister Weiser, please sit down. Mister Wiser, please sit down. All right. I'd like to make a motion to put all the items of public safety to the consent agenda. Except for ward five, involving the 11th street precinct. I have a motion. A second. All in favor? All opposed? Same sign closes public safety. Back to you, Mister mayor. Thank you. Alderman Jobshin and Alderman Tim Dunn. The next series, Public works alderman Rick Dunn and Alderman Kelly will discuss. Alderman Rick Dunn, please. Thank you, your honor.

Thank you, your honor. Tonight, elderwoman lynch and I have three items on the finance agenda. The first item is a resolution amending the FY 2024 operating and capital improvement budgets. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item before going to council? I just. I do want to take a cherished privilege and ask if someone from staff can answer the question that was asked earlier during the public hearing in regards to why we're amending the budget. Why that's done, please. Thank you. Of course, by state code, budgets are required to be amended to ensure that your expenditures are in line with the budget amounts based on specific categories that are set out by the state. That's also within the packet. So the categories that we look at for this are a little bit different than what you see in your normal, routine budget documents. So you can go online and see all of those. And again, this is on a timeline, so you're not able to exceed a category under state code without first amending the budget. And so we're up a little bit against that timeline, and that is the purpose. It's a routine process that we do each year, typically in April or May. Thank you, interim administrator. Is there anyone from council wishing to address this item? Seeing none. Moving on to item number two, resolution adopting the FY 2025 operating budget, FY 2025 capital improvement budget, and the FY 2025 through FY 2030 capital improvement plan. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this? Is there anyone from council. Alderman Rick Dunn, please. Thank you. I would request that we monitor the disbursement of funding for the Quad city chamber until the city has voting representation on the newly formed economic development Board or is giving voting rights. There's some other way. Thank you. Anyone else? No? Okay. You, mayor. Mayor. Thank you, madam chair, for allowing me to speak. I just want to thank the staff, the finance chair and vice chair, and the city council for your work on the respective work sessions that we had on the budget. All the effort that you put in from the timeline that Miss Merritt put, it's a pretty intense efforts. And I just want to applaud the collaboration between the city council, the members here, and the staff on getting to where we are and getting this balanced budget with a reduced property tax.

Anyone else from council seeing none, moving on to the final item number three, motion awarding a professional services contract for the city administrator and corporation Council recruitments to Colin Baningzer and associates of Daytona Beach Shores, Florida, in the amount not to exceed $70,000, and authorizing the mayor to execute any related agreements.

I first would like to take the chair's privilege and ask the chair of the search committee, Mister Mo Heider, to please come up and present an update on this matter. Thank you, Alderwoman Newton. And good evening, Mayor Matson and council members. I'm Mo Heiner. I'm the regional vice president for Elite Casino Resorts, which is the parent company for Rhythm City Casino. As the chair elect for the mayor's selection committee, thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide an update on the selection process for the city administrator. As you know, the selection committee was appointed by the mayor Matson and is comprised of seven business community leaders and four older persons from this council. And this diverse group has worked very diligently to assess each RFP respondent and help the selection process. So I would like to take this opportunity and recognize that of all the persons of the council. So Mister Kyle Grip, who also serves as the secretary for the selection committee, Miss Mary McGinnis, Miss Michu lynch and of course Mister Dunn. Thank you very much and I appreciate your leadership. We are also grateful to the city's director team of Miss Fleming and Miss Merritt and their staff for their exceptional service and support that they provided to the selection committee. Their dedication and professionalism has been instrumental in guiding us through this very important process. We used a very rigorous ranking process and this committee reviewed proposals from eight different respondents. We assessed each proposal based on qualifications, experience and alignment with the city's needs and goals. The process led us to narrow down the respondents to three final candidates. The three candidates were then interviewed by the committee on April 3, and the interviewees were evaluated not only for their leadership style, but their strategic approach and their understanding of the future needs of the city. And after careful consideration, the majority selected Colin Bainziger and associates. Colin Bainziger and associate demonstrated a deep understanding of our community's needs and goals, their experience in local government management. Some of them have actually have served in different capacities in governmental management and the strategic planning and commitment to transparency and accountability which was important to us, made them the most suitable candidate. Mister Bainzinger is the principal of the firm and as the owner, he himself has committed to lead the search. So on behalf of the selection committee, I respectfully request the approval of Colin Basinger and associates. We believe that their expertise and resources will enable us to effectively manage the hiring process and meet our target of filling the possession by September 1. Additionally, your approval will allow us to work closely in the upcoming weeks to create a comprehensive position profile and initiate a targeted marketing campaign. We are confident that this partnership will result in the successful recruitment of a highly qualified candidate. So I want to thank you for your support and consideration for this request. And I'm happy to answer any questions. All right, we'll call you back up if there's any questions. We'll first hear from the public. Thank you. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this matter? Please step forward. State your name and either ward or address, please. Katie Devon work. My question and concern isn't so much with most of it, other than the bottom part where it says authorizing the mayor to execute any related arguments I guess I don't understand what decisions he has to make by himself when this is supposed to be voted on by the council. So it really seems like an undermined trying to take the power from you guys into one. So I don't know if someone can clarify exactly what that means in regards to authorizing the mayor to execute any related agreements. It kind of also makes it sound like get somebody that he approves versus somebody that's actually really good for the studies that you guys, all of you should be voting on. So that's my concern. If there's anyone else from the public, please stand for. Come up and state your name, address or Ward. Gary Eklin. I live in Davenport. I live in Alderman Kelly's ward. And I. This is the first chance that I remember getting the chance to speak on the search committee. And I want to say I actually thought the Mister Moe Hyder was a woman. I remember there used to be a woman named mo around here and I actually thought it was a woman. So I all respect to Mister Moe Hyder, but I object to the makeup of the search committee itself. And I don't think it represents the community. And I realize I want to say all respect to the two new women. I'm not. I'm not trying to single people. The agenda item is specifically the search committee. I object. The search committee. It's whether or not to award the contract to this company and this company. I'm opposed to any and all actions by the search committee. Sometimes I'm boxed in because there's an issue here that relates to the search.

If there's anyone else from the public, please stand for. Come up and state your name, address or Ward. Gary Eklin. I live in Davenport. I live in Alderman Kelly's ward. And I. This is the first chance that I remember getting the chance to speak on the search committee. And I want to say I actually thought the Mister Moe Hyder was a woman. I remember there used to be a woman named mo around here and I actually thought it was a woman. So I all respect to Mister Moe Hyder, but I object to the makeup of the search committee itself. And I don't think it represents the community. And I realize I want to say all respect to the two new women. I'm not. I'm not trying to single people.

I'm opposed to any and all actions by the search committee. Sometimes I'm boxed in because there's an issue here that relates to the search. But somehow I'm afraid you're not going to let me address. And that is who's making the decisions and what parameters are being done here. I know that the person is going to come back and at some point they're going to say they want $260,000 a year. And I'm thinking for the search committee that the search committee should have perimeters of what's acceptable. And I would propose that the search committee be given a directive that the maximum salary for this job is $100,000 a year. Because that's enough. And part of the problem, Mister Eckland, the topic, the agenda item is simply whether or not the council awards the contract to this company for them to go out and look for different candidates. It's not appointing a candidate or anything like that that would be handled by this council. So this is specifically on this matter is whether or not your comment should be on the contract itself and whether or not the council should award it to this company to conduct the search. And I don't think that it should award it. I don't think that. With all respect to Mister Heider, I don't think Mister Heider should be on the committee. The gambling industry benefited from an identity theft on a Mister Eklund. This is not on. This is not on top. Yeah, I'm going to be. Point of order. But the Eckland. The mayor should be removed. And a new mayor should appoint the council. Oh, I was next. My bad. Thank you. Just canals. Second word. I'm not denying that this should be approved. However, I am not for the fact of authorizing the mayor to execute any related agreements. We see where some of his agreements landed us. My thing is, is this is supposed to be a strong council, weak mayor. And the fact that I was at work today and I kind of just got really an upsetting vibe off of this. Because at the end of the day, this is just disgusting. Thank you. Anyone else please step forward. State your name, Ward, or address. I'm Lashona Dixon. I live in the senate wardrobe. I have to acknowledge some of Gary's concerns where we're concerned about who is on the committee. And I have to say that it's troubling. But the real point is this. And I think you assured us, Audorwood Newton, that you guys will be working together on choosing who is going to be our new city administrator. And I think we. I can learn to trust you with that. That decision is going to be made together, so I trust you with that. However, authorizing the mayor to execute any related agreements, that's kind of tough for us. You know, I feel like y'all should be making these decisions together. It just makes it really hard for us. Because some people I wouldn't trust if they were sitting on a stack of bibles. Thank you. Anyone else, please step forward. State your name, Ward, or address. Shel Shagna, third. Ward and I did some research on hiring firms and the going rate for the commission to bring in and to interview someone is anywhere from 15% to 25%. The 70,000 would be on the higher percentage of the 25%, but it is also of that percentage is based on the starting pay for the first year of the person they bring in. It's always been determined that our city administrator in the past was overpaid based on other cities of the same population, that our administrator received higher pay rate than other cities with the same demographics. So the $70,000 I have an issue with, because I feel like that's on a high side. And when you give people money that's not theirs to spend, they tend to go to the high side. It's just a human nature thing. If it's your money and you're reaching in your pocket, you're going to go on the lower side. So I'd like you to all think about it as your money, and you're going into your pocket and you want to go on to the lower side of that. So I do have an issue with the $70,000 not to exceed.

And I have to agree with the other speakers that have gotten up here. I think we would be absolutely knocking foots to allow the mayor to execute anything at this point. Point. Thank you. Anyone else, please state your name, Ward, or address. Lacona Dixon, 7th Ward. I agree with all the other people who have spoken, and I just want to come up here and make sure that, you know, my opinion is that I feel like that our mayor should not be able to do that on his own and that the people, the city council, should definitely have an input on how much money is spent to handle this situation. And I also want to voice as well is I think that the committee is the committee, but I think that it should be a little more mixed because some of the same people that had hand in one business is now in handy with the other business.

What called football players, and we had the geeks. And I feel like the cliques need to be broken up and we need to have some new, some old, some young, some black, some color and all that. Let's pick a correct person, as we have a wide diversity in this city. Thank you. Is there anyone else, before I go to, if there's anyone from council, can someone from staff please explain what that second part where it says authorizing the mayor to execute any related agreements? What agreements would be related in regards to this motion, please? Sure. I can take that. Madam chair, this is fairly common language, because when we have a contract that the council has awarded, there is typically a single signer on behalf of the city. And so this would likely be the contract or any type of authorization that was needed that would be signed, and then this item would be the council providing the mayor with the authorization to be the city signer, specifically only to the contract for hiring the firm. Correct? Correct. Or anything that's within the contract that would be awarded. Okay. All right. Thank you. Is there anyone from council wishing to address this? I will go with Alderman grip. I did want to point out two things regarding the price. The first is that the price does include the recruitment of both the city administrator and the corporation council. And that also the search committee. Pricing was a part of how each of these firms was ranked. It accounted for 10% of their ranking and it was in line with what the other firms were offering. Thank you. Thank you, Alderwoman McGinnis. Please. Thank you so much, Alderman Newton. So I just also wanted to add to this process. This is just the beginning of the process. And assuming that my colleagues do support this or vote yes for this, again, this is, as Alderman Gripp said, this is for two positions. There were a number of people who, a number of groups that came that we had to rank. We ranked them privately. We didn't talk about our rankings. That's not how the process works. It was rated. There was strong consensus of the top firms. And then, again, that's with ranking done absolutely independently of each other. So we came and it was interesting to see that. And then we did have a chance to talk to them. This is just the beginning. There will, there will be public involvement in this process. This is the, it is the process that our ordinance tells us we have to follow for a full, a permanent city administrator. And so there will be public involved in this coming down the road. That will, there will be a schedule. And so, and this committee will continue to work. I will say that it is, again, a committee, not just of older people, but of others in the community. And it is a varied committee, and I'm happy about that as well. So stay tuned. You will be hearing, everyone will be hearing a lot more about this process as we go forward. And hopefully this will. And we have been, everyone we talked to, all the three firms that we interviewed, all committed to a timely process as well, which is, and they have that. They have that experience and they have that ability to do that. So I feel like this was a very good choice. And I think everybody who worked on the committee, the people from the public who took the time, as well as the older people, because it, it took some work to get this far, but there's more work to go, and it will be, you'll be hearing more about it. Thank you. Thank you, Alderwoman lynch. Thank you. I am. I'm on the search committee. I just want to share how vigorous the task was. As Mister Heider pointed out, we took an afternoon on a weekday and we interviewed all three top candidates for an hour. And we did ask the very, very hard questions. Diversity was certainly something that was a factor in our decision making. We asked statistical questions, how many placements and how many of them were of diversity. So that was certainly something we were. We were taking into consideration. I actually, I personally think that this firm that we chose with as Alderman Grip said, 35,000. I think it's 35,000 per per hire was on the lower end of some of the other bids that we received. Some of them were in the hundreds of thousands. So I thought that was pretty shocking for me. So I was very pleased with the price point. I think all three firms were equally qualified as far as from a resume standpoint. But I will say that I think a large deciding factor was we had it boiled down to two of our top candidates, and one of them has placed other administrators or government folks in positions in the state of Iowa. And we decided that we probably should try to stay as far away as possible from a firm that has already had ties to working with local government in Iowa. So we ultimately ended up choosing the firm that has never had any ties or affiliation with the state of Iowa and is very far away. So thank you. Thank you.

We should have brought food. We should have brought snacks. That's kind of what we do. Good afternoon. For those of you that I don't know, I'm Dave Harrell, and I'm the president and CEO of Visiquad Cities, which is is the region's destination marketing and management organization. Hello, Kelly. How are you? Good to see you. With me. I'm not going to introduce them, but why don't you just introduce yourselves and just your title and what you do really quick, and then we can kind of get into this. Brittany Waltz, destination experience manager. I oversee our destination centers here in Davenport and Mulling. Joan Kranovich. I'm vice president of business growth and director of our sports queue initiatives. So I oversee our sales department as well as all the sports initiatives with our sports commission. I'm Katrina Kuening. I'm the director of branding content strategy, and I oversee our marketing. Welcome. So thank you all for the opportunity to be with you. Nobody pay any attention to the rendering, which is not a Davenport park, but just to connect with you really quick first, just want to thank the commission for everything that you do. The partnership that you've got with Visiquad cities means a great deal to us. We're grateful for it. Brittany, who mentioned Union Station? That's a really critical asset for us in terms of, like, visitor experience and activation. All the things that we try to do from a visitor perspective. It's been great for us to be at union or continuing to invest down there and scale that, just to make it something that I think we can all be proud of. One of the things that we had been talking to Courtney and the team for a number of months was certainly with the river cruise industry, which is vital to our business, as well as Davenport in the region, we felt like it was time to maybe punch up a little bit of that first impression and some signage and then around River Heritage park. And so one of the things that we started exploring was possibility of some signage. And I don't want to call it permanent signage because the signage that you see before you is modular, meaning it can be picked up and moved very easily. But our objective would be for this to be a sign that would remain in River Heritage park. It's really sort of that opportunity for our river cruise industry guests, when they get off those ships, to have a photo op chance. We've done some things, more temporary signage that we kind of bring in and out, but we feel like this is kind of a next level and an enhancement. When you look at the picture again, don't necessarily pay any attention to maybe the rendering, the actual dimensions. It's about 4ft high, so not terribly tall, and 20 by nine in length. It's aluminum based, it's weatherproof, it's a very durable product. And the vendor that we're working with does this all throughout the midwest. So a lot of destinations and similar organizations to ours work with this particular partner and they do a variety of things. We're sort of on contract with them to hopefully put this sign into play at the park at our expense. This is something that we would love for the commission to support. We will obviously work very closely with Chad Dyson, with public works, with the commission, Courtney and her team to identify the ideal location. And we do plan on scaling.

It's aluminum based, it's weatherproof, it's a very durable product. And the vendor that we're working with does this all throughout the midwest. So a lot of destinations and similar organizations to ours work with this particular partner and they do a variety of things. We're sort of on contract with them to hopefully put this sign into play at the park at our expense. This is something that we would love for the commission to support. We will obviously work very closely with Chad Dyson, with public works, with the commission, Courtney and her team to identify the ideal location. And we do plan on scaling. This amount is yet to be determined, but we have had conversations with our other municipal partners and plan to have some of these in and around the quad cities. So this won't be the only place where people will have these photo opportunities that I think are so vital to social media and the things that we're trying to do to brand and market and promote and engage our visitors, but then also residents, too, just kind of elevates a little bit of the brand and makes it pop. We don't really have timing yet established because we wanted to obviously meet with you and kind of get your approval. It doesn't take too terribly long to manufacture these signs. Once you give the vendor the go ahead, the only dynamic in terms of timing is because they do a lot of these throughout the midwest. As you can imagine, working with organizations like us, sometimes you can kind of be maybe at the bottom of the tick list in terms of the thing. So our objective is to have something in play by the time the river cruise season starts. We do anticipate another robust year. We'll have less dockings this year, as you all know about american queen and their bankruptcy situation, and a little bit of modifications to the american cruise line schedule. But we're anticipating about 5000 plus some odd guests that will come in to the park during the 2024 season. And that's always going to ebb and flow. But we just think this is a really nice visual for people to engage and kind of get those photo ops. We'll maintain it. Certainly our staff will, you know, sort of. We're not going to be over there every day, but we'll make sure that we check on any asset that we have, whether it's, you know, things in and around Union Station, Moline, other places that we've got a presence. So we'll make sure that we're maintaining it. The only thing that we would probably ask the city is, boy, if the parks department is in there and they see it and it looks a little dirty and they can maybe clean it up for a couple minutes, that would be great, too. So I think it's something that we would love to have that understanding again. They're modular. They can be moved. We also know that there's trolls out there that might do a little graffiti and some of those things, and we'll just all have to be prepared for that. The cost on these are about $12,000 to be able to manufacture. Again. We're going to take that expense on. That doesn't include any installation costs or any of those kind of things with our vendor, but that's just kind of the hard cost. On this particular signage dimension, there are things that are larger and smaller, and we looked at all those options, but certainly for us, if we're going to scale some of these around the region, we want to be mindful of those expenses and feel like this is the right size. That 4ft by 20ft by nine is also good. I think from a public safety perspective, it's not going to be something so tall where you might have some people crawl up there and they might be able to get hurt. It's pretty low in the ground, I think. Fun for kids to maybe poke their head through the queue and the sea and those kinds of. So I'd love to answer any questions. We wanted to bring our folks that are involved with this stuff every day. That way they're the experts in the room who are smarter than me and would love to answer your questions. Bill, is it going to be lighted? No. No, sir. No, but it won't be lit. But the color palette, obviously, if the moon is shining, et cetera, you're going to see elimination. But it's not a backlit sign. There's no led component. It's essentially made out of aluminum, but the color palette will make it pop. How is it secured? You know, that's a great question. There's a base to it. You'll see where we've got the visiquadcities.com, which is important just to try to engage people online. There is a foundational base, whether it's going to be placed in grass or concrete. That's really something we'll leave to the experts at public works and Chad and his team to determine what's the right place at River Heritage park. That way it is secured and it's not something that can be easily pushed over. Yes, it definitely will be one. Do you see it being there year round or just current? Yeah, we do. Yeah, we think it's a year round thing. Again, there's a lot of destination organizations that have similar types of signage, bill, in and around and also around the country and the world, too. But Rockford has some stuff and their downtown park that's pretty visible, very similar in size and dimension. And it's a year round asset for people to enjoy, whether it's ten below or 80 and sunny. That's a great idea. You said maybe working with other kind of areas that have a lot of visitors. Have any of those been put into place? Yeah. So we do plan on scaling conversations in around the I 74 bridge, for obvious reasons in terms of what that looks like. Rock Island, East Moline. So I think our objective would probably be some placement within the five larger metros. The funny, not funny thing. But the interesting thing was with our team thinking about placement, there's also a fantastic spot at Lindsay park, too. That might be a really cool visual. So you're in an elevated space, you're in the park hanging out, and then when you're taking that selfie, you're going to get just a fabulous view.

Rock Island Arsenal. And so that might be an opportunity, too, but I think we wanted to start here just for obvious reasons, because of the amount of people and that density coming off the river cruises, knowing that we're gonna have at least 5000 coming off those boats, to just have that first impression, which way do you see it facing? That's a great question. Facing the boat or the boat in the background. I think what we would rely on is somebody like Chad and our vendor who's done this, like, all over the midwest, to come in and be like, okay, like, how do you want to face it? You know, certainly, I think probably something that's gonna capture the river, you know, behind them. I think that would be ideal. But until we kind of get down there and get a feel for the park and that. Right, you know, space, I don't really want to commit to exactly the configuration until we're down there with our vendor and public works and Chad and make that decision. We would also utilize our landscape architect, Zach Peterson. He's played a pretty pivotal role in the development of many of our parkland along the riverfront. So he would be a great asset to include in this discussion as well as we move forward. I think this looks really sharp, Dave. I love it. Thanks, Kelly. Appreciate that. Yeah, that's a great idea. There's no question about that. And I'm sure you can always call your friends at DDP to help with any possible graffiti removal. They've become experts at that with the technology. We talked about just a bunch of different locations, obviously being very aware of Main street landing, too, and knowing that we're going to have some construction down there. We talked about Union Station, and then we just felt like the park just made the best sense for that first one, just based on the number of people that are going to come off the ships. And let's try that and then think through, like, all right, where are some other ideal spots that maybe we could consider moving forward? But our plan would be to do it at River Heritage first and then kind of see where we go. Any other questions for Dave and the team? Do you have any other questions for us? Any questions for that? Thank you very much for being here. Appreciate your time. Yeah, thank you. It's a great idea. Appreciate you very much. Thanks for all what you do. Yeah. Have a good afternoon. Thanks. Thanks for being here. Of course. Thanks for having us. Thanks, Courtney. All right, up next, we have the approval of the Nesbitterina lease. We have a copy of that Courtney, I know we went over this last month, but you want to kind of give us. Sure. Absolutely. So for the Nestle Purina lease, the one thing that we have tried to be pretty consistent with all of our leases in the last year is giving a 5% increase. So you might have heard me talk about that at our last meeting. So we did look at an annual 5% increase, but something that I do want to share that's kind of new as it pertains to the Nestle Purina lease in specific, is previously we had written in the lease that we would actually take on the cost of resurfacing the lot. And as I started doing a little bit more research and figuring out what the cost was to actually redo the lot, it's upwards of $2,700. So if you think about it from a mathematical standpoint, when you're looking at 2700 to redo a lot and you're only annually charging 6300, that's a pretty big. That's a pretty big cut to take. So, in speaking with Nestle Purina about whether we stick to the word shell or may, we had come to an agreement that we may, as a city, decide or as the commission decide, to go ahead and resurface their lot. But we also shared the sentiment of how much it actually cost and shared the numbers with them, and they were very agreeable that. That they would agree that the word shell is not necessary, given the cost of how much it actually takes to maintain that lot. And like I said, they were agreeable. And so we will keep the wording. We may decide to do it, should we decide, but we are not bound to that agreement. That's a gravel lot, isn't it? That's correct. Over there. And the upgrade is just new gravel, or is it? Yes. No, it would be to implement new gravel and then even that out accordingly and so forth. But it still. It's pretty costly to do that if you're doing that on a yearly basis. So. So, yeah. So, really, the only change to this lease, again, is the 5% increase. Do we need a motion on this one? So for this one in particular, we can. If you would like to go ahead and move this along, we actually could go ahead and move it along today if you would like to make a motion to approve that motion. Do you have a second? No. 2nd. 2nd motion. A second? Do I have any discussion? All those in favor say aye. Aye. Extensions. All right, excellent. We'll go ahead and approve that. Thanks for the update. All right. Emphasize that the management update.

No, it would be to implement new gravel and then even that out accordingly and so forth. But it still. It's pretty costly to do that if you're doing that on a yearly basis. So. So, yeah. So, really, the only change to this lease, again, is the 5% increase. Do we need a motion on this one? So for this one in particular, we can. If you would like to go ahead and move this along, we actually could go ahead and move it along today if you would like to make a motion to approve that motion. Do you have a second? No. 2nd. 2nd motion. A second? Do I have any discussion? All those in favor say aye. Aye. Extensions. All right, excellent. We'll go ahead and approve that. Thanks for the update. All right. Emphasize that the management update. All right, so we feel like this meeting will be a little short, but good. But we do have a few things to update you on. So I'm gonna let Stephanie go first, and then I have a few items as well. Perfect. Do you want me to cover this, or did. You can go ahead. Yeah. So I believe we've talked about this before, but before Alderman Condon finished up his term, he had a pot of money left over that he was looking to allocate to something that would make a difference. And so, initially, we had talked about signage at river heritage, found that the timeline might not work, the money that might not get us quite as far as we hoped. And so the other thing that he had brought up was all of the Christmas lighting down at the freight house. All of the strung lighting is in not the best condition, and is very dull and all of that. And so had asked, like, what would it look like if we got, like, the nice, kind of, like, cafe style lighting? And so we have been working with facilities maintenance, and they met with Chad Minch from Tri City to get a quote, just kind of on what that would look like. So the quote came back a little bit high. So we kind of moved some things around. As far as, you know, maybe let's not polite in here. There are a couple electrical upper upgrades that we'll need to sustain the lighting. So we're just waiting back on a revised, kind of pared down quote on that. But once we have that information, we're hoping to go ahead and move forward with the lighting purchase. The new lighting will be installed after the roofing gutters are complete. So hopefully later in the summer, early fall. On that one, JJ said he was gonna get up and do it himself. He did. So I would think that would take off the labor. He did offer that we were just trying to find the most safe and efficient. But the businesses have all been. They've all been informed that that's coming, and everybody's very, very excited about that. So we're looking forward to that. Speaking of the freight house, if you've been down there in, like, the last week, they've started demolition on the diner stairs that lead up to their balcony. There were some cracks in, I believe, the bottom four stairs. And so we chose to kind of move ahead with getting that whole thing taken care of. So they started demo last Tuesday. I did touch base with facilities maintenance this morning. They said the rain has held them up a little bit as far as construction timeline, but that they are moving along kind of as scheduled. So they were pretty happy with that. And I could just touch a little bit on the stairs, so wanted to make sure that we were really clear that the structure of the stair itself, there was no crack in the structure of the stair. Those stairs, if you've ever been there and looked at it, they're actually concrete steps, so molded concrete steps. And it was the actual mold of the concrete that had cracks in the bottom of it. So it was the bottom four that we were made aware of. And then, like Stephanie said, in an effort to be proactive, we just decided to go ahead and replace all of the steps. So that's really how we got to that point, what it really entailed. And then, like Steph said, we hope to have that completed within the next few weeks. When was that staircase built? I actually don't know. I could look for you. Any questions? Great. And then on the opposite end of the freight house, the parapet and lintel repair down on the farmer's market end has been going on for a couple of weeks. I've been in touch with that construction crew almost daily. They should be wrapping work up, if not today, I'm guessing because of the rain in the next two days. So they have been really wonderful to work with. Were very accommodating with the farmers market, trying to, you know, not close that down. We were able to work around that, and it sounds like everything has gone extremely well as far as that. So hopefully, by the end of week, they will be done and moving out on that part, so. Okay, let's see here. Water fountains at the farmers market. Yeah. So one of the things that we wanted to ask, and we recognize this is kind of lower on the totem pole, so to speak, but really just wanted to get your input on. We currently have water fountains at the farmer's market. They do not or haven't used them, actually, since COVID So they've been shut off and not turned back on, partially because it sometimes can attract people to come into that space when the area is not open. So they've decided to keep that off. But in speaking with Missy and the board, they really are either. Or they could either keep them or not keep them. And so I struggle with that a little bit, because I'm like, well, if we have an ADA accessible asset there, and it is Ada accessible, part of me would really like to make that a possibility and turning those back on. I know we have lots of people who are on the trail. That's another area in which they can fill up, but certainly you wouldn't want to make that decision without some further discuss", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Tri City\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Working with facilities maintenance\",\n            \"Providing quotes for lighting improvements\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"buy\",\n        \"comment\": \"Tri City is actively engaged in providing solutions for improvements, which indicates a proactive approach to business.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Freight House\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Starting demolition on the diner stairs to address cracks\",\n            \"Proactively replacing cracked stairs\",\n            \"Ongoing parapet and lintel repair\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"buy\",\n        \"comment\": \"Freight House is making necessary improvements and repairs, demonstrating a commitment to maintaining its property.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Farmers Market\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Started parapet and lintel repair\",\n            \"Accommodating with the construction crew to avoid disruptions\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"buy\",\n        \"comment\": \"Farmers Market is ensuring structural repairs while minimizing disruption, indicating good management.\"\n    }\n]", "esg_v1": "[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Tri City\",\n    \"insights\": [\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Tri City is involved in providing quotes for new, energy-efficient lighting at the freight house.\",\n        \"classification\": \"E\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Freight House\",\n    \"insights\": [\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Freight House is replacing old, dull lighting with new, cafe-style lighting.\",\n        \"classification\": \"E\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Freight House is upgrading electrical systems to support new lighting.\",\n        \"classification\": \"E\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Freight House is conducting repairs on the diner stairs due to cracks in the concrete steps.\",\n        \"classification\": \"S\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Freight House is performing parapet and lintel repairs on the farmer's market end while accommodating the farmer's market operation.\",\n        \"classification\": \"S\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Freight House is considering whether to turn water fountains back on, considering both accessibility and potential misuse.\",\n        \"classification\": \"S\",\n        \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]", "esg_v2": [{"name": "Tri City", "insights": [{"observation": "Tri City is involved in providing quotes for new, energy-efficient lighting at the freight house.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Freight House", "insights": [{"observation": "Freight House is replacing old, dull lighting with new, cafe-style lighting.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Freight House is upgrading electrical systems to support new lighting.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Freight House is conducting repairs on the diner stairs due to cracks in the concrete steps.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Freight House is performing parapet and lintel repairs on the farmer's market end while accommodating the farmer's market operation.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Freight House is considering whether to turn water fountains back on, considering both accessibility and potential misuse.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 953176, "chunk_end_time": 1365680, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDn75OSWTvc", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDn75OSWTvc&t=953s"}, {"start": 19000, "end": 25000, "text": "the farmers market.

I know we have lots of people who are on the trail. That's another area in which they can fill up, but certainly you wouldn't want to make that decision without some further discussion or discretion. So just kind of wanted to throw it out to the group and see what your thoughts were on that. How many are there? There's just two. There's two of them. Are they right outside the door by, like, that big scale thing, or are they inside by the bathrooms? No, they're on the outside, I believe that's what I was thinking. Do we have any other fountains along the riverfront? We do, there are some. Yeah. Yeah, right at Gainesville, there's like a little doggy wand, and then there's. Yes, there are a lot of people around that area. I mean, around the freight house, too. Has that been a problem? So, in speaking with the farmers market, for them, the only issue that they dealt with, and they did say they were like, again, this was, you know, prior to Covid, the only issue that they had dealt with was having people come up to that space and occupy that space when the farmers market itself wasn't open. So that just from a safety perspective, that was a concern. But one of the things that our facilities maintenance shared with us is that they could make it to where the on and off nozzle, the farmer's market, could actually turn it off when the farmers market is not operating, so that people wouldn't be able to access that during those times. Therefore, kind of leaving out a safety concern. So it'd be a way that they could take a special tool or something to shut it off. Yeah, they could control it and then turn it off. That sounds like it's a compromise. Yeah, I didn't think that was a bad idea. You could try it. Try it and see what happens. And if it becomes a problem, then we go back to leaving it off permanently. I think that sounds good. And then we talked about just some things that they haven't done in the past, which would be like, properly winterizing some of those water lines. We regularly do that in the parks. Our parks department knows how to do that, and so does our facilities maintenance team. So that was just something for ongoing maintenance that we would try this year if you all were agreeable to that. We have been talking, I think, the last couple meetings about the freight house utilities. So we have actually started meeting with each of the tenants to let them know how utilities are going to be build out beginning in May. We had our first meeting with the farmers market last week. It went very, very well. So we will be meeting with the other tenants in the coming weeks to prepare them for that shift in utility billing coming up in May. So, yeah, look forward to that. The marquette docs, I've just wanted to give an update on that. Our parks department had gotten a call about two or three weeks ago that there were a number of things wrong with the docs. And so I met, Reid is our doc guy. I met with Reid last week just to kind of check everything out. There is a handrail that is really loose. There is a float missing from one of the docks. And then as you're pulling your boat in, there's kind of like little rubber bumpers essentially on either side just to keep the boat safe. There's a section that looks like it's been torn off. And so we kind of talked through all three of those things, do post some safety hazard. So Reid is going to be getting the proper materials ordered for those and is going to work to get those things replaced. He said the float should be in by the end of this week and then pending good weather next week, they can get down there and get everything installed. And he said that should move pretty quickly. It should be maybe a day's work or so. So do we inspect those like annually or on any kind of schedule or was this kind of like reported from someone who might be using it or like a potential user? Both. So we do, we do inspect annually with Reed. Reed actually comes out at the beginning of the season or a little bit before the season starts and does an inspection. But if we ever receive a call from a citizen, we would definitely, this was actually the result of that. We received a call from a citizen and sent someone out to go and look at that. Just a side note. So for some of our newer people or some of who haven't been with us for very long, so as you can imagine, managing docs is a really specialized field. And so Reid, he's one of the only people I honestly give my cell phone number to. He's wonderful and is very, very attentive to our docs. And he informed us that he would be retiring this year. So something that we, we were a little nervous, but something that, two things that he's done for. So he has referred us to someone else that he knows that does this. So we are super appreciative of that, but also notified us that this would be his last year with us. He has been doing this with us for a number of years. So I certainly want to figure out a way to thank him or even invite him to a meeting because he really is just one of those people. Like, you can pick up the phone and call him right away and he will just run out and help you. Really great guy.

Very thankful that he's giving us another resource beat because while we certainly pay him, that can be a very costly expense and just something that we want to think about as we continue our future planning and development. Courtney, I'm just curious. We sort of had an issue with, you know, our other docs. Did we get them in, you know, the timing of all that, knowing what our plan is, do we have that sort of phased in this for this? So making sure that we're credit island and just like all we talked about that I remember. But what I can't remember what we finally decided. Are we going to put credit island? Yes. So I believe our notes. I can double check our notes from last. This was like last fall, I think. But yes, I believe our notes were to go ahead and move forward with credit island. So that would be the plan this year. And then in the future we actually do have an extra set of docks that are sitting in storage that we could put at busey. But they. Is that on Concord? Yes, but they do need some repairs to that specific dock set. So if that is something that we want to move forward with, then I would just say that we would want to budget for that in the coming fiscal year. I think we should do that because I think there's a lot of use on that. Yeah, I think we should do. The busey docks in the past have always been like, people really highly covet us getting those in. So I think that's really important that we should plan to budget for that. That's an amenity that I think people rely upon. Yep. And what's the status on Lindsey park? The channel cat dock might be a little off the subject. No, that's a document. It is. Let me get an update on that one. I haven't heard anything recently. So let me get an update on that one. We do. I mean, it was budgeted, I thought, or there's definitely been plans to put a whole new deal in there for the channel cat. Right? There was. Yep. We. I want to say we had visited that quite some time ago, but yes, there were definitely plans. Any other? Not any more that's been sent? That's been several years, actually. Seems to me that that's been talked about getting that new. It's been a couple years anyway, hasn't it, Kelly? Yeah. And we had quite a bit of traction on it. I think it was last fall where we brought it to the table because that's when we started getting updates from them, but I haven't heard since, so we will circle back on that one. Great. Any other questions on the docs? Okay, so my last piece, and this is actually included in everybody's packet as well. For anybody that's new, I'll give you a little bit of background. So, typically, the riverfront improvement mission is the presenter of our summer concert series. Typically that has fallen on Sunday evenings during the summer, anywhere from six to eight concerts. If you have not attended those concerts, you would not be the only people not there. They are very poorly attended. Last year, I would say we averaged probably between 25 and 40 people consistently. It was usually about the same 25 to 40 people other than Central High School, which brought in several hundred people. So one of the things that Courtney had kind of tasked me with, and one of the things I wanted to do was to kind of revamp the series a little bit. Moving into this year, I figured there were ways to maybe attract different demographics than we have in the past, utilize some resources that we haven't really tapped into, and also just to get some different genres of music. So we have been working pretty closely with common cord since September, I would say, to kind of figure out what we wanted this to look like. The idea we came up with was the big nine concert series. We have 9 miles of riverfront here in Davenport, so we have picked nine different locations. One location repeated that. We will be holding concerts over the summer. We have been utilizing common court in the sense that they have been kind of lining up all of the talent for us, since that is obviously their area, not mine, and they've been doing a really wonderful job of that. So, as of now, this is what our lineup looks like. I'm really excited that we're going to be moving to a lot of different locations. We'll be utilizing the west end a little bit, as well as the east end. We will be having a concert on top of the last picture house, which I'm most excited about. Yes. So, yeah, the majority of these concerts will also be bringing in some food vendors. Some of them, such as the Ruby's outdoor stage. Obviously, Ruby's and low pies are right there. People can utilize those. That concert in particular. We are waiting to confirm the time frame to coordinate with the BiCs at six. The thought is that as people are finishing up running the Bics at six on that evening, that they'll hopefully come on over and enjoy some music. So excited about that. We've got one in conjunction with Red, white, and boom. We're bringing back.

"text": "their area, not mine, and they've been doing a really wonderful job of that. So, as of now, this is what our lineup looks like. I'm really excited that we're going to be moving to a lot of different locations. We'll be utilizing the west end a little bit, as well as the east end. We will be having a concert on top of the last picture house, which I'm most excited about. Yes. So, yeah, the majority of these concerts will also be bringing in some food vendors. Some of them, such as the Ruby's outdoor stage. Obviously, Ruby's and low pies are right there. People can utilize those. That concert in particular. We are waiting to confirm the time frame to coordinate with the BiCs at six. The thought is that as people are finishing up running the Bics at six on that evening, that they'll hopefully come on over and enjoy some music. So excited about that. We've got one in conjunction with Red, white, and boom. We're bringing back. The band that we've had the past couple years, they've been very highly regarded, so we're really excited about that. And then the final concert will be out at Credit islands. We are looking to book three bands for that one to kind of do a throwback to the Mississippi River GM from the seventies when they brought in, like, the Doobie brothers and Journey and really cool groups. We don't have a budget. We do not. No, no. Just want to say it on camera. On camera. Recorded. But common Cord has reached out to some bands that were popular bands in the Quad Cities during that time frame. They, unfortunately, two of the three that they were really excited about already have other commitments those days, but one of them did say yes. So they are looking to get hopefully two more that we can pull in on that one. But, yeah, so this is kind of where a lot of my time is being devoted to right now, just trying to figure out, you know, all of the logistics and all of that. So we hope to announce the series in April, even if that's just dates and locations, and then kind of roll out the bans as we get a little bit closer to summer. But I'm really hopeful that this will do a good job of drawing in some different crowds than what we've had previously. So, does anybody have any questions? There's the moonshine run, the very first band. What kind of music do they play? Do you know? I do not know. Common cord went ahead. They did all of the bookings. Most of these bands I'm not familiar with, but I kind of let them take the reins on that. They did say that they are familiar with all of the bands that they booked. No identity crisis on Wednesday, July 3. They are super good. They're really good. They are all former band instructors and teachers. Yeah. And they're very good. Well, and I like the changing up the date of the week, you know, the Sunday, it was kind of an afterthought. It's like, oh, well, now we're all getting ready for the week, and we don't want to go mess with that or whatever that is. But the kind of Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday nights, you know, when places are kind of already a bit activated, just kind of seems like a nice, natural synergy. So I think that's our big challenge, is just to get the word out, right? Yes. Yeah. We've been talking. We are going to do concert style posters that we can hopefully hang up in a bunch of businesses around the area and give to any commissioners that would like to put some up to. We are going to have shirts for all of our staff that have, like, the lineup on it. We've talked about potentially having, like, some shirt giveaways to kind of promote things as well. It'll be very heavy on social media. We're hoping to get out to all of the local news stations, all of that, and just really, you know, promote it hard and get the word out. I think another really nice thing is a lot of these groups have really big followings already, and so I think that will. That will bring some people in, too. So. So, Stephanie, these are free to people to come to, correct, which I think is great. And many years ago, I think, you know, the concert, the Sunday concert series was something that came from the Peterson fund, and it was, you know, there was an endowment for it, which. And, you know, that the people that went to it have sort of aged out, I think is fair to say, because it was. It was. Went for many, many, many years. But it would be good to sort of think through if there's a way to, you know, help fund some of this somehow. Right. I mean, I think this is a really valuable thing. I think it's a great thing for us to do for activation on the riverfront, but figuring out how we can do some things, maybe down the road, that helps us fund it more in perpetuity, would be great. I don't know what that is, but, you know, seems like there's opportunities. We have been talking about that for the last year. So Stephanie and I, as we continue, I am a big believer in, like, benchmark analysis and look at multiple cities and see how are they doing it right. And not that we need to copy other cities, but why reinvent the wheel if someone else has really mastered something? Well, so, and just even looking at, like, our surrounding cities, if you look at their summer concert series and you look at the marketing, you're gonna see sponsors from multiple area businesses. And why can't we have sponsors? I very, very, very strongly believe that we can have sponsors for our summer concert series. And so I think that, you know, as we go into this next year, this past year, I challenged Stephanie with come up and bring me something new, some type of new concert series. This next year, I'm going to challenge her with bring me some sponsors. And so, like I said, if you kind of look at that, she's writing that, but if you look at that, if you look at anyone else, they have a bunch of sponsors. And like I said, I see no reason why we can't get them as well. But one of the things that I think is super cool that I just wanted to give her kudos on for this summer concert series i", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Ruby's\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Ruby's is participating in the concert series as a food vendor, indicating community engagement.\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"buy\",\n        \"comment\": \"Ruby's involvement in the community event shows positive community engagement and potential increased foot traffic.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Low Pies\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Low Pies is participating in the concert series as a food vendor, indicating community engagement.\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"buy\",\n        \"comment\": \"Low Pies\u2019 involvement in the community event shows positive community engagement and potential increased foot traffic.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Common Cord\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Common Cord is responsible for booking bands and bringing popular groups to the area, showing effective event coordination.\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"buy\",\n        \"comment\": \"Common Cord's effective management and coordination in booking popular bands demonstrate its strength and reliability in event management.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Credit Islands\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Credit Islands is a venue for a major concert, indicating it is being utilized for significant community events.\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"buy\",\n        \"comment\": \"As a venue for a major concert, Credit Islands shows potential for increased community engagement and event-driven foot traffic.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Peterson Fund\",\n        \"positives\": [\n            \"Peterson Fund provided endowments for previous Sunday concert series, indicating a strong history of supporting community events.\"\n        ],\n        \"negatives\": [],\n        \"decision\": \"inconclusive\",\n        \"comment\": \"The Peterson Fund has a history of supporting community events, but further details about its current involvement are needed.\"\n    }\n]", "esg_v1": "[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Common Cord\",\n    \"insights\": [\n      {\n        \"observation\": \"Common cord went ahead.

But one of the things that I think is super cool that I just wanted to give her kudos on for this summer concert series is it is a combination of parks and locations and area businesses, which I think is really, really neat and something that we've not. Not tried before for this specific concert series. The other piece to this is, as well, she gave a lot of kudos to our friends at common court, which they 100% deserve because they are phenomenal work with. I also. I really want to give her a lot of kudos as well, because there is so much that goes behind the scenes other than the actual band and entertainment itself, everything from organizing the electrical to having food trucks that are licensed and supported at these events to getting entertainment. So, for example, she's actually. She didn't share this with you, but she actually themed each one of these events. So, for example, like, the veterans Memorial park one. Like, there's going to be flags for kiddos, and there's, like, a. Kind of, like, a barbecue theme. So she's having, like, multiple barbecue vendors there and ice cream trucks. So it feels. She organizes all that. She does, yes. So. So that's. Yeah, so. So that's. You know, she. She might not tell you that stuff, but I get to kind of see those things. I think so, too. So that's part of the question that I had. You were considering partnerships where, you know, special tickets or you get a drink at this place before the concert? Kind of a. Yeah, almost like, you know, you could. You could even buy, like, a ticket for the series. Right. Which would be different than one offs. You know, maybe if I'm gonna buy, you know, a ticket for the entire series, you know, I get a discount cost of all that. But if I'm gonna. I just want to do the one offs because I don't know if I'm gonna be in town, I'll pay a little more. But, you know, and it doesn't have to be, like, huge amounts of money, but I think there is sometimes people value when things more, if they have to, you know, have a ticket for it. Stop by the bar before the concert. And we did kind of like riverfront pops. You know, they have their own special section. Yeah. You know, the bank, and then that's, like the vip kind of close to the. You know, maybe we could even do something similar. But, yeah, there's a lot of opportunities. So I think that that's great. This looks wonderful. Thank you. Thank you. Nice work. I'll just tack on one more thing, because I am excited about this. So looking ahead to next year already, I had reached out to Reagan, which is one of our newer businesses downtown, a while back. I'm a big fan of their shirts. And so I had kind of said, like, hey, we're gonna be doing this concert series. Like, what about concert shirts? And they were like, yes, this sounds fantastic. And then as I started getting more into the planning, I was like, okay, that seems like a good year two thing, but I think that will also be a really good publicity piece in year two. Is having one year of this under our belts. Hopefully, it is a wild success and we want to do it again. And then being able to partner with Reagan, I think, can also help on the sponsorship front. So creative, too. I don't know if you've talked to them about a donation, because they'll do shirts and have a percentage of proceeds go to a program. So we use them for Ted TEDx import one year to make shirts, and then any shirts were sold. You get x percent off of that. They're taking the rest. But it's free money. Yeah. And free publicity. Okay, wonderful. Thank you. We also in partnership with. Did we share about the grant that common core? No, I think. Was it our. Was it RDA? Yes. So common core did secure some funds through the RDA in the fall that will be used for specifically towards this. So that is kind of a nice little added piece to this as well. Any questions? So are they. I mean, I know common court is contributing a lot, but in terms of the visibility, the credit of this whole event is the city as well as Common Core going to get. Yes. So there will be billing for the Riverfront Improvement Commission, the city of Davenport Common Court, and then the RDA will be mentioned as well. So it'll be titled the Riverfront Improvement Commission in partnership with Common Cord. Yeah. Cool. Well done. Thank you. That's so much better than an email. All right. Up next to the parkway. Not enough. You gotta talk. I don't know. You gotta top that. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. We had a fairly short meeting. We had another kind of big group from Windsor Crest because they're pretty gung ho about that park thing that I mentioned last month. So we actually did do a vote to pass it on our recommendation, the parks advisory board, to city council, that the city at least start moving forward. However that looks with reaching out, maybe to the school board or doing some plans. And there were some rough plans coming from the park staff about what they would do with that land. And honestly, their recommendation and their master plans recommendation was that that would be a good place for a neighborhood park in an area ", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\":

So we actually did do a vote to pass it on our recommendation, the parks advisory board, to city council, that the city at least start moving forward. However that looks with reaching out, maybe to the school board or doing some plans. And there were some rough plans coming from the park staff about what they would do with that land. And honestly, their recommendation and their master plans recommendation was that that would be a good place for a neighborhood park in an area where there are no neighborhood parks for quite a distance. So, yeah, we passed that along and it's Kyle and the rest decision. And the big obstacle is obviously just the cost of mainly purchasing the land because they don't have big goals for big elaborate development or playgrounds or anything. They just want a fairly simple park. So if the city and the school board can work something out, maybe that can be our newest park out there. Can you remind me of that location? That was eastern. 46 and eastern. Is that cornfield? That's the school district own zap. They always have. Yeah. And I guess they don't want to anymore. And the neighbors are. They want the city to grab it for a park because there's not a park basically, in a huge area out there. I mean, there's. Some of the maps just show, like, a huge. I don't think I have any with me, but they'll show little radiuses. Like a neighborhood park is supposed to have, like, a half mile radius, and there's just no neighborhood parks anywhere. Like, north of Kimberly and east of Brady, really. And, like, south of 53rd, that's a huge area with a lot of neighborhoods. So it's basically everybody's for it. If somebody can find the money for it, which sounds. That's the hard part, then another one that kind of relates to the riverfront is, I guess, some native grasses that were growing, apparently plenty down at Quinlan Court were relocated up to the former playground at Tyler park, which is my neighborhood park. They built a new playground at Tyler park, and the old park was kind of up on top of a hill with a low visibility area that was not great for it. And they had a big dirt hole, I think. And they've turned that into kind of a natural prairie type area with some of the native grasses that were excessive at Quinlan Court. So it's kind of a win win of thinning out the look at Quinlan and improving a neighborhood park. And then part of the potential park at 46 and Eastern, Chad talked a little bit about. That's kind of his win win win for that area could be a potentially new location for a junior theater complex not too far from the existing junior theater complex. And that land is more than a neighborhood park needs, so there's potentially room there for more things. But he kind of talked about that after the Windsor crest neighbors had left. So I don't know where they're at on a potential theater being built there, but it seems logical to me and then guys are spending a lot of money at these park coordinators. We're just recommending. We're recommending. Well, actually, no, there was a lot of talk from council about supporting Judy theater in a new location, but, yeah, then there was a little update on the trail committee that I mentioned that they're still trying to form up. They're really wanting to pull in eight ward representatives and two at large representatives. It's not going to be like an official city board or commission like this, or parks advisory, but kind of a casual committee that basically follows a lot of the same guidelines. They already got a grant for some new signage along the bike paths or the recreational trails, I should say. And they have plans for ten events. Some of those, I think, are existing events, like get out and trail or some of the bike to work type things. Who's they? Who's doing it? The trail committee, that barely exists yet, but there's some people from park staff on it. Mike, shirts from the Parks advisory board is a representative on there. And they are already reaching out to, like, the Quad City bicycle Club and corn belt and the bigs and just basically anybody that uses recreational trails to make this kind of a big deal committee to get some stuff done. And I was impressed that they're already, they literally already got a grant when they've only had, I think, two official meetings and don't even really have a lot of members yet. So, Chris, does this just like, expand the trail system? I think all aspects of advocating for trails, I mean, that would be part of it. And then just upgrading the trails we have, publicizing the trails we have. Even like the off road, right on Marquette street by the dog park. Yeah, I think they've reached out to fork. Friends of off road cycling and most other local communities have a trails committee. I think that was part of the initiative, was like, why don't we have one? And this year and last year, there's actually some stuff happening with new trails in Davenport, so it seemed ripe. And Mike shirts particularly, he's very happy that stuff is moving forward. He was. I don't know if anybody's still on this commission, but he was my predecessor as the liaison between parks advisory to this commission, so, yeah, that's exciting. Are they coordinating with other quad cities? I think so, yes. They've already reached out to Bettendorf, I think, just for the model of how to have a trails commission.

And I think they all work together pretty well. But we needed our own if everybody else had theirs, I guess. And then finally, one of our members that's kind of an environmental consultant, asked if it had ever been talked about at riverfront improvement commission about power generation along the river, and I said, no, not at any meeting I've been to, but that I would throw it out there. It was mentioned by Chad that the corps might be the more appropriate venue for that corps of engineers. But I do know years ago there was an article in the Times about low, they called it low fall power generation. I think instead of needing a really tall dam with a lot of, like, distance that the water goes down, there is a way with modern technology to generate power from something like our loch and dam or just the general flow of the river. It's a lot of, you know, power, essentially, energy that's moving down there. But I said I would pass it along. I said, I don't know that this commission is the right group to move forward with that, but it would be kind of neat, even, like, if we could work with. With some company that did something like that to do, like just a demonstration model type of thing and have a little kiosk with, like, informational, you know, there's some interesting ideas there, but it's a potentially real big project that's specialized and outside of all of our wheelhouses, and I think that was about it that had any relation to the riverfront. Thanks so much, Chris. All right. And we scared off our only public with business. I guess I'll go ahead and open the floor for anyone. My question was, on the visit, were you asking for action in a future meeting? Yep. So this meeting was really for consideration. At the next meeting, I would request that some type of motion be made so that if you're in support of this as a whole, because it would need to go through. So, as Dave was saying, signs are not always the easiest and would need to go through a few people in order to make that happen. So we would certainly want to work with parks and public works and a few other. A few other areas, now that I'm thinking about it. So. So, yes, if you would take some time to consider this, and then at our next meeting, if we could get a motion to move forward, if this is something that you would like to see. Time enough. What is that? Time enough? I mean, is that enough time to make everything work? What Dave was talking about, they want to have it in place for. The first docking is in June. Oh, June. Well, April, end of month, end of June. I'm not sure. I think they're buying the sign regardless, and then they need to figure out where they're going to put the first one. Any of us have any opposition? We think it's a great idea, don't we? I think theoretically, it sounds promising, but, you know, hearing kind of more details, placement, working with parks, making sure that it kind of checks a lot of boxes. Yeah, I think I'm most interested in, you know, Mary's question about, you know, how are you. How are you actually putting it in there? And I'm sure that that's what you're talking about, probably, Kyle, is, you know, what it takes for all the permitting, logistics. And so it is funny that you get into these very. They seem minute, and you start getting into the nitty gritty of putting a sign out there, and then somebody says, why would you put a sign that says Quad Cities and Davenport? And then the conversation starts. But also, that park is really the riverfront improvement Commission's park. This commission really moved to create that park before I was on the council. And you've seen it to fruition. There is a plan that's very natural and historic. And so I think asking. It's got plans for future build out. And so talking with Zach and making sure that this is in line with the design is probably prudent as well. And I think this is movable. Right. So if in five to ten years, that's supposed to be like a natural prairie with running water and all, if you end up getting that funded, you go, we can take that. We can move it to the east village, we can move it to main street landing. But those are all the types of things that you consider as you move through with it. I mean, it's definitely nicer than the little steak signs that they put out there every time the boat comes. Absolutely. Yeah. I'd be happy to connect with Chad and Zach and see if they might join us at our next meeting to just talk through this a little bit further, or at least have them run by them and see what they say if there's a master plan for that, because Zach is the one who's kind of designed that whole thing. Yes. And to be honest with you, we actually work quite a bit with Zach at least weekly. Steph and I do. Yeah. So we do. He's a good guy and really open to ideas, but certainly we want to honor the longevity of the planning and. And your wishes as well. So something to think about, I guess.

We're happy you're participating in your city government, but ask that your participation please reflect the common desire we all share to make Danport a better place for the folks in here. Just as a reminder, if you'd be kind enough to put these on silent or turn them off, simply that they don't get in the way of anybody talking. If you want to address the council on an agenda item tonight, wait for the chair to recognize you. But please come to the podium. The microphone's above you. We'd love to know your name, order, address, and if you're not from here, we'd love to know where you're from. And you'll have five minutes. Please address the council and staff as one body and not any individual. We'll be respectful of you and please be respectful of us. Thank you. Miss Merritt. Is there city administrator update tonight? Nothing tonight, your honor. Very good. Okay, we have four public hearings. One under community development and three under public works. We'll start with community development. Alderman Gripp, please. Thank you, your honor. I open the public hearing for case ord 240, two being the request of the the city of Davenport to amend chapter 17.08 entitled uses of the Municipal Code of Davenport, Iowa by updating the billboard definition and principal use standards. Is there anyone from the public here to comment on this public hearing? Please step to the lectern. State your name and address. Award Derek cornett, 7th Ward if you're going to update it, I think that something you should take into consideration is do not allow companies to advertise illegal things in our state. If it's illegal in our state, don't let them advertise it here. Might be legal in Illinois, but it's not legal here, so don't let them advertise it. And if we do let them advertise it, it's just giving the people permission to go to Illinois and bring it back. Thank you. Anyone else from the public, state your name and address. Reward, please. Gary Eklund and I live in Alderman McKelley's ward. I'm not sure I mentioned before that I know from previous experience that not all of the alder people read all of the so called green sheets, even if they're on the computer these days. I don't know if they still actually give you green sheets. And this one doesn't really explain what the change would be. Freedom of speech is important, and it mentions billboards and not signs. But as the mayor would remember from a letter I wrote to him, the public works department not very long ago declared it illegal for me to have one single sign in my yard, in my backyard in a tight turnaround. And I don't know whether this is going to make billboards illegal or a certain size or no flashing lights. If it's no flashing lights in your eyes, then I'm in favor of it. Other than that, I'm probably opposed. But I want to emphasize, I had exactly one single sign in my yard. The city declared it illegal for me to have that sign in my backyard. And then when they came eventually on their two of their physical attacks, they went through my yard removing signs that said raspberry patch and blueberry patch and BlackBerry patch and these little garden signs like this that you buy at the store. The supervisor of code enforcement and parking lots, sir, do you have any. Do you have any comments about billboards? Well, I don't know if the billboards freedom of speech idea applies to everything, but I'm suggesting that the city should not be allowed to arbitrarily declare that signs are legal in everybody else's yards. But not in your yard and not in my yard. And send people to. I will sit down. You specifically have comments about. Well, I will sit down. If you are outlawing signs that flashlights and drivers eyes, please outlaw signs that flash lights in other people's eyes.

There's not a lot of really bad offenders right now in Davenport. But I think that's an issue for driver safety. Flashing lights. Flashing lights or police cars are great on signs. Not necessarily. But there's a freedom of speech issue here. And I'm in favor of freedom of speech. And that includes for you and for me, not just for you. Is there anyone else from the public here to comment on this item? State your name and address or ward, please. Diane Salmon, 8th ward. I also agree that the CBD pot signs need to be removed. We're sending a very bad message to our young people that it is okay to go to one state and come to another state when we know it's illegal. They are very impressionable at these ages. They're very impulsive at these ages. And it just does not give Davenport a good look to have signs for something that's illegal. We would never put up signs for underage drinking. We would never put up signs for human trafficking. Something that would be encouraged. These kids don't know the difference between right and wrong if they haven't been raised in a good home and with good morals. So we're sending a bad message to these kids. Go to Illinois. Bring it back. You're okay. It's not fair for our police department to be overwhelmed with those kinds of petty things when we have so many other things going on. So please be careful what we're portraying Davenport to be. Because right now we're struggling. We got 339 days since the building collapse. Our city's always in the news for something bad. Let's talk about billboards. I'm getting there. Thank you. You're welcome. So anyway, we need to be in the news for something good. And it's not good when we're putting up signs for something that is illegal. We want to have a good city again. So we need appropriate billboards for our city. That's it. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public who's here to comment on this item? Seeing no one, I moved to close the public. Second. I have a motion and a second. All in favor? Aye. Are there any opposed? This public hearing has been closed. Thank you, alderman. Grip. Next. Public hearings are under public works. Alderman Dunn and Alderman Kelly will discuss. Alderman Dunn, please open the first public hearing on the plan specification form a contract and estimated cost for the Emerald Drive reconstruction project. Is there anyone to public wishing to address this public hearing? Seeing none, I move to close the public hearing. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Any opposed? Same sign. This public hearing is closed. I open the second public hearing on the plan specification, form a contract and estimated cost for the East Locust Street Grand Avenue to Eastern Avenue resurfacing project. Is there anyone to the public wishing to address this public hearing? Seeing none, I move to close the public hearing. A motion in a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Any opposed? Same sign. This public hearing is closed. I open the third public hearing on the plan specification, form a contract and estimated cost for the water pollution control plant and compost facility, flood mitigation, stormwater and a fluid pumping system project. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this public hearing? Gary Eckland. I live in Davenport. I live in Alderman Kelly's ward. I will be very brief if you let me speak. It mentions water pollution control, flood mitigation, stormwater. Part of stormwater and water pollution control involves illegal dumping of items such as brand new cans of unopened paint. I'm asking that your public works department and a police officer in the room be arrested for illegal dumping of paint into the water supply. No. No. Yeah. Anyone else? People should be arrested for crimes. Please sit down, Gary. Thank you. Anyone else seeing none, I moved to close the public hearing. We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Same sign. This public hearing is closed, and that concludes public hearings for this evening. Your honor, back to you. Thank you. Alderman Donald Kelly. Next area is proclamations.

The Davenport Skybridge will display the color green Monday, May 27, 2024 through Sunday, June 2, 2024. In recognition of Mental Health Awareness Month, dated this first day of May 2024, I move the proclamation second. All in favor? Aye. Aye. All opposed? I do have Heather Holman, president for the love of mental health, to accept this. So my name is Heather Holman. I am sorry. I'll give this to you. One, two, three. Thank you. You're welcome. My name is Heather Hallman. I am 41 years old. I started for love mental health in 2020 the thick of COVID and I just wrote a little speech here, so forgive me, I'm just gonna read it. We are for the love of mental health and our purpose is to create a safe space. Individuals can support one another through peer to peer counseling and resources within our community. We are overwhelmed with a gratitude to accept this proclamation and we will be honored to uphold our purpose and we will strive to get loud for mental health and to end the stigmas that come with it. For the love of mental health is a community organization that aims to improve mental health as a whole through positive activities, shared resources and listening ears. For love of mental health does offer free weekend activities as well as community get togethers. We host game nights, we have social hours, and we do lots of community give backs through free clothing drives, park cleanups and restorations. And we also help individuals wherever we can. We operate a peer to peer support group on Facebook called for the Love of mental health and we are a safe community of over 2100 members from over ten different countries, including Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa. Because mental health is a worldwide concern, when sharing our organization with the members in our community, we are shocked by just how many people misunderstand the difference between mental health and mental illness. Do not shadow mental illness. We want to emphasize that all humans do in fact have mental health. Your surroundings, your life circumstances, experiences can majorly affect it, seen or unseen by the naked eye. So we would like to thank the City of Davenport as well as Jessica Knowles for submitting for love mental health for this honor. And we also want to thank our amazing community, our admins and our team for their time and continuous support in the growth of for love mental health. We cannot express our appreciation enough and the community because the community adds value and continues to spread awareness and hope. So stay positive. Stay here and know that you are not alone.

Can I make a motion to move the proclamation? All in favor? Aye. Okay. Accepting this award today is David Ring, the vice president of Quad City Bicycle Club, and Michael Schurz, director of the adversary and safety of the Quad City Bike Gloves Club. So, I'm Tina Anderson and I'm the president of the Quadsity Bike Club. Congratulations. I cleared my schedule. So we appreciate just for submitting the proclamation. Proclamation. And we, as a club and community, do express condolences at the loss of gauge earlier this year. The Quad City Bike Club has been here in the Quad Cities in November 60 years. We're committed to advocating for biking for all on safe roads. We look forward to. We've had a great partnership with the City of Davenport over the years and look forward to continue to support as we know people like choices in transportation when they're looking for a community to bring their family, stay, grow. And we really have a good thing going and want to continue to see it move forward. So on behalf of the club and behalf of myself as a resident of ward four, thank you. Thank you. Next area is petitions and communications. I just want to say, looks like a nice weekend. So the parade house farmers market's opening. So please go enjoy that wonderful place. Anyone else? I see Alderwa mcGuinness. Thank you, your honor. Just a couple of things tonight. Folks living within 200ft of the Frank L. Smart school would have gotten their notice by now. But they're just wanted to let everybody know that in conjunction with planning and zoning, a hearing. A planning and zoning hearing. Because they were asking for vacation of part of a street there on their new campus. There will be a neighborhood meeting on Monday, May 7. I'm sorry, on May 7. I believe that's Tuesday, May 7 at 06:00 p.m. at Smart Middle School Library at 1934 West Fifth street. This is not just for the neighbors, but neighbors certainly received this. But it is obviously a public meeting as well. And then the commission. The public hearing for the planning and zoning commission will be May 14. And the time is 05:00. And that will be at council chamber, city hall. We will also be holding a sort of city meeting on May 23, which is a Thursday, May 23 at 06:30 p.m. at the school. And that's again a chance to take a look at the plans and to hear more about this project. So I just want to let everybody know about that. But that meeting is. The planning and zoning meeting comes up at the library on 5724 at 06:00 p.m. i. Also, there was some conversation last week about striping of city roads, which is always an interest in certainly something that we get calls about. I wanted to share a little. And right after the meeting last week that we got notification that we're beginning the striping project. So I don't know if everyone's aware of this, but here are a few facts. All of city streets are painted twice a year, typically in May and October. And so as you saw them out this week, they were, you know, beginning that process. The Dot routes, which are Kimberly Brady welcome way and Harrison and River Drive are painted in the spring, spring only. And their cost is reimbursed by the state of Iowa and then the rest are done by the city. And this happens two times a year. There are just, here's a fun fact. There are about 1286 lane miles of streets in our city, our 65 square mile city, the city that couldn't stop growing. But there's about 1200 miles of streets in the city. There are. That adds up to 1.2 millionft of lines to paint each time the city does the work. And the Dot's share of this is another 310,000ft of line. So that's all about the painting of our streets. And so you should see that. And they will be coming back again and doing that in October, just for your information. Thank you, your honor. Thank you, alderman Kelly. Thank you very much. First of all, I want to apologize for my tardiness. I was at a meeting with the school system of the black and brown educators and I thought I could be here on time. But I do apologize and I want to thank everybody that came out to my ward meeting last Thursday. We had an amazing time and a nice turnout. I would like to remind folks that on May 28 it'll be a year of the fall of 324 Maine and I will be hosting a program at third Baptist at 05:00 in the evening. That's two, two two west 14th street. It'll be a program of remembrance.

Thank you, alderman Kelly. Alderman Gripp. Thank you, your honor. I just wanted to provide a weekly update on the city administrator search. So now that we have selected a search firm, they are going to be here the week of May 13. So they'll be here Monday, May 13 and May 14. And Colin Bessinger and associates is the firm that we selected. On Monday he will be here to have a meeting with the search firm. That will happen in the afternoon and then he will also be a meeting with all of the elected officials. So you should have received something from Miss Jones setting up a time for that. So I will have an update for you after that initial meeting with the search firm. Thank you, your honor. Thank you, Alan McGriff. Anyone else? Very good. All right, we'll move to the four areas for discussion, which are community development, public safety, public works and finance. The first one is community development. Alderman Grip and alderman Reinerts will discuss. Alderman grip, please. Thank you. Your honor, we do have three items on our agenda this evening. Item number one is an ordinance for case ord 240. Two being the request of the City of Davenport to amend chapter 17.08 entitled uses of the Municipal Code of Davenport, Iowa, by updating the billboard definition and principal use standards. Is there anyone from the public who's here to comment on this item? Step to the lectern. State your name and address award, please. Derek Cornett, 7th ward. Same comment as before. Do not allow illegal things to be advertised in our city. Sets a bad precedent. Sets a bad example. And you don't have to look at me. You can just keep looking down. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public here to comment? Gary Ekman and I live in Davenport. And the same thing. I want to reiterate that freedom of speech is supposedly a well established principle. Freedom of speech and freedom of religion, freedom to put a sign in your yard, to have a sign in your backyard, is considered a well established principle in the United States everywhere except for here. I would appeal again to people who write these up to include a little bit more detail for those of us who are not online for one reason or another. And also because I assure you not every alderperson goes to every other committee meeting to read every detail. I know all the older people have lives and commitments and there is a lot of paperwork for everyone to read. And so putting a little bit more detail on here, you're adjusting the billboard standards somehow. But as somebody who's not online, I have no idea what you're talking about. But freedom of speech should apply to everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public here to comment on this item? Seeing no one will go to council comments. We'll start with Alderwoman McGinnis. Thank you very much, Miss Merritt. Are we allowed to dictate what's on billboards? Or if. Perhaps if you could answer for us. Typically, content is not regulated. However, if your question is are you allowed to ban things like cigarette advertisements or things of that nature, that's something that you could consider. Would we be likely sued for something like that? If we let other like alcohol or something like that be advertised, but not cigarettes or CBD oil or whatever? It's a concern that we would need to address if you wanted to go in that direction. Thank you. Anyone else from the council seeing? No one. I'll just make a brief comment. And, you know, when we do change an ordinance, that's why we have three readings, and it takes six weeks. So it gives the council enough time to take into consideration all of the information that they need to. I will say last year we had some electronic billboards that were installed on 53rd. Alderman Jovian there in his ward. He and I started to get calls from residents concerned about the brightness and their proximity to neighborhoods and if more would be going in. And so at that time, we just made the decision to put in a six month moratorium and do some research on our billboard ordinance and make sure that we were happy with what we had in place, because this was kind of the first time that we had seen, seen this number of electronic billboards go in. And so our staff has been researching the topic for several months. They brought it back. It's gone through planning and zoning. And here we are as a council to kind of take a look at it and decide if we're happy with that or not. So one of the things I like about it is it was done thoroughly, methodically.

We also looked at what are the standards that we should be basing these things off of? So certainly encourage the council to review all of the information that's provided in the green sheets. But I do want to say that's why we're here today. And I do think the staff did an excellent job of making a recommendation to us. So, seeing no other comments, we'll move on to item number two. Item number two is a resolution approving case f 20 312 being the request of Orville J. Berkestrand for a final plat of Daniel's Churchill's second edition, a two lot subdivision on 0.4 acres located at 1203 Jersey Ridge Road. Is there anyone from the public who here to comment on this item? Anyone from council seeing no one, this item moves on. Our final item is a resolution of support for the submission of an application to the state of Iowa high quality jobs program through a partial property tax exemption for the construction of a high tech data center project. Before we go to public with comment, I would ask Suzanne Knutson from our community development office to come up and tell us a little bit about this project. Hi, Suzanne Knudsen. I'm the economic development manager in community and economic development. To give you just kind of an overview of this project. It's a high tech data center campus that's considering a location of 328 acres here in Davenport. They are in their due diligence phase, so it is by no means a done deal. It's quite a significant project. It's $800 million of capital investment. It would be, at a minimum, 50 new jobs. The anticipated assessed valuation is 420 million. So what this resolution would do is authorize the council to support submission of their application to the state of Iowa high quality jobs program, and then it outlines the city support. And what that support we are proposing is a 60% tax abatement over a 20 year period. So all total, that would be about 160 million to the company starting year one. With that assessed valuation, the City of Davenport would recoup itself 2.5 million in regular taxation, and then the 40% of the regular property tax levy would be distributed to all the remaining taxing jurisdictions, like as a normal process. Thank you. We'll go to public with comment, and then if the council has any comments of staff or questions of staff, then we'll call you back up. I do also want to mention to the council that the petitioner does have a representative here if we have any questions for the petitioner. So let's go to public with comment. State your name and address or ward, please. Gary Ekland. And I'll try to be brief, but I want to speak in opposition to this. Talked about this before. People at minimum wage, they live in the market economy, the free enterprise system. Everyone that knows the major employer here is a branch of government. The other major employers are branches of government. Very few people seem to really live in the free market, but you hear about it all the time. I just heard her say, essentially, as I understood it, and I know that people are going to argue otherwise, and I would not be surprised if this doesn't go through with a ten to zero vote, as did the tax for Amazon. I understand, but this is $160 million giveaway from the city to people who are already rich. I imagine it's a large corporation of some kind, and let's say they already have a billion dollars or $100 million. All they want from Davenport is $160 million of our money. And undoubtedly 328 acres is either farmland, our wildlife habitat, and as we've talked about, the monarchs are on the way to extinction, thanks to our destruction of their habitat and our poisoning of their food. So the destruction of another 328 acres of prime farmland, our prime wildlife habitat, in the city of Davenport, with $160 million of tax money, seems like a very bad idea. And that's not counting however much money state is now there are small business people in Mister Kelly's ward, probably in every single ward of the city where people have started a small business and they may go bankrupt this year, or maybe they'll be successful. You hope every small business is successful. But if there is a small business and they're not getting property tax incentives, and they're not getting city cash and they're not getting state cash, then those small business people live in the real world, in the free market economy, and they live or die. Those people already pay extra city taxes to support Jeff Bezos buying the world's largest yacht. And I don't see why any small business person on Harrison street between here and Locust, who's paying all of their money, hoping that they succeed in their business and don't go homeless, but they actually make some money. Why they should have to pay extra taxes to support Amazon or this company, it's outrageous. I really, honestly and sincerely believe that if all of the people in the community and economic development department who figure out how to gi", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Orville J.

Why they should have to pay extra taxes to support Amazon or this company, it's outrageous. I really, honestly and sincerely believe that if all of the people in the community and economic development department who figure out how to give away money and tax increment, finance this and give away that, if all of those people had never had this city jobs beginning in 1970, the city of Davenport's economy would be in a better place than it is right now. This is more sprawl development and more tax money. I could turn around and look at any person in the office and say, why should they have to open their billfold and give away money from their billfold to people who already have more money than they ever will? How you can tell people who work at minimum wage in the city of Davenport, Iowa, that they have to live in poverty and work more hours than city workers do because we live in a free market economy. And then the city's 1015 2020, $5,000 a month, people come in and say, we just want to give them $160 million of city money and some more money from the state. This is just ridiculous. Thank you. Is there anyone else from the public here to comment on this item? All right, seeing no one, we will go to council with questions. I'll start with alderman Kelly. Thank you so much. If I could just. The young lady, where is this located? Because I want to see who's affected as far as the tax dollars that you're talking about being distributed back out into the community. So I just wanted to know that Lindale, Iowa American recently built their new facility, northern Davenport. It's near our eastern Iowa industrial Center. It's adjacent to the eastern Iowa industrial Center. Thank you, Brian. Or whoever did that no, I'm familiar with Davenport, but I don't go out there, so I'll be tootling that way just so I can make myself familiar with what's going on. So who's going to be affected? Because there's a lot of things that have come to Davenport that Davenport isn't getting tax dollars back for. And I'm just going to say it, you know, we're bringing things in, but we're not getting the effects of the trickle down with the money. So you're saying that. I was trying to take notes when you were saying that the tax dollars that will be coming back into the city. So is that directly into the city of Davenport? Yes. Based upon the estimated assessed valuation, the city would be taking in about $2.5 million annually from the project once it starts. Okay. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Any other questions, comments from council? Okay. I would just say I'm, you know, support the submission for this application. Obviously, we're early on in this conversation with the developer, but when you look at the scope of the development with the $420 million assessed valuation, when you put that into perspective, that is more than Kraft, sterilite, Amazon, and all of the big development deals we've done in recent years, which were all kind of historic for us, it's. It's bigger than all of them combined. So the tax revenue that it would bring in on an annual basis would really be significant. So total wrapped up going to the city, county, school district, five point five point four million dollars, roughly in year one. And then in year 20, $113.4 million. Davenport share that in year one would be 2.0, and in year 21 would be 6.3 million. So on a $240 million budget, it is a significant increase on an annual basis. So seeing no other comments, we are going to ask alderman Reiners to please set our agenda. Thank you, alderman. I make a motion to place items one, two, and three on the consent agenda. Second. All in favor? There's a motion? There's a motion in a second. All in favor? Aye. Are there any opposed? Sorry. Sorry, Alderman Newton. Are there any opposed? All right, our agenda has been set. Thank you. Thank you, Alderman Gripen. Alderman Reinert's next series, public Safety. Alderman Joshin. Alderman Tim Dunn will discuss. Alderman Joshin, please. Thank you, mister mayor.

Item number one is the third consideration of an ordinance amending section 13.16.060 entitled Local Limits for specific pollutants of the Municipal Code of Davenport, Iowa, to revise local discharge limits for specific pollutants. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Gary Eklin I got pointed, ordered a little bit ago when I mentioned specific pollutants that were illegally put into the waste stream and the water stream. And I don't know if there are criminal penalties or civil penalties for violating this, but I want to say that if there are laws that apply to pollutants being put into the groundwater, they should be held public employees in the public works department or any other department, the police department, if they violate the laws pouring specific pollutants into the water stream, they should be held criminally liable like anybody else. If there are laws, they should not just apply to poor people, they should apply to government people. And there are people who should be arrested for illegal dumping who are on the city's payroll. Thank you. Anyone else? Eric Cornett, 7th ward just for clarification, are these to bring the, to correct the standards that the state put out? Our standards were wrong, were printed wrong? I don't believe they were printed wrong. I think they've been changed, but I will have staff address that. Okay. Because in the new ones that we discussed a couple of weeks ago, there was a serious increase in heavy metals and arsenic. Yeah, arsenic. And, you know, that has to be treated before any, any arsenic goes into the sanitary sewer or the sewer system. So I just want to make sure that that gets done before it goes into the water. Thank you. Anyone else? Before I move on to council, we have somebody from staff that can address that. I know we did that a couple weeks ago, but. Brian Shad, public works typically these local limits are updated every five years along with our npds permit. This past the last update, we were given an incorrect spreadsheet from the Iowa DNR. It did have errors in the calculation. They provided us with the new updated spreadsheet. That's how we got these numbers. And they were agreed upon with the DNR. Thank you, council. Seeing none this item, we'll move on. Item number two is a resolution awarding a contract for the West Central Park Avenue division and Marquette street intersection improvements projects to cart the improvement in the amount of $929,459.70. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Gary Eckland of in Davenport. I apologize for speaking to this, but I feel like I must. People heard me recently say that I object to the makeup of the selection committee for the next city administrator, Mister Eckland I'm addressing this. I will. I will. This is an award going to a particular company. And I don't want to mention their names. I'm assuming that they are all honest and decent and sincere people.

Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Gary Eckland of in Davenport. I apologize for speaking to this, but I feel like I must. People heard me recently say that I object to the makeup of the selection committee for the next city administrator, Mister Eckland I'm addressing this. I will. I will. This is an award going to a particular company. And I don't want to mention their names. I'm assuming that they are all honest and decent and sincere people. But I don't believe that a company that is getting $929,000 of money from the city. That also receives millions of dollars from St. Ambrose, even though a family member is a board member. And it's listed under the IR's 990s, as a conflict of interest. I do not believe that a company that is receiving almost a million dollars right here. Should have a board member person sitting on the selection committee for the next city administrator. Because that's a conflict of interest. Assuming that the person is honest and sincere and decent. Does not change the obvious conflict of interest in receiving $6 million from St. Ambrose. For construction or demolition of housing, or whatever else they're getting. Are for getting a million dollars just in this one single project. And again, I'm not alleging any impropriety by the company or by the person. But there is rules regarding conflicts of interests. That don't say that a person is corrupt, but say that there's a conflict of interest. And therefore they should not be in that position. So I'm suggesting that either this should be denied. Or the person that I'm referring to should remove themselves voluntarily. Or be involuntarily removed from the next city administrator's selection. It's too big a conflict of interest to receive $929,000 in one contract. And who knows what contract they'll get next week? Another million dollars? 2 million? $510 million? That's a conflict of interest. And they shouldn't simultaneously be getting city money. And then be in an alliance with the people who vote in favor of this, obviously, and then be selecting the next city administrator. The conflict of interest is obvious and should be addressed by the person either voluntarily removing themselves or by the mayor resigning. And a new mayor pointing the next one. Before we go any further, can we have staff run us through how our bidding process actually works? And this did go through a bidding process. And folks that do have conflicts of interest do have to disclose that just to clear that up. That is correct, Alderman Dunn. Thank you. Anyone else? Anyone from council? Alderman McGinnis. I would refer to the mayor. Refer the mayor. But this gentleman seemed to be saying there was someone connected with bush on the selection committee for the city administrator. That is complete falsehood. Incorrect. There is nobody from that company who is involved at all. So I don't understand where the information is coming from, but it's absolutely incorrect. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else seeing on this item? We'll move on. Item number three is a resolution approving the plan specification, form of contract and estimated cost for the Emerald Drive reconstruction project. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Council seeing none. This item will move on. Item number four is the resolution approving the plan specification form, a contract and estimated costs for the East Locust Street Grand Avenue to Eastern Avenue resurfacing project. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Council seeing none. This item will move on. Item number five is the resolution approving the plan specification form, a contract and estimated cost for the water pollution control plant and compost facility, flood mitigation, stormwater and a fluid pumping system project. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Council seeing on this item. We'll move on. Item number six is a resolution authorizing the submission of an application to the United States Department of Transportation safe streets and roads for all grant program for the assistance to improve transportation safety throughout the city. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Gary Cornell, 7th Ward. I feel that the 7th ward is not represented in that application. Thank you. Anyone else? Alderman Grimm. Thank you, Alderman Dunn. Mister Merritt, I hate to put you on the spot, but I think it would be good to have you come up for this. And we've got some folks from the cycling community here, so I think it's always good to kind of share some information on what we're going after to try to improve safety. And my first question before you kind of get into what this application is, is have we applied for this money before? So, Clay, merit engineering and capital projects. So we have applied for this specific grant before. I believe we've tried twice already. However, this application is different. The other one was more tied to the Goose Creek trail corridor. However, we've been able to get grants through another avenue for those particular projects. So in this case, we have kind of reconfigured what we're looking for. And this particular grant program is centered on trying to make safe crossings, or both for multimodal transportation and vehicular transportation on corridors specific to the state highway system. So North Brady, or, excuse me, Brady street in general, is heavily focused in on here as well as west Kimberly. Great. Thank you. That's all I have. Anyone else seeing? None. This item will move on.

Is there anyone the public wishing to address this item? Council seeing on this item. We'll move on. And item number eight is a motion awarding a five year contract for transit. Transit advertising sales to hawk transit advertising of Shoreview, Minnesota. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Council seeing none. This item will move on. And Alderman Kelly, would you cite the agenda for us, please? I'd like to make a motion to move all eight items to the consent agenda. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Aye. Any opposed? Same sign and the agenda is set. And back to you, your honor. Thank you. Alderman Rick Dunn and Alderman Kelly. The next area, and last area is finance. Alderwoman Newton and Alderwoman lynch will discuss. And I understand Alderwoman lynch will lead. Alderwoman lynch, please. Thank you, mister mayor. Tonight we have two items on the finance agenda. One is resolution to fix meeting date for hearing on the issuance of not to exceed $31 million general obligation corporate bonds, series 2025. Does anybody from the public have comment on this? Derek Cornet, 7th Ward, the year 2021. The fiscal year for 2025 starts in June. End of June, I think. Yeah. Okay. And so this is another $31 million on top of the 27 that we just did. Bonds that we just did a few months, a few weeks ago, or are these bonds going to be sold next year around April? So this 31 million is not going to be added on to the already 200 million that we owe on bond debt. Okay? Right. Thank you. Anyone else? Please take in the bond sale, which is a debt. It reads in the bond sale that we have to list all of our litigations, all of the lawsuits the city is in, and the lawsuits the city is in cannot exceed, I believe, if I read it correctly, the amount of debt we are incurring as a city. And so that's where my questions lie, is with our pending, and they're ours as a city as a whole. There are people named in them, but as a whole, they belong to the city. And I believe right now, our litigations far exceed the amounts of these general obligation debts. So I'm just not positive, based on the reading I've done regarding litigations, that you will be able to move forward on this extra $31 million for 2025. So I don't know if anybody can speak to that for me to make sure I'm understanding that correctly, because, oh, I don't think I have enough fingers for the lawsuits the city has right now. And I think there's one that's estimated at like 55,000,001 asking for 2 million to come back from the settlement and the HR issues. So there's just a lot of money. So if anybody could answer that for me, I appreciate it tremendously. Thank you. Anyone else at this time, I would like to ask Miss Merritt to perhaps answer that question. Sure. Thank you. Alderwoman lynch. Yes, I can address the first question. So this is just to fix the meeting date so that we can do our IR's declaration, which is required. This is for the FY 25 bond sale. Which will not occur until sometime next year. Late winter or early spring. As determined by our financial advisor and our bond council. So they work together to set the actual date of the sale. Once we get closer to the time of year in which the bonds will be sold. So that will be more information forthcoming sometime next year in 25. Secondly, as just stated, this is just to make our declaration of what we intend to sale. Once we actually get closer to the sale date, we will prepare a preliminary official statement which will come before the council. And in that preliminary official statement, that's where we will list out any litigation, anything like that. That's reviewed by both our bond counsel and our financial advisor. And so that will again be forthcoming sometime next year. This is just the first step. It's the declaration. Our bond council has reviewed this. Dorsey and Whitney serves in that role. And they do not have any concerns. Thank you. As for the litigation question and that price not being able to supersede the bond amount, is that true? Does. Mister gentleman. I apologize. I don't know your name. Richard Davidson. Landon Waterman. No, that is not correct. The amount of the bonds are not limited by any matter involving pending litigation. Thank you. At this time, if no one else from the public has comment, anyone from council seeing none, we'll move on to item number two. Motion awarding a contract for repairs to fire truck t. Three to legacy fire apparatus of shorewood, Illinois. And an amount not to exceed $75,000. Does anyone from the public have any comments on this item? Anyone from council seeing none, this item will move on. Alderman Tim Dunn, can you please set the agenda? I'd like to make a motion to put items one and two on the finance consent agenda. Thank you.

You will have five minutes, and I do ask that everyone observe, and I know you will, the commonly accepted rules of decorum, dignity, courtesy, and good taste. Thank you very much, Miss Merritt. Is there a city administrator update this evening? Nothing tonight, madam pro tem. All right. Thank you. And we don't have any public hearings this evening, so we will move now to petitions and communications. Council members in this office, anyone have anything for tonight? The only thing I would mention is that. Just a reminder that. I'm sorry, Alderman Kelly, I'll go back to you, okay? The Easter egg hunt on Saturday, 11:00 a.m. at Vanderveer park. This is our annual Easter egg hunt. Fun for all kids of all ages. So please join us if you can. And now, Alderman Kelly. Thank you. I appreciate it. I just want to say a few really quick things. I want to tell you why Tim Kelly ran for alderman, and so why I'm sitting here on this panel. I ran for Alderman maybe six years ago, and I lost because there were a bunch of people that were scared of me, and I don't know why they were scared of me. Didn't know, didn't care. Now I see why. And I ran with the understanding I was here to help my city, first and foremost, my ward, to help my city. So I want to say that my city, my city, my city. And I didn't write anything down because I think it's crazy when people sit up here and read those Easter speeches. So this is really coming off the top of my head. So I just have a few bullet points that I want to touch that I ran because I wanted to make a difference. And with that being said, it's funny to me how many people are now being put in the situation that Tim Kelly was put in without an investigation on Tim Kelly. So it's really interesting to me that when you try to make a difference, put baby in the corner. So since baby is not alone in the corner, I welcome this new counsel. It's kind of interesting. I'm still got my eye on everybody, but I just welcome this new counsel because for years, you guys thought I was crazy, that I said I'm in the no position, but I don't know nothing. And then it was lovely when somebody wrote an email. We excluded alderman Kelly so I could share from the rooftops, because guess what? That was a proof in the pudding that I didn't know nothing. So with that being said, I want to say that the bullying that I have witnessed to some of these new people. Hold your wigs. Holy sh. Because I'm not understanding. I get it when it came to me. But the bullying that I'm seeing on the levels that you guys want us to worry about these employees, what about us elected officials that have to go through this stuff? Do you know my phone rings? I have to turn it off. Why are you calling your alderman at midnight? At midnight, you need to dial 911. Ain't nothing I can do for you at midnight. I'll holler at you tomorrow. So what I'm not understanding is protect. No offense, peanut gallery. Protect them. Screw us. Are you kidding me? I wouldn't have thrown my life away for me to be put in front of harm's way for things that I thought I was doing right. So I just have to say that I really have to end with that. And on the 28th of this month, it will be the night out with the aldermen. I will be at 1517 Harrison street and the boutique of 563 vintage.

So I'm trying to spotlight different businesses in my area. So if you have nothing going on, stop out and support these young men and have a chat with the alderman. Thank you. Thank you. Alderman Kelly. Alderman Reinarts. Thank you. I just want to make an announcement that the 8th ward, we'll be having a meeting at the library on March 14, Thursday. So come one, come all. Looking forward to talking and hearing what you have to tell me. So look forward to seeing folks six to 730, seeing no one else. We'll move ahead with our committees. And the first area we have, we have four areas discussion tonight, community development, public safety, public works and finance. Our first area for discussion is community development. Alderman Reinarts will lead the discussion and aldermen are done. We'll set the agenda. Alderman Reinarts, please. Thank you very much. I've got six items that we're going to address this evening. The first one being the second consideration ordinance for case Ord 240. One, amending chapter 17 of the municipal code of Davenport, Iowa, entitled zoning by amending Table 170, use matrix to allow bed and breakfast and a reception family as a special use in the CT commercial transitional zoning district. Anybody from the public wish to comment? Anybody from council? Moving on. The second item is second consideration ordinance for case Row 240. One being the request of the city of Davenport to vacate a portion of unimproved Marquette street right of way located south of West 76th Street, Ward eight. Anyone from the public wishing to comment? Gary Eklin. And I live in Devonport and I really, I only read what I don't get, the green sheets and I'm not an online person, and so I wish that the city staff would include a little bit more information on this. I'm not necessarily opposed to it, but I'm not sure what it's about. It just says vacated. And I can't speak in favor or against it since it's. Since there's no explanation whatsoever in these sheets that the public are. And as I mentioned in one other comment recently, I know from talking to alder people over the years that not every alder person gets an opportunity to read the green sheets from COVID to cover. I don't even know if you print them out anymore or if you just go online, but they used to have a big thick stack and sometimes it'd be two inches thick. And there's lots of detail in there. If you read it from COVID to cover, you learn a lot but some aldermen, not just public people, but some aldermen end up reading these as a source of information. And I wish there was a little bit of information because I don't even know whether I'm opposed to it. I really don't understand what it's about. Thank you. Anyone else? Counsel, moving on. Item three, second consideration ordinance for case Reza 240. One being the request of the city of Davenport to rezone approximately 31.9 acres of land at 2800 Eastern Avenue from s. One c institutional campus district to CT commercial transitional district and establish a planned unit development in accordance with the submitted preliminary plat. Ward five. Anybody from the public wish to speak? Gary Eklin, I believe this is Annie Wittenmeyer again, and I apologize for getting up here. I'll be very fast. I believe that the city should still, I really don't even believe it's too late. The city should carve out the theater and at least two cottages for the theater so that the disruption, completely and totally unnecessary. Disruption to junior theater, completely and totally unnecessary. And I believe it would work even if they carved out two cottages and the theater. Thank you. Anybody from council? Moving on. Item number four, resolution approving case f 23 ten being the request of quick Trip Corporation for a final plat of business commons at Silver Creek. Second edition. A one lot subdivision on 3.82 acres located south of West 76th street and west of Northwest Boulevard, ward eight. Anybody from the public wish to comment? Council? Item number five, resolution approving case f 20 315, the request of 227 Leclaire LLC for final plant of Riverwatch Subdivision, a two lot subdivision on 2.42 acres located at 227 Leclaire street, third ward. Anybody from the public wish to comment? Council. And the last item, resolution approving case f 20 316, being the request of quick Trip Corporation for final plat of Interstate park. Fourth edition. A one lot subdivision on 5.02 acres located at 2904 West 76th Street, Ward two. Anybody from the public wish to comment? Council. Thank you. I wish for aldermen are done to set the agenda, please. Thank you. I make a motion to place all items on the consent agenda, please. I have a motion and a second. All in favor? Aye. Opposed? Back to you. Thank you very much.

Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Council seeing none. This item we'll move on. Item number two is the resolution adopting the most recent published editions of the Iowa Statewide urban design standards for public improvements, the Iowa statewide urban standards specification and public improvements, and the city of Davenport's supplemental specifications for public improvements and the city of Davenport's supplemental specification manual. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Sorry, not a good day. A very small, minor thing that I found after deep search why people do not want to move to Davenport. Oh, David Anderson award five, border award three. I'm calling attention to the subpage backup material hypertext from the agenda. Page one of two thus says show page. Oh, that's what I'm supposed to do. Not a good day. This is not mentioned in the expanded version. Under another hypertext of backup material. 70 33.0 c state's deleted requirement to stamp driveways and sidewalks with information identifying contractor. So will the date be stamped? I frequently visit new homes and additions ranging over $200,000. In Davenport, I get around a lot. Many sidewalks have needed replaced immediately. I mean, these people bought brand new, huge, expensive houses and had to replace all the concrete if it doesn't immediately need it. I've seen cracks, pits, disintegration, unlevel sidewalks. This is scary to me. I, you know, it's an embarrassment to Davenport, and I was just hoping that at least they would stamp their name and date on it because I'm just a small person that doesn't see everything, and I see huge amounts of this myself personally. And like I say, it's buried information. But I dig severely, deeply, and I do know how to get almost every single thing. This is one of the largest agendas. I couldn't get it all this week, but I do my due diligence. Thank you for listening. Thank you. Anyone else sign them?

So will the date be stamped? I frequently visit new homes and additions ranging over $200,000. In Davenport, I get around a lot. Many sidewalks have needed replaced immediately. I mean, these people bought brand new, huge, expensive houses and had to replace all the concrete if it doesn't immediately need it. I've seen cracks, pits, disintegration, unlevel sidewalks. This is scary to me. I, you know, it's an embarrassment to Davenport, and I was just hoping that at least they would stamp their name and date on it because I'm just a small person that doesn't see everything, and I see huge amounts of this myself personally. And like I say, it's buried information. But I dig severely, deeply, and I do know how to get almost every single thing. This is one of the largest agendas. I couldn't get it all this week, but I do my due diligence. Thank you for listening. Thank you. Anyone else sign them? Before I move to council, can we have the city engineer come up and explain what the Sudos manual and all that is about and why we're making these changes? Brian ShaDd, city engineer just as a quick overview, this is a statewide standard. I gave a short presentation on it before. A lot of municipalities dot Iowa State and suppliers all put their information in for this. So there's a good backing on a lot of technical knowledge. This particular item, we actually removed the stamp that typically goes in sidewalks because we have our cartograph work order system and our permits. So we're able to track who put that sidewalk, and we're actually saving a little bit of money for the contractors. Thank you. Before I move on, anyone from council, I'm sorry, if I could ask just, I think to reiterate this, so the stamps not there because it's now available on cartographs. So this is easily available information then to a new homeowner. They would be able to call and find out the date of their. Or they go online to do that. Absolutely. They could work with public works. We'd be able to look that up. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else? Yes, thank you. Just for a quick reference. I'm so sorry you come back up here. Just for some folks that don't know, can you briefly describe or explain what cartograph is? Cartograph is our work order management asset management system. We've been working for several years to put in quite a bit of information. We can track our own workforce hours, material, etcetera. With that. We can track our permits with it, be it building or right of way permits. It's really just kind of an all encompassing data tool for public works. Thank you. Anyone else seeing none decide. Move on. Item number three is a resolution accepting the work completed under the FY 2021 2022 Sewer Manhole rehabilitation program by Langman Construction in the amount of $2,613,640.10. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Council seeing on this item, we'll move on. Item number four is a resolution awarding contracts for the 2024 sewer lateral repair program totaling $970,000 to six contractors and authorizing the public works director, assistant city administrator to increase quantities for each contract within the capital improvement project budget constraints. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? I wasn't looking up, so I'm not sure who's doing this one. Is that you, mister? Okay. This is for the sewer, and I'll be very, very, very brief. And I told myself when I came down here that if I was going to come down here, I was going to get up and address the sewers when they came up. And I'll only address it once, but the sewer bill should really be shifted back into the property tax the way that it used to be because it has an excessively negative effect on poor home owners and poor minimum wage type renters. And the city at one point had the garbage and sewer bill included in the property taxes. And then at one point, in order to be able to have more money and an extraordinarily wasteful move in terms of staff and postage and all of that other stuff. The sewer bill should be moved back onto the property tax that has to do with the sewers. And I'll get down and I'll only comment once tonight on the sewers, but the sewers. If the. If the city council is at all concerned about affordability for minimum wage workers and other people, they'll move this back onto the property taxes the way it used to be. Thank you. Anyone else? Anyone from council seeking on this item? We'll move on. Item number five has a resolution awarding a contract for the CY 2024 sidewalk program to c two.

Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? Council Alderman Kelly. Anyone from council seeing none. Item, we'll move on. And now, Alderman Kelly, would you set the agenda for us, please? Thank you, Sarah. I would like to make a motion that set all eleven items to the consent agenda. Second. We have a motion in a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Same sign. That sets the agenda. And back to you, mayor pro town. Thank you. Alderman Kelly and Alderman Dunn, our final area to be discussed in finance. And Alderman Newton will lead this discussion. Discussion. And Alderman Lynch. Alderwoman lynch will set the agenda. Before I yield the Florida finance chair, Alderman Newton, I want to remind my colleagues that the first two items on the finance agenda involve municipal employees who have not waived their rights under Iowa code section 21.51. I. So any discussion or commentary council members may have regarding these two agenda items should only occur during a closed session. For us to engage in discussion of those two items on the floor of a public meeting and violate the employee's rights. And with that, I recognize alderman. Alderman Newton. Alderman Newton. Thank you, Madam Prov tem. Alderman. Woman lynch and I have five items on the finance agenda for tonight. The first item is a resolution ratifying executive order 23 22, appointing Mallory Merritt as interim city administrator, ratifying personal memorandum of understanding between the city of Davenport and Mallory Merritt, memorizing Miss Merritt's appointment as interim city administrator and approving amendment one to the personal memorandum of understanding between the city of Davenport and Mallory Merritt. Is there anyone from the public wishing to address this item? I would ask that you please come forward, state your name, address and reward. My name is Latrice Lacy and I live in the fifth ward. I would like to first co sign the statement that Alderman Kelly made regarding the disrespect that some of the new council members have experienced. I would also like to point out that the section of the open meetings law that was cited specifically says that council does not have to honor the employee's request to discuss it in closed session. So this is something that is your right to do, and you can't do it in closed session, but if you don't want to, you don't have to. That's what it says in the law. I would like to point out the different treatment that is given to staff seemingly based on race. There are really unending limits that there seem to be to go through to protect staff members who are white from being embarrassed, from having something negative said about them, from being criticized. You're willing to edit footage, you're willing to lie, apparently cheat, still pay people off. God knows what else. Sue Ezra. We don't know what you're willing to do. The way that this has been handled is bonkers to me and probably everybody else in this room. We cannot get staff in our office. We've been asking for years and we have not been able to get staff. But we can give someone a bonus that will cover two or three staff people, at least part time people. But we're told every year you don't have funding, but it just means that you don't care about civil rights. Law enforcement don't care about civil rights. It's the only department that really has diversity. There's no concern with it. If people are paid $50,000 bonuses with public funds, where is the limit? Where is the end? There's no efforts taken to make sure that these people are performing their duties ethically. There's no efforts taken to make sure that they are not engaging in discrimination, that they are being properly supervised and disciplined. It's just been a free for all is what we've seen. They can do whatever they want and a lot of you probably have no idea what they're doing because they present one thing to you and then they're doing something else behind the scenes. There needs to be some changes in how these things are handled. If somebody can get a $50,000 bonus, then I want one, too. Amen. My name is David Ezra Sidren. I live in the third ward.

There's no efforts taken to make sure that they are not engaging in discrimination, that they are being properly supervised and disciplined. It's just been a free for all is what we've seen. They can do whatever they want and a lot of you probably have no idea what they're doing because they present one thing to you and then they're doing something else behind the scenes. There needs to be some changes in how these things are handled. If somebody can get a $50,000 bonus, then I want one, too. Amen. My name is David Ezra Sidren. I live in the third ward. On November 8, 2023, the mayor signed this this executive order appointing misses Merritt as interim city administrator and with the attached memorandum of understanding included a $50,000 bonus. You've probably heard that the city of Davenport has a weak mayor strong council form of government. This is true. The mayor can issue executive orders for things like declaring World diabetes day and presumably handing out keys to the city. The mayor, however, does not have the power to hire or fire or give out $50,000 bonuses via executive order. If the mayor could rule by executive order, there would be no need for the council at all. The mayor would sit up on the third floor signing executive orders all day, hiring people, firing people, giving bonuses, ordering cheeseburgers, whatever he wanted. It doesn't work like that. The mayor of Davenport is not a dictator. Presumably outside counsel told the city that using executive orders to give up bonuses wasn't legal. So the city next tried to hide these bonuses with closed sessions. According to the Iowa attorney general, there are four reasons and all four must be present for the city council to meet and close session. Apparently, these secret closed sessions didn't meet any of the requirements. Again, presumably outside counsel told the city that they were doing wasn't legal. So now we're at the city's third attempt to hand out $50,000 bonuses. This is the resolution that is before you now. I would remind the council that the Iowa state auditor announced that it was performing, quote, a review of millions of dollars in settlements Davenport recently made with public employees. And that, quote, the probe has to do with payouts that totaled $2 million to city administrator Corey Spiegel and two administrative assistants. The deals were made in secret and disclosed only after they had been signed. Presumably misses Merritt, as the city's chief financial officer, was involved with these payouts. Presumably the city's chief financial officer is cooperating with the state auditor's investigation. I respectfully submit that until the state auditor submits his final report that no more outrageous bonuses and payouts be approved for city employees. I strongly urge the city council to vote down this absurd giveaway of more city funds. I remind the council that Davenport has a weak mayor, strong council form of government, and it's time for the council to be strong, show some backbone, do the right thing and vote this giveaway down. Thank you. Thank you. Next, please state your name, address or award. Judith Lee, second ward here we go again. I believe the same violation of open meeting laws and misuse of executive sessions and violation of state law to keep agreements and decisions out of full council and public view. I believe that there's mayoral overreach in using executive orders for installation of the interim CA and acting Corporation counsel without counsel or public review discussion and decision making, including the executive order unilaterally installing merit as the interim CA position being signed by the mayor on November 8, one day after the election, the legal department, the legal firm that shall not be named and the mayor, and to some unknown degree, the committee, the corporation, city administrator and interim city administration again began making agreements behind closed doors for council to ratify an after the fact ratification. Someone in the law firm that shall not be named realizes again there should at least be a sham attempt at public disclosure and decision making through ratification by the council. Ratification is when the decision has already been made and implemented without compliance with council authority, open meeting law, Iowa code, chapter 21 and public involvement and disclosure, again using executive sessions to try to force council members to not publicly disclose actions discussed and taken in executive session when those actions and discussions should be disclosed under Iowa open meeting law. Despite what you just said, for an executive session relating to personnel actions, the following four criteria must occur. The decision must evolve an evaluation of the professional competency of an individual. The discussion must involve consideration of the appointment, hiring, performance, or discharge of the individual. The discussion must be such that if conducted during an open meeting, it would cause needless and irreparable injury to the person's reputation, and the individual must request all four of those. I see nothing in the information provided in the background for these two items that related to needless and irreparable injury to that person's reputation. On what grounds would there need to be a closed session regarding a known entity such as merit? Why were executive sessions held three months after the unilateral executive order? Council has the authority to vote to not enter into executive session when asked by a vote of one third of the council, and I encourage you to use that authority if you feel that it is inappropriate for the discussion that's going to be happening for it to happen in closed discussion why was the RFP for the search company issued on February 12, knowing before the election in October 23 that Spiegel was being paid with the contracting date of the search company April 24, 2024, inherently guarantee", "answer_v2": "[\n    {\n        \"name\": \"City of Davenport\",\n        \"positives\": [],\n        \"negatives\": [\n            \"engaging in illegal executive orders to give out bonuses\",\n            \"conducting secret closed sessions that did not meet legal requirements\",\n            \"involvement in payouts that are being investigated by the state auditor\",\n            \"violating Iowa open meeting law\",\n            \"mayoral overreach in unilaterally appointing interim positions\"\n        ],\n        \"decision\": \"sell\",\n        \"comment\": \"The City of Davenport has been repeatedly mentioned in a negative light for engaging in illegal activities, lack of transparency, and misuse of funds.

I was still on council November 8 23 and I knew nothing about the November 8 agreement that Alderman Jobjin grip done JJ Condon Mayor pro Tem McGinnis affirmed, as it says, along with the former guy corporation council and mayor Matson, which is not even a majority of the council. Did these aldermen realize their signatures were attached to a document that was developed in violation of Iowa open meeting law, section 21 and strong council weak mayor form of government for Davenport, undermining the authority and cohesiveness of council and putting their professional and legal integrity at risk. In conclusion, it appears the city's managed by a mayor way overreaching his authority and knowingly doing it in the dark out of the public eye, a legal department that is rude to counsel and constantly practices dereliction of duty, as evidenced by the unprofessional outburst and refusal to provide legal advice when requested by the alderman at large last week by the current guy in that chair, a law firm that is not to be named, that is taking action behind closed doors and providing too much after the fact advice, including advising that the former guy in that chair clean out his desk and leave weeks before retirement and that council make sham decisions to cover the city's violations and lack of good faith, using the council old guard who are known to be predictable supporters of whatever the mayor, legal department and staff want to do, which works to keep the rest of the council and the public in the dark. Expecting council to cover for inappropriate and probably illegal violations of state code 21 through silence and after the fact ratification. What's it going to take to get this city back working together openly and to its proper authorities, this council, as the governing body of this city, with staff and mayors serving in their appropriate roles, in order to be a functioning and open, transparent government of the people, vital people. Thank you, Miss Lee. I would ask anyone else wishing to speak on this item, please step up to the podium. State your name and your either address or award. Mary Johansson, first award. It came to my attention that $50,000 award was going to be given to individuals. It came to $100,000 that y'all are going to give out. I think it's inappropriate at this time when we're being audited by the state for misappropriation, possible misappropriation of funds. It's disturbing. I'd rather be home reading a book than being down here. I'm reading this too often. I wish that everybody would decide to do their proper job. I don't know if the tail is wagging the dog hair or the dog is wagging the tail, and I don't know if you know what that means. I don't know if the city administration is telling you what to do. We didn't vote them in. We voted you all in to represent us. You don't get paid as much as they do. From what I've seen from the quasity times, they get outrageous salaries for what they do as assistant city administrators. We had two before the city administrator left, so I think there's significant or sufficient people to do the job. They don't need a bonus of $50,000. I am from the first board, blue collar, west end of town. $50,000 would take care of a whole year for four people. Family to six people, family. To me, that's a lot of money. But to somebody that's making already 250,000 a year, I think it's outrageous. And I really believe that the city should stop expending these funds until the state auditor is done finding out what has been done with the rest of it. Money. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else? Hi, my name is Gary Ekman. I live in Mister Kelly's wardrobe. I only heard this yesterday and wasn't really planning on speaking and I am not really sure anymore which. There's two assistant administrators. And one of them, I know, was previously a human resources director. And I know one of them either currently or does supervise the neighborhood department. And I'm not sure whether that's her or not. But even if it's not, I'm opposed to her being ratified. Even more so if she was the human resources director. Because I believe the current human resources director should be fired immediately. And the racial demographics in the city of Davenport are essentially. The city of Davenport is essentially 50% white, 50% black, dark skinned, hispanic, asian, mixed race, and a couple of Native Americans who the legal department hasn't deported yet. You have heard me talk about the destruction of my blueberries and. And also my milkweed. And one of the things I know I haven't talked about, Mister Eklund, is please stick to the agenda.

The city of Davenport is essentially 50% white, 50% black, dark skinned, hispanic, asian, mixed race, and a couple of Native Americans who the legal department hasn't deported yet. You have heard me talk about the destruction of my blueberries and. And also my milkweed. And one of the things I know I haven't talked about, Mister Eklund, is please stick to the agenda. Well, I would like to know what role this woman played in a three year long campaign against me that began Easter Sunday, a couple days after Easter Sunday in 2021. The city of Davenport, with the administrator. Please stick to the agenda item which is the ratification of an executive order. The ratification of a personal memory, but it's the agreement to put in place, in permanent place, a woman whose job qualifications I'm calling into question. Based upon the city's performance under her review, she had a supervisory responsibility for city employees and city employees. Point of order. We have to take a vote. I'm calling a point of order. The person who's. Whose agreement is being discussed has nothing to do with this gentleman's concern. I understand he has long term concerns about what happened, but this. He's misidentifying the person who. This person had no responsibility in that area. So sorry. I am not sure that I haven't had time to ask whether she was human resources director or whether she was the supervisor of the neighborhood department. I believe the supervisor of the neighborhood department is clearly not. But I also believe that all of the people at the top of the city government are implicated. I would like to know. Latrice Lacy just came up here. I don't know who ordered the action against her regarding stuff to do in her yard. I believe it might very well have been from somebody who targeted her. And I think. Gary. Okay. Yeah, I apologize that I only heard about this yesterday and I didn't have more time. But I have to say, I don't know who helped the mayor plan that committee to investigate the investigation that apparently they are hiding the report from. I talked to the alderman who was here before, who's not here anymore. Mister Eklund, I'm more than happy to meet with you after the meeting. If there's other things that you would like to talk about. Well, no, but these people have professional responsibility. When they. When they had the email situation last year where they said, we're gonna send emails to the seven people who are on our partisan political divide side, and we're not gonna send emails. Gary, I will meet with you. And Alderman Newton is offering, so we can all sit down with something. But this is not a personal thing with me right now. I understand that this is. This is. If the issue at hand right now is the $50,000. Well. And the ratification of permanent status. And if she was involved in the decision not to send emails to three aldermen, then she shouldn't be involved, because these staff, the legal staff is not supposed to represent seven out of ten council people. The legal staff is supposed to represent ten. If they send an email saying, we've got a proposal for the baseball stadium, it should go to all ten people, not the seven people who they consider to be their soulmates. I'm going to ask you to sit down. I will sit down. I'm 100% opposed to this. I'm going to ask you to sit down and please take advantage of the offers of these aldermen to meet with you.

Every time I read the newspaper, I roll my eyes, and I'm sure we all have been in that position where we roll our eyes with everything that's going on. At this point, I'm totally in agreement. That $50,000 bonus, and I'm sure she is more than qualified. I read her background. She went to Auburn. She's well qualified. However, how do you do two jobs? How can you be the CFO and also a city manager? How can you handle both jobs when one requires everything of your time, and then we're asking someone to do two jobs and then give them a raise to probably not be able to do either job effectively. Who came up with this? I don't understand. And the other thing is, how long have we been now looking for a new city administrator or city manager? How long have we been looking? Where are we on the search at this time? Are we going to find someone more qualified than we had before? And those are the questions that I think all of the citizens of Davenport are looking for the answer. But please, I beg of all of you, all of you do your homework. Look for a professional city manager, especially after what we've been through and what we're going to go forward with, who has the qualifications and the experience to do the job. Thank you.

But when you look@the.org chart of the city of Davenport, believe it or not, the residents are on top. We the people. Then you all are the exact same line of the attorney and the city administrator, equal, on the same level. I think there's a conflict of interest when you've got the mayor spending time in a closed door session with the city administrator agreeing with the city attorney that this is a $50,000 which doesn't have to go through quite the scrutiny of $50,001. The office is responsible for public works. That office is responsible for sanitation. That office is responsible. Everybody literally reports to that office, which means somebody in that office had to walk in and say 324 Main street. Look at 324 Main street. Look at 324 Main street. Look at three, two, four main street. And it fell on deaf ears. Corey Spiegel walked away with $1.6 million for having deaf ears. And if her people, her managers didn't bring it to her attention, then that needs to be addressed. If she's HR, she shouldn't be lateral to some of the people in this city. The setup is messed up. Setup has been messed up. Maybe if it's a performance based $50,000 and we can see the performance. But right now, what I know is she was in that office when that building fell. City clerk was let go, building official resigned. But as far as I know, that's it. What about their managers? What about people they report to? We going to pay off everybody? Common sense. We need some common sense in city hall. Feels like everybody wants to sweep everything under the rug. I say it's time to clean house and use the broom to clean city hall. A big broom. Yeah. Industrial sized broom. So needless to say, I object to just writing another check for $50,000 to someone in city administration because city administration has let down the people of Davenport. The residents of 324 Main street. State your name and address or Ward. Ma'am. Rose and Westside. I come here tonight to say her story. Her story does not qualify her for $50,000. His story don't qualify him for $50,000. You all were voted by the people of Davenport to sit in these seats. You all need to do the right thing. Instead of letting a small man like the mayor. Who is very small in stature outside of here. Coerce you into giving her and him. I'd give them 50 cent because that's what they worth. Okay, I'm gonna just say it. I want y'all to vote no against paying them who are not worth it. $50,000. You didn't even pay the poor woman who got her leg cut off over at 324 men. $50. And you talking about giving them something. They're rude, they're racist. They just want money, and they don't even need it. Give the people that needed the money, not them. Okay. And quit women. This is women's History Month. I'm gonna say it to all the women who I feel are women up here. Quit letting these men bully y'all. Because they nobody. Nobody. The mayor is nobody. Get him at home behind closed doors. I bet you he cry every night like a baby. He's small in stature. Don't be bullied. Don't be bullied by the mayor. The real women up here. Cause one of them act like a man. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else? Hi. Cassandra Forth ward. I just wanted to make a clear contrast. $50,000 would provide temporary supportive housing. Or permanent supportive housing for one person for almost four years. $50,000 would provide. Well, it's over double the average city income here. So I just wanted to make very clear that what we're funding is what we're prioritizing. Thank you. Anyone else? My name is Cody Elif. And I have worked at the city hall for almost a decade. And have held multiple positions at a time without additional compensation. For that. I am doing the jobs currently of housing analyst. Housing programs manager. And assistant director of our department. I'm expected by the finance department and the city administration. To do this without compensation for the three jobs. And I do it because the work needs to get done. It is what it is. I'm not seeing why you wouldn't hold the employees that you oversee. To the same standards and expectations. They are allowed to get bonuses. While we struggle to staff our office. And process complaints from the residents of Davenport. This is also an equal pay issue of discrimination.

Derek Cornett, 7th Ward. How's everybody doing tonight? I'm going to restate some of the things that the other people have already stated. Strong counsel, weak. Mayor, you can fire these people. Okay? You can fire them. It just takes a vote from you guys. If they're not doing their jobs, you can fire them. Yeah, I wouldn't support this 50,000 for either one of them right now. Especially not the number two item, because outside counsel does all the work for them. But I think we need to sit back and see what the bond ratings do this year. So far, since the bond rating was done last time, we've had a building collapse, multimillion dollar lawsuits pending. Probably two thirds of the senior staff administration has fled ship. And every day there's a new conspiracy going on with the mayor and his good old boys group. You know, what are they going to. I mean, what are they going to say when they come in there and look at the bond rating? Davenport's a mess. You know, we shouldn't get a good rating this year. Why? Hell, the mayor and four of the people on the council may be forced to resign for illegal actions. And they deserve to be forced to resign. Yeah, they do. Because you did it. You did it behind closed doors, and you knew it. And you listened to those idiots over here tell you. Yeah, point of order. Come on, say it. You know, you got to sit down and think about this stuff. You guys, the council people, sit and think about this stuff. You don't have to go into a closed session tonight. You don't have to vote on this to ratify this stuff. You know, just say, vote tonight, and say, we don't want a closed session, and then you won't have one. And don't ratify the $50,000. You know, I mean, hey, I'd wait and see what. How the city's gonna do on their bond issue this year before I'd give finance $50,000. Thank you. Please state your name and address your warden. Seven board. I honestly feel bad for. For some of you new people sitting up here. Have to listen to this mess. It has to be kind of scary. You only been here in your seats for a couple months, and it's so convenient that Mayor Madison is not here. I don't know where he is. I don't know if he's sick. Please, God, don't let him be sick if that's not the reason. I feel bad for him, but it's convenient that he's not here to point an order. And you know how he nods his head at people and, you know, throws his signal. So, I don't know. He be holding some of your hand, but I would like to say piggyback off what he said. 2023. Davenport got a big old fat, fat f. Failed. So nobody should be getting a raise. If I work and if I don't do my job appropriately, I don't get no bonus. I don't get no raise. I don't get an extra quarter, an extra dollar, nothing. Okay, so the same thing applies here. A bad year. No. No bonuses, no raises, not nothing. Maybe next year. That's what they tell us. Regular people. The same applies to y'all. Is there anyone else wishing to speak on this item? Is there anyone from council wishing to speak on this item? Seeing none. Oh, I'm sorry. Alderwoman lynch. Thank you. I just. Mister Heyer, can you clarify, please? We are not allowed to speak on this item, though. Is that correct? Well, all I can say to that is not knowing what you intend to say, you need to be very cautious because the employees involved have not waived their rights. It's an employment issue. Thank you. This is quite the predicament we're in. I feel like we've heard a lot of information that I think some of us didn't know from our constituents. I personally don't know what's true and what's not. So I do want to clarify that and thank you for your feedback. And I guess I just really want to say, please rest assured that we did not run for office to be bullied or told what to do. We are strong minded people, and we're independent thinkers. So please understand that and bear with us. Thank you. Thank you. Alderwoman lynch, alderman Kelly, thank you for my chance to speak again. So I'm gonna run that back. Bullying, bullying. Bullying. I know what to say, and I know what not to say. I'm happy that I wasn't involved. How about them apples? Is there anyone else from council wishing to speak? Okay. Seeing none, we will move on to the next item. I will recommend that items one and two, however, go on for discussion to allow the council time to understand these items and possibly make a statement next week. Item number two.

Is there anyone from the public wishing to speak on this item? Please? Step four. State your name and either address or ward. James Woods. 8th word. First of all, I would like. As the citizens of Davenport, I'd like to apologize to you, Miss Newton, because you were treated with total disrespect last week, and I was not here to be able to say anything. Second of all is when does the money stop? You know, we sat, and a lot of us sat in an election thing saying that all the money's accounted for. All the money's accounted for. We pulled $4 million out. You told us 3 million. It was actually $4 million. For 324. We pulled 1.6 million out. And to answer Latrice's question, that's where it stops. 1.6 million. When does the money stop? You guys are all pretty tech savvy. I suggest you guys look on your phones tonight when you have some free time. Look up the city of Dalton, Illinois. It's 124 miles away. And guess what? It's really close to us. Money getting spent like no other. Council's getting cut out of stuff. Feds are in there investigating. State auditor is in there investigating. The auditor is not only here for three or four, the three payouts, because I was the one that helped collect 292 signatures. Only 100 were needed. And he's going to investigate the money at 324, too. So until those investigations are done, I suggest we close the checkbook and only do only mandatory things. Nothing extra, nothing more. Because we were told in October that our tax money is tapped out. All it goes. It goes to all the departments and there's no extra money. But we pulled 6 million out of our butts. This ain't DC. We don't just print them. So where's it coming from? Maybe the slush funds that were mentioned in the budget meeting. I don't know. Do the right thing. Thank you. Anyone else? And even if you spoke before, can you please still state your name and either address or word? Hi, my name is David Ezra Sidron. I live in the third ward. This is now the third attempt to give Mister Hyer a $50,000 bonus. The first try was with the mayor's executive order. In a weak mayor's strong council form of government such as the city of Davenport has, the mayor does not have the authority to do this. The legal term is ultra vires. It means acting or done beyond one's legal power or authority. The mayor of Davenport does not have the power to give out bonuses with an executive order. Apparently, outside counsel told the city this wasn't going to fly. Why didn't the city's own legal department warn the mayor first? Then the city tried to do a closed session end around again. Outside counsel told the city this wasn't legal. Why didn't the city's own legal department tell the mayor? Now the council is being asked to approve a resolution to award another $50,000 bonus. Before you give away more city money, let's take a look at the actions of the city's legal department over the last few months because of how the city's legal department handled the $1.6 million payoff to the previous city administrator. The city is being investigated by the state auditor and it's being sued. The city's legal department did not inform the mayor that his actions were ultra vires or way beyond his legal authority. The city's legal department did not inform the city that their closed sessions did not meet the legal requirements. In all of these situations, outside counsel, we know who they are. We can't say the firm's name. We know what they charge and they're charging the city a lot. Had to inform the city that their actions were not legal. And then the city's legal department, in conjunction with the outside counsel, decided to sue me because, and I'm quoting from the city's own press release here. I simply, quote, requested copies of the records in question. Let that sink in. I filed a foia and got sued. The city of Davenport is suing a citizen simply for requesting a public document. Did the city council vote on this? Aren't you guys supposed to vote on us when you sue people, or do they just run on their own? I guess they make their own decisions. You guys are superfluous. Now, finally, I'd like to remind the city council of Mister Hyer's response to Alderwoman Newton's concerns that the city might be in violation of policy pertaining to public comment at city council meetings. Mister Hyer responded, and this is an exact quote, this is not a topic appropriate for discussion on the floor of the city council meeting. Out of respect to the mayor, the city council and my responsibility to the city of Davenport as your attorney, for the time being, I'm not going to engage you in this conversation. Close quote. I am asking the city council not to reward Mister Hyer with a $50,000 bonus. I ask the city council to vote against this absurd payoff. I'm asking the city council to please do your job. Thank you.

Anyone else? Joe Shagna, third ward. I got a hold of after last week's meeting from the aldermen to my left. Resolution 2015 156 committee Finance Department legal and basically, these were the council rules saying that five minutes is what people can talk. This is what was advised to not speak out loud last week. Rule nine customary order of business 13, public with business to present to the council. Any person may address the council for no more than five minutes to discuss business relative to the City of Davenport. The following is customary order of business at the committee of the whole number ten, public with business. Any person may address the council for nor more than five minutes to discuss business with the City of Davenport. Rule twelve under duties and privileges of the mayor, the mayor shall preserve order into quorum and shall preside decide all questions of order. I think I heard a point of order regarding relevance to the item, ma'am, that this is advice from this attorney that again, behind closed door and executive session that actually goes completely against the resolution 2015 from the legal department. So if anybody should be aware of what the rules are, it is the legal department. These rules. I also want to read a quote from this person that after the collapse of the 324 building and his statement was that there are two ways to do things and no law on which way is the correct way, Heyer said, adding that bringing the agreements into public session was just to dot all the I's. So in other words, it's absolutely okay to do everything behind closed doors? We only bring it up front when we get caught because we can't sweep it under the rug. This is your legal advice moving forward? I don't trust this legal counsel. I heard tonight someone say you have the ability and you have the right and the authority to fire legal counsel. Not only do I not want you to give a bonus of $50,000, I'm asking that you fire legal counsel. It is only because of outside counsel that they advise the council about the $1.6 million payout and only probably because of legal counsel. Do we know that this $50,000 is on these? Now, my suggestion, when you close the doors, have a legal discussion. Leave one out. He's not working for the city. He's not working for the residents. His job performance is showing that if you can't see it. I'm not blind. Blind man can see it. Anyone else? Please state your name and either address or ward.

You guys are fully capable of doing this job. And I have faith. And I will tell you one thing, Miss lynch. My husband's moral compass always points straight north. Always. I can assure you of that. You have an obligation to cure the city's cancer. Hi. Anyone else? Rosa, west side. I want to. I don't want you to take offense when I say that you guys are being bullied, okay? But what I see here, I see the men of small stature bullying you guys. And I don't want you to go behind a closed door session to vote for him to get $50,000 because you're afraid of how maybe one of your constituents up here would think one of your workers. Because I didn't do it. They don't like me. Who cares? Okay? That's what I mean about being bullied. When you ran for office. Every last one of you, everybody asked for our vote. Like us, we're going to do a good job. The good job is to do what the voters want. And we no longer want to fund him or her. We tired of them. It's time for them to go. They were a big party, and they know all what happened. But now we go reward them $50,000 because they sitting ugly selves over there. And interim. No, I know what you gonna say. I know what you gonna say. I said it already. Let's be. I said it already. I said it already. I ain't taking it back. But anyway, what I saw him do to you last week was very disrespectful. And you bagged up. And I know you ain't afraid of nobody. I know that when I saw you bag up, that just. That got me nervous. Because women, we run the world. We run the world.

My previous statement regarding Miss merit stands for this item on the agenda as well. Regarding mayoral overreach, my belief that section 21 of Iowa code relating to open meeting law has again been violated using the same process as was used for the previous payouts. Council has been manipulated and suppressed, and the legal department supporting and the law firm that shall not be named, misusing the law and council authorities and use of executive sessions to keep public business from public view. In addition, I make the following comments regarding Mister Heyer and these agreements. The mayor again overreached his authority and appointing him by executive order to this position without council involvement, discussion, review, and decision making. He did it on January 2, your first day, about 50% of the council. It's clear that Mister Heyer has no respect for council authority as a whole and for individual council members and is readily open to dereliction of his duty because he would not answer a valid question asked by the finance chair, and he did it in a bullying and disrespectful manner. He's also sent me emails while I was on counsel and off that were rude, aggressive, and bullying, and I have copies if you want to see them. I ask why the city entered into a voluntary separation agreement with Mister Hyer and Mister Warner August 2022 that identified his resignation, not retirement date, as effective February 2, 2024. As initialed by both Mister Hyer and Miss Fleming, without notification or involvement of the council. I was on council at the time and I knew nothing about this agreement. And there's agreement for each of those. What does clause six in that voluntary separation agreement entitled release mean? It says the parties agree to mutually release, acquit, and forever discharge the other party from any and all liability whatsoever, including all claims, demands, and causes of action of every nature affecting either party. The parties further agree not to sue or otherwise institute any legal proceeding of any nature against the other party, with the exception of litigation to enforce this agreement, though parties agree this agreement is not an admission by the city or any other person of any acts that might be considered a violation of federal, state, or local law. That sounds to me like we're doing a. You are released from all possible problems forever. That's what I'm hearing. Why was it released, entered into a year and a half prior and not rescinded by these current agreements? What is going on with the legal department with this release? I have no idea. So I repeat. Oh, by the way, the question about when the search is going to start. The contract is supposed to be issued on April 24, 2024, which is three days before her $5,000 a month starts. That's why I said it's inherent to her agreement that she will get $5,000 extra a month. I repeat, what is it going to take to get the city council back working together openly and its proper authorities at the governing body of the city, with staff and mayors serving in their appropriate roles, in order to be a functioning, open, transparent government of the people, by the people, and for the people? At what point does Davenport no longer be a third world autocratic government that knowingly tampers with election, publicly bullies and openly suppresses individual council members, as well as council as a whole? Openly violates open meeting laws to the extent that the state legislature steps in and changes laws to make it more expensive with fines for when you knowingly violate laws, which is what the city has been doing, and also unilaterally suppressing constituents First Amendment rights to actively seek redress of grievances? At what point does David so with that, I ask to close. I encourage you all to vote no on ratification. Don't step into that legal cesspool that they have created for you. Vote no on ratification. These are previously made decisions. Vote no on the amendment until this can be openly discussed and looked at as it should be according to the purposes of executive sessions, which this does not meet. All four, and say no to going into executive session tonight. We need three to stop it. Anyone else, please step forward and state your name. Address. Reward. Latrice Lacey does the forward. I would encourage you to vote no on this. You all have someone serving as legal counsel who has repeatedly shown that either they don't know the law or they don't care about the law. The way that he spoke to Alderwoman Newton last week was ridiculous. It was disrespectful. It was condescending. It was rude.

I would encourage you to vote no on this. You all have someone serving as legal counsel who has repeatedly shown that either they don't know the law or they don't care about the law.

Where else do you ask it? At the corner store? At the liquor store? This is the place. But you're told, I'm not going to answer that, and you're supposed to take that and walk away with it. The behavior of the legal department of the city of Davenport, I would characterize it as, like, the mafia. If they could get away with killing us, they would. I have had to file an EEOC complaint because of the behavior of those two sitting there, which I don't know if you all know about it, but how many other complaints have they caused? When I was. My first interactions were serving on the civil service commission, where your legal counsel leaned over the table and got in the face of the chair of the civil service commission yelling at her, talking to her incredibly aggressively. I've been retaliated against ever since, that I was told I'm not invited to department head meetings because I participated in the investigation before EEOC. How many people have you all paid out because of their behavior? I mean, what did the fire chief get? Five, six, $700,000? Who knows? Cause it was never made public. How much money is gonna be paid out behind stuff that they do, that they do wrong, that they do illegally, that they are knowingly doing wrong? If you all ratify this, you are co signing. This illegal behavior, this inappropriate behavior. When is enough enough? How much stuff are they gonna be able to get away with? And why are they dragging the new people into whatever this is? You all had no knowledge of it. You joined the council. You get sworn in and say, oh, surprise, I did this thing that I wasn't supposed to be doing. Can you sign off on it now to say, it's okay. I would tell them to keep it away from me. I don't want to touch it with a ten foot pole. If we have money to hand out like this, why can't we give those people who were killed? Why aren't there? Why are they not getting settlements? Those people from 324 Maine? Why couldn't we figure out housing for those people who lost everything? Because the city wanted to rush in and demolish the building with all of their belongings inside. We don't have money for any of the stuff that matters. We had somebody here last week talking about how they were unhoused, living in a hotel with their kids. They could lose custody of their children. But we don't have anything set up to help these people. But we can hand out $50,000 bonuses to staff members who tell council members that they're not going to answer their questions because they don't want to do their job. The same staff flat out declined to take action that the commission referred to them because they said, we don't want to. What job do you have that you can decide that you're just not going to perform portions of it and your bosses don't say anything? Well, not only not say anything, they don't give you a $50,000 bonus. I have to serve as a department director. I have to serve as the litigator for our department. I have to serve as HR for our department. I have to serve as it for our department. I have to serve as finance for our department, and then I actually have to do my actual job. And nobody cares that I have to do all this stuff. And I'm the lowest paid director. Some of these people have bachelor's degrees. I'm a lawyer. At what point is enough enough? At what point is somebody gonna say, this is inappropriate? These are equal pay violations. I mean, it just. It looks terrible. You're being investigated right now for some stuff that they cooked up in a back room, and then they're coming forward with another thing that they have cooked up in a back room, and now that they've been caught and know that the auditor's onto them. Oh, well, we need to bring it forward in a public meeting now. You can't do handshake deals in back rooms with public funds. You can't. It's illegal. And there's a reason that it's illegal, because these are public funds. You're spending public money. You have to do it publicly. You can't go back behind closed doors and hide. Oh, it's a personnel agreement. It's a personnel issue. You can't go and vote in closed session and give somebody a performance evaluation and give them a 10% raise and then that never comes back to the floor. It's never on an agenda. It's never publicly voted on. That's illegal. And your legal counselor should be telling you that. Thank you, anyone else, for conducting some work. I just want to point this out.

And both good and bad, in a sense, with this gentleman, I have several years of personal face to face experience in dealing with. So everything that I am saying right now is firsthand, no guesses. And I should also say I've been mentioned before that I've been teetering on the edge of homeless since physical attacks on my property intended to destroy me. And I have had difficulty filing my complaints. The way that civil rights complaints that go. If you file a complaint against the city housing department and the legal department and the administration and the mayor, it goes to the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Kansas City to have civil rights investigators. If you allege that a police officer engaged in illegal conduct of a white supremacist or racial and ethnic hatred based crime, that apparently goes to the Iowa Civil Rights Commission and they would have already been investigated on my behalf by now. But because trying not to be homeless has been number one. But you will be facing, and thanks to that lawyer, Department of Housing and Urban Development investigations and Iowa civil rights investigations. And I am asking, one of the key things in civil rights investigations is you're not supposed to retaliate. When the city staff showed up in my yard in 2021, they said if I complained that my rights were violated, the city would retaliate with a vengeance. The code enforcement officer said that the head of the code enforcement department, the neighborhood department, Mister Eckland, please stick to the agenda item specifically, please. I specifically met with that lawyer in 2021, and I gave him paperwork. I met with him in 2021, probably 2022. I know I met with him in 2023, in May or maybe April even of 2023, before the collapse of 324 Main Street, I handed him a thick packet of written documents alleging on the job white supremacist activity by a code enforcement officer in the city of Davenport, who is himself a landlord, who said landlords are superior and all the black tenants in the city of Iowa or the City of Davenport are inferior. This code enforcement officer could have been fired if he had investigated them in 2021 and behaved appropriately, could have been terminated for cause. They could have retrained everybody in code enforcement that you can't. It's this man said to me, the job of the city is to come down hard on the lowlifes on behalf of the higher class citizens. That was reported to him in writing. And I think he had a legal obligation to investigate my charges. You doing a port of order? I know you guys like to filibuster me. On June 1, there are. There's what I allege is a three year long campaign of trespassing, stalking, harassment, destruction of property. Two specific incidents where they destroyed my. Point of order. You're taking my time. That's abusive. That's bullying. You're bullying me. Point of order, please. Mister Eckland, please. We are talking about an agreement. Thank you. Please stick under his personal supervision. My native american artwork was just destroyed. On the day that they destroyed the manger. On the day that they destroyed my manger. On July 7 or July 6 of last year. I talked to him by telephone in the morning and I said, they are illegally destroying my property. City staff on that day, under the direct supervision of the code enforcement supervisor and parking lot supervisor, who. I have a photograph of her giving me the finger after she tore my plants out of the garden as she's cussing at me. And then she covered. She covered her finger like that, right as I took the photograph. She directed staff, with his permission, to remove my laundry from the clotheslines. They took down my clotheslines. That police officer. A police officer said that the police chief had a right to hang point. This is qualification. I would ask that. I'm calling a point of order because this is an employment agreement and I am asking the gentleman to speak to the agreement. I have not been able to file it yet, but I am filing a complaint to have him disbarred. I have asked the federal government to come in here and to pursue federal felony hate crime. Prosecution of that lawyer, I am asking the United States Department of Justice color of authority division to prosecute that man for hate crimes, namely the destruction of my property. Mister Eckland, please. If it's not the agenda item, it is the agenda item. He's the agenda. His behavior is the agenda. His legal opinion. His legal opinion is that it was okay for them to destroy my blueberries. His legal opinion is that blueberries are legal at the green thumb garden center. But when I buy them, and I buy an expensive flower pot and I bring them to my house. Mister Eklund, I'll sit down. But he's. Sit down. And I hope he's going to. Please sit down. Anyone else?

Please state your name, sir, and either your city or ward. David Anderson. Ward five. Right across the street from ward three. And I'm very proud of it. Just to piggyback on that deadened forehead. Brain damage by rock Island county jail correctional officers. I never wanted to talk about it. But after listening to that. Please. There is, you know, a point of order that has to be someday. A line drawn now to the issue. I also would like to point out the online agenda. Number two, under finance can be hypertexted. I would like people to get all the information on the accompanying pages, also online. I printed them all out. I would like them to study it. And I would like them to hopefully use this information and also others to discuss issues with facts and verifications and other things. I would like to give this packet. It does not have to be entered into the agenda minutes or anything, but I would like to offer that to anybody that would like it. Because I did do a lot of research. And hopefully the highlights and everything would point to everything that I said to today. So hopefully I won't have to talk ever again. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone else? Please state. My name is Mary Johansson and I'm in the first ward. For 44 years, I've owned my home. It's paid for, I've paid taxes. I support this community. I support the voting. I vote all the time. Now here I find a lot of issues about Brian Heyer, which is disheartening. If his representation is that bad, then I don't understand why we're rewarding him with a $50,000 bonus. I think neither of these two bonuses should be awarded until the state auditor is done finding out where the other money went and why it went. Some people were here when the city administrator was being harassed. I assume that they knew they were being harassed. I don't understand why the other assistant city administrators weren't harassed, but for some reason, two were not. This is not city government. This is not what we elected you to do to represent us for. If you're being railroaded, and it certainly sounds like it, I'm sorry, you all need to stop and wait till the state auditor is done with both the 324 Main street investigation and the money that was removed or given for harassment of I don't know what kind. But I'm disappointed to hear this. I'm disappointed that I don't understand who runs this city, and that's disheartening. I've been here most of my life, so I wish somebody would stand up, tell the truth, do the right thing for the rest of us, the people that pay the bills, people that pay the money that allows you to make choices to run the city. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone else. Is there anyone from council wishing to speak on this item? Okay, seeing no one from council move on to item number three. This is a resolution adopting the updated investment policy. Is there anyone from the audience that wishes to speak on this matter? Anyone from council seeing no one, we will move on to item number four. Item four. Resolution establishing the date and time for the annual Halloween parade and trick or treating as Sunday, October 27, 2024 at 02:00 p.m. and Thursday, October 31, 2024, 530 to 07:30 p.m. respectively. Is there anyone from the public wishing to speak on this matter? Is there anyone from council? Seeing none, we move on to item number five. Item number five is a motion directing the city administrator and related staff to implement an internal animal services unit and negotiate any related contracts or, or agreements. I will ask take a point of privilege at this time and ask if our interim city administrator can provide an update related to this item. Sure. Thank you. This item is simply reappearing on the agenda due to mechanics. When an item is tabled, it has to reappear on the agenda within the term that it was tabled for and how that was specified. I will say that we have continued to have great dialogue with the humane society. We are very, very close on an updated contract and agreement with them. We are at the stage right now where both sides attorneys are just fine tuning language, and both of us agree that this will come before you for consideration on the next council cycle. So again, very, very close. I believe we're probably down to about a sentence or two. The recommendation at this time that it be tabled again to allow for time to finalize the contract just for one cycle. Yes. Thank you. That said, is there anyone from the public wishing to speak on this item? Is there anyone from council? Oh, I see one. Alderman Jogdon. Thank you, Miss Chair. If no one has any comments, then I will make that motion to table for one cycle. But I'll wait to see if there's any further comments from my colleagues. I do not see any. Anyone from council. So I have a motion. Yep. So moved. Second and second. All those in favor of tabling item five for one cycle, please say aye. Aye. Oh, is it a roll call? Yeah, it's a table. Sorry.
