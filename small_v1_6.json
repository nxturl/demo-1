{"Pawtucket": [{"chunks": [{"start": 0, "end": 5000, "text": "There's no sound. Okay, I'm working on it right now. Thank you. This is a test. Anybody here? No. Oh. Oh, they just heard something. Oh, now they can. Did you hear? All right. Please raise your hand if you can hear. Nice. People are joining us online. They raised their hand. I want to make sure. Wonderful. We're back up and running. I don't know what the glitch was, but I appreciate it. I'm going to have to ask again and if they didn't hear me earlier, ask. All right. Yeah. All right. So those that are joining us online, I did ask earlier if anybody was here to join us for public input and I asked to raise your hand or use star nine in joining us by phone at this time. I'm going to ask again to make sure everybody's hearing properly. If you could please raise your hand or hit nine if joining us by phone. If you're here to speak at public input this evening. Again, if you're here to speak at public input. Just a moment. I could see someone. The hand is down. Can you raise your hand one more time? If you're here to speak at public input or hit nine joining us by phone. All right, so, mister president, I see none. So that leaves us two more in the building. Okay, I'm going down because I'm pointing. Okay. Glad that we are here, but it's meaning tonight to put everything at the table. The community is concerned as to why the departments do not work well together. It seems like the city punishes the school department and in turn that affects the children. I feel it is a disrespect that so many from outside the city feel they can come here and dictate what our children just will look like. Let me clarify what I mean for anyone. The superintendent and her team may not live in Pawtucket. However, they are clearly for the betterment and upliftment of our children and their education. They also embrace diversity and respect the cultural difference. So when I speak of outsiders dictating what happens here in a city as a whole, I'm speaking of teachers, police staff and heads of departments who live outside of our city in less diverse communities and who don't care to understand the true demographics of our city. I said this before. So when the mayor worked so hard to speak the city into thinking that the minorities don't matter, it trickles down to all involved in his administration. And sadly, that includes this council. Even disturbing, it includes a few on the city, on the school committee and school. When the divide becomes evident, the fingers, the finger point starts flying in all directions. But the message remains the same. For instance, Shalal, who played his own part as the chair and now wants to act brand new. And his demeanor says it all. During the last school committee meeting, his colors were showing so bright when he decided that he'd asked the same question more than a dozen times, as if he did not already have the answer. Not only did he have the answer, he was given the answer by half a dozen people. But he still demanded to ask directly to the superintendent. He certainly put on a show. And it reminded me of the male master wanting to only accept the response from the only, the black female to place the blame. And no matter who else answered, he wanted it from her. And even when she answered, he continued to ask as if he was not content. Until he wrapped that with, you know, I was reminded once again what Sherelle did that day when I watched the council meeting and saw again how the biggest concern was who leaked the info and how the blame could be placed on that same person. Did she allow the whip off to the city hall because he couldn't get it to work? Should you all be more concerned with the CFO marks came from and why he hasn't been able to find a million bucks that allegedly went missing along with the former CFO? It's simple. He needs to be given back that 3.2 from right here. The city needs to take care of the bonding issue, period. Look up the word transparency. Stop creating ways to hide the shady business of this administration. And please, council of district six, refrain from suggesting that only of that. That this should have been called into executive order. You seem to think that you're the only privileged parent again. Just like when you figured it was your plate, you figured it was your place to point out that a school committee member, black parent was out of order to take the podium when you were taking the podium, as well as if the issue was going to be handled from your student council. Let it be noted that we, the taxpayers, deserve to know how you all are handling the circus. Stop worrying about the leak, who sent from the communication to who. Nobody cares but the second floor and the three of you on the council. We, the taxpayers, are happy that it happens. Handle your business. Play your role. Get over the master mentality.

However, the words if $3.2 million ended up in my bank account, they spend it in a heartbeat. It might go to jail and I have to report it and give it back. What's the problem here? What's the protocol? Was the state police for them to analyze this mistake? I've amused that you all are acting like this is the first time. How much has been taken before with city's council's permission? You should be more upset that you didn't ask the council first before you took it. My words shouldn't shock you since this council never thinks on eloquent. The mayor also shouldn't be offended with my words because he seems to think it's always my perception. He's not here today, but I'm sure he's watching. Grevian created this racial dividend. He is creating division within the council. He is creating a divide within the school administration. By now we all recognize who's pilot culture and you all have done a great job making it obvious. You just get highly offended when I point it out because how dare anyone know that let alone announce it. He has a mini mastermind in every department just to name a few. Tina Pharaoh, Shalal Miles, Teachers Union president and a few of you sitting here who are sitting there. Thank goodness to us on Annie McPheer didn't make it in just to name a few tendencies. I'll stop there because I bet from everything I just said, it's typical that only that last sentence will be remembered because most of you can't stand to be forced with yellow truth. And my perception is that no matter how obvious I pointed to all of it, we will see it displayed more tonight because I've also noticed that you have no shame. I can hear what some of you are thinking. Here she goes with the colonism thing again. But wait, I can also hear some saying. At least someone has the voice to say what we're thinking. Is it me or is it actually here you guys go again with the colors of things and I'm just the chosen one who came here to say it out loud. You create such a divide, especially when community leaders try to voice concerns. You, the administration take it as if it's you against us. But the reality from my leadership standpoint, I can honestly say that dealing with officials in this city, it's more like playing chest with pigeon. Just when we think we are doing the right thing and making the right moves, there you pigeons go, grabbing all over the board so nothing really gets accomplished and savvy. At the end of the day, nobody knows. Kento. The final person signed up is Rod Sharpen. Members of the council I rise in public participation because as an elected member of the school committee and its current chairman, I wasn't afforded the opportunity to get an active participant in tonight's meeting. In fact, I've been left off with more meetings than I've been invited to. Nonetheless, I appreciate the opportunity to address the entire council. If the city had properly issued the bonds for school construction the voters approved in 2018, none of us would be sitting here this evening. I am sure we will hear of staffing shortages and other distractions intended to deflect from the Seminole issue at hand. The city needs to issue the school construction bond the city has never raised a concern that I'm aware of since I became chair in January regarding our finances. In fact, it wasn't until we notified the city that we were running low on money at Baldwin that they in turn sent eleven with concerns. Our former CFO had been out of the district for three weeks, but during the time we spent here, roughly eight months, we spent an inordinate amount of time down at city hall, including the majority of the month of January. In fact, after being elected chair, I asked for some specific financial documentation from roughly around the same time that the city CFO sent you all an email looking to increase the mayor's pay immediately by $70,000, while adjusting the council pay with raises from anywhere from 75% to 90% increase. The school committee was not mentioned in that letter, and that's okay. But are we supposed to believe that the city was so concerned with school finances in January, but they felt comfortable enough handing out immediate $70,000 raises? The issue is they never properly bonded back in 2022, and now they're saying it's because nobody told them they had to. The city had a chance to bond the entire $220 million back when interest rates were at historically low levels, yet they bonded 30 million. And we wait until now to bond the rest, and now we've exposed the taxpayer to a much higher borrowable cost. I've been talking about bonding issues in this city for over a year now, and I've often been ridiculed. Before, conspiracy theorists was my favorite. But here we are. So we can go through the punch list and the city administration can try and spin it that the school department didn't ask for the money, we didn't have enough staff in the finance department, or whatever else it is.

So we can go through the punch list and the city administration can try and spin it that the school department didn't ask for the money, we didn't have enough staff in the finance department, or whatever else it is. They're going to try and say, well, let's remember a few things. All of these construction projects have been widely advertised and celebrated by all of us. In fact, at the groundbreaking for Baldwin, Governor McKee cited how these types of projects have a pipeline of years in the planning phase, congratulated the city leadership for putting in the work and planning to see GE as a vote for these transformational projects. Is the city now saying they simply forgot to go off the bond? You'll remember the Shay renovations. Some of you were on the school committee at that time being halted the day before they were set to begin. In hindsight, it has me wondering if it was actually about the plan at all. Or did the city realize then they didn't bond any money for Shea either? After justifiable public criticism about the halting of the Shea renovations, the school committee was told that the mayor authorized the use of $10 million of bond money for basic renovations at Sha. Where was that money in mind? Remember, at this point, we're built winters with 30% revolver, all on a $30 million bond that the city issued in 2022. But in a letter to the school committee and the council dated 221 2023, the mayor stated this, and I quote, this request for $10 million with supporting documentation appears to be an accurate and feasible amount to move forward later on. He concluded with and again that, quote. Once again, I want to reiterate that my administration is committed to moving quickly and collaboratively with you and the Pawtucket City Council to move Shae forward. So my question is, where is the $10 million, what Bond agree to draw down on to get these safety renovations, critical safety renovations done it Shay, when the city CFO tells us there's no money left, I'm only left to conclude that that $10 million for Shea was to shut some of us on the school committee up, or it was an empty promise to the Shae community, or both. But speaking of the initial $30 million bond, let's remember when that bond was issued, when rates were at historically low levels. Are you aware the city decided to defer all the principal bond payments until 2026? On that bond, are you all aware of the $8 million principal payment you have coming due in 2026, or are you all finding out about it for the first time for me? So, as I see it, here's what's coming your way. In 2027, you're going to have an $8 million principal payment. You're going to have additional debt service that comes online from finishing the Baldwin project, not to mention any bonds issued for the unified high school. Speaking of the unified high school, are we still on track with that project? Ready to proceed? We just received the architectural scores from six of the seven community leaders that I asked to select the design team, I've been quiet about legal counsel. Whether we can. The school committee can proceed as planned, given the fact that we had seven people on the scoring team and only received six submissions. In fact, one community leader didn't make the deadline, didn't make the extended deadline, never submitted scores at all. So can the council clarify tonight the availability of bond funds for the unified high schools and assure the community here tonight that we'll have bond funds to start entering into these multimillion dollar contracts? I asked because in a recent meeting between the school and city finance committee, the city CFO made a very strong and deliberate point of mentioning that the $330 million unified high school bond still had to go through council approval. Is that accurate? I thought the voters approved the $330 million bond. So now the city will say, well, the unified high school, we have $50 million in state pay. Go to get started, folks. It's the exact same scenario that played out here. We had $40 million to get started at renters and now we're out of money and Baldwin's 30% done. I want to be very clear about this point. With the $50 million state pay bill, based on preliminary estimates we've got, that $50 million will likely handle the demolition of Lacord Stadium and the preparation of the land to build up and not much more after that. So I'll ask the question, what happens after we spend that 50 million? We have an empty lot. McCoy Stadium's gone. We got it doing $50 million of state money. And is that when the city tries to reclaim site control, transparency and communication? Right. Here's more for you. Shea and Coleman are in blue. And being on the school committee ten years, I'm disappointed in myself that I say that, but that's the fact. They're in rural. So while we're talking about finances, let's be honest, that there was never an intention to invest $10 million in the ship. Why? Because the city didn't have to get it. The administration owes the Shay community an apology. I'll conclude by going back to ball. We need $60 million more to finish bala six.

Okay, so this is a unique endeavor, and I'd like to thank everybody that I invited for being here and agreeing in partisan. I didn't know if I might be over my skis a little bit at first. I wrote the letter on Sunday, the 17th, after reading the finance director's letter from two days earlier. That was we put on the agenda, and it raised just so many concerns and articulated such a tight timeline with us. To get our budget in place, you have to back up from the end of the fiscal year to when we have two passengers of the budget ordinance, when the school committee has to get its budget to the mayor so we can make it into his budget. So there is a tight time. And the deadline, I think, was April 17, exactly one month when I was writing a letter. And we wouldn't. We weren't going to have another meeting until the 10th. April 10 was seven days before. I think I thought we owed it to every resident in Tucker to try to get to the bottom of what it seemed like it was a, a finger pointing exercise, and that's definitely not what tonight is about. Again, I'd like to thank everyone who agreed to attend. I sent the letter. Just superintendent, the commissioner and the mayor. I'd like to thank. The superintendent answered me within an hour. We're both working on day back within the hour. She said that she would indeed be there. The mayor touched base later today, later that day, and the commissioner's office responded that the commissioner herself would not be here, but would be sending a number of representatives that could indeed speak to the topics at hand. So I want to thank everyone for agreeing, and particularly folks here from Brian, who passed that along to the commissioner, our appreciation. I put in the letter, and I say it again, that I didn't have any, I didn't have any authority to command, nor did I have authority to command the superintendent of the May. But I think having rides in the room is going to be the soothing source of me to get the bottom of it. And again, this is not with any ill intent of finger pointing and hope it's not with any hubris on any part of the part who's here to deflect. It's really an endeavor to get to the bottom of how we got to where we are and how we can fix the problem if they're fixing work, and how we can move forward with restarting construction on Baldwin, finishing the audit building unified high school, and handling every day to day financial matter that we have to keep in mind that no money actually goes to mainstream. It's all here on Roosevelt's Avenue, and there has to be discussion between the two buildings about what's expected.

It's the same idea for a lot of other things, WB mason, or whatever the case may be. So the reason I asked everyone to be here right now was simply to get on the same page. It is absolutely positive and not about finger pointing. I'll say this to Superintendent Royal. I would look at one your job, especially at the time you took it, you committed a brand new superintendent, and within weeks, if not a month, heading into the new school year at the end of August, you lose basically your entire financial standard. And with that, not just financial end of it, but the institutional knowledge, I think that might be part of where the disconnect lies. So again, not about finger pointing, not about blame, hopefully about resolution, hopefully about explanation. And if there's a bit of misunderstanding that's still out there, hopefully having ride in the room will kind of save the day. So with that, I think what I'd like to do is, and the three folks that I invited, superintendent, the commission's office and we have with us Mario Panera and Lisa Odom. Sorry, I don't know what I did. And we have the mayor and we have a superintendent. So each of the three of you please upload them below. I'm sorry. Maybe come up and we'll utilize this table at the outset or maybe some open remarks. All four of you looks like Mario, you taking the helm from ride. So. Okay, thank you. You, Superintendent Royal and the mayor is here. I suspect, at least from a manager perspective and superintendent's perspective, that they may want to rely on staffers for the answers to some of the questions that are going to be posed. But I'd just like to give each of you the opportunity to make some opening remarks. And if you do want to need to rely on staff is start to be fine. So hey, this is about school time and you were tardy. So we'll go to your third. Again, thank you so much for responding so quickly. I almost hesitated to hit send because I wasn't sure how it would be received by your department, your office. So I was very happy to hear you quickly that you respond or participate. So just like to give you the floor and any vermont you'd like to offer. We appreciate. Good evening. First of all, I just like to say thank you for giving us the opportunity to come together to have these conversations. And I hope and I do foresee that we will be given many more opportunities as we work along side by side holding meetings to ensure that we're servicing the families, especially our students of cigarette. Thank you. And Mario Coreno. Thank you Mister President. Thank you everyone for having inviting us here on behalf of Ryan to help in any way we can. Very much aligned with your message of not necessarily looking backwards on your fingers to find ways to create a California opportunity. You have a myriad of funding for school construction projects. Many communities in state would be doubts of the amount that you have and the opportunities that are available. You have your mouth on first grade in the high school which will be the finest and safe. So we want to make sure you actually reach the very goals aiming towards your job. Thank you, Larry Mayor, at least you can. Sorry, I'm going to put the mayor real quick. I just want to say, just the preference, whatever the questions are coming my way, that I am an educator wholeheartedly in this profession on 34 years. I know I am accountable for the finance department of my. But I am by no means a CFO, chief financial officer. But as a leader, I have learned how to use resources, use people's expertise to get what we need done for our students in our school department. So I have reached out even to our previous CFO. She's been wonderful. I reached out to the ride department. I reached out to the city as well, because I know there is an important job that needs to get done. Yes, I did lose my CFO, certainly, but we are still on track to complete the year successfully financially and educationally. I just want to preface that before questions start coming to time. Now. We certainly understand that. I didn't envy you taking that role on Midsummer. Heading into a new school year and losing it wasn't just your CFO number two as well. No, I actually walked in. I was hired July 1. Best day ever in my life. I was hired July 1. And when I came in, the department was leading out. So I have not had a finance department since my team got you. I just want to make clear I have. We fully understand that. And yes, we are. That's why we will hire. And everybody needs reports that. So we were out of. We were without the CFO from the time Melissa June to the end of August, my last vehicle. So that was a whole couple months for my department to move out. And at the end of the year. Right? So we all certainly understand it. And it's not a witch hunter. We certainly don't incentive to give you any difficult questions that shouldn't be able to be answered. So that's all right.

Good evening, everybody. Mister President. Thank you, members of the council. It's great to be back in the chambers. The high level is. I do want to recognize the ride department commissioner Bayou Moreno and their staff for all the hard work that they put in trying to support this district in fine resolutions. And I want to recognize and congratulate the superintendent on her efforts and collaboration. It's important to note that this past Friday, there was a very productive meeting with all the members that I just met for the bride, from colliers to the city to school department as well. And in that meeting, there was a lot of collaboration. Members of the chairman of the school committee was there as well, and the vice chairs as well. Committee and our staff. It was very productive of collaboration. I think that's the message is we have to collaborate and move forward from this. And that collaboration is real important as we collectively talk to you and answer some of these questions from mine. You know, I'm going to turn the mic over to the finance director and their team. When you're ready for those finance questions. They're ready. I know the superintendent has her team as well. And Mario, you read your start, sir, so thank you. Okay. Thank you. So the way I envisioned it, Myra, questions for you will probably come later on or confirming what somebody else made said, if that's okay with you. And again, we're pleased you're here and we appreciate your help. Before we do that, I have one question for you, and then if you have other folks here that you think would be able to serve some of the more specific questions, very quickly, where are you or the school department relative to hiring a new CFO? And hopefully number two to bring that body counter. Okay, so currently we have three CFO, accountant and control. All the other positions have reviewed. I am on the tail end of hiring CFO. I have asked my chairman of the committee to participate in that as well as mayor. So we can make a great wide field together of a new CFO that's coming in and have to work with all of us, the controller and the accountant. We had our last final interviews on Tuesday, so moving forward with checking references and negotiations, so hopefully things cross, I would have my full department staff for the first time in my tenure within the next couple of weeks. So since they're not here, if you have, if we have specific district office questions, are you going to be the one answering or trying to answer or do you have somebody else here with you that is. Yes, I am. He sits here, my assistant superintendent. Okay, so mayor, who on your staff is. We could ask the finance director to flop seats with mayor and Mister Superintendent Ramsey, if you come forward, please just turn it on. Everybody hear me around? Okay? Yes, better. Good evening, everyone. I will just do. Since we have the city schools, we have. I'm going to try to be briefer than I was last week and bring you up today. What's happened since that particular time? Obviously this all came to a head because we had several issues that were going on all at once. We had the fiscal year 23 audit variety of reasons. We had to ask for an extension. That extension is due on March 31. We've been working very hard to get all the information together, school department as well. There were a few items that we were working on that I believe they have completed report should be completed matching the financials with the general ledger. Currently we're working on that, and the last one is the NCP report to the state. We are optimistic, hopeful and optimistic that everything will be done by our audit done by March 31. And that's important for a variety of reasons, set our financial stage, and also that's important going forward. The future bonds, instruments that we need. The second issue was the budget timeline. I know the council chairman has already briefly discussed that. Basically, we have a finite, fixed timeline. Everyone's aware that in order to get our budget together approved has to happen expeditiously. School will certainly be part of that, and you need to get that done as well. And that is very important because we have to have the budgets approved so that way we can send them to the state Department revenue. We can get a tax rate certified, and then we can send out the tax bill if there's a delay. And that ends up is a delight set about the tax bills. And that means there's delay in revenue coming in. Just pause for a minute. You know, with the, sometimes there's a misunderstanding that when we send out a tax bill, we get a grant or we get some different program. The funds immediately come and are available on that doorstep. They don't. And that's why we have financial planning on. We have to look at the flow of funds and how they come in, how they spent, how they acquired people's projects, make sure that what we're spending, we have adequate resources for. So, you know, in that respect, we want to have this budget done on time so we don't fall on another piece.

So, you know, in that respect, we want to have this budget done on time so we don't fall on another piece. And the last one that we talked about was the current cash flow. And basically what has happened with the cash flow. And everyone spends really laser focused on school and school building projects. But there are other cash flow issues that are going as well. I will talk about the school building project in a minute. But the other revenues that we look and believe to have city and schools operating function as well are in two of them, the essay funds, which are basically ARPA funds, american rescue plans, education and entitlement. We need to make sure that those reimbursement requests are done by attending that those funds can, we want them to come in before June 30. After June 30, there's another cascade, potential pitfalls that happen out of that. But moving back to the school instruction project, after we had this last one, briefly discussed many of these items, there was a meeting on Friday, and we had representatives of Rhode Island Department of Education. We had representative school department and we had a very good conversation as to where we were. What happened was needing to go forward. And once that was completed the following week, I got in contact with school superintendent, worked on the application that we had to send up to the Bridec, which is the Long island education building committee for that particular program. And what we decided between our financial advisors in internal discussions, that we should basically do two tracks, which to make sure everything functions. And that what we have proposed is that quickly we will go off a bond anticipation note. So that way we have adequate funds until August for the school construction project and for everything else that we need. Simultaneous to that, we are also putting an application to drive it for $80 million in funding for these six shorts. That application went out, so since Friday even we've been working at Lightning City to get started. The write process could probably take about three months. We won't participate. Having that type of funding available to. Can I interrupt a couple of things? You unload a lot. I could slow down. There are just some questions that are obvious. Someone saying, and I think you might like to ask. I'm going to ask them and see if anybody else has any. So the. You mentioned a band before the bot. Right. How much and how quick? We figured we're going to need between roughly $40 to $50 million. And we figure we can get funds in house in about 45 days. That doesn't look right. It does not. It would be. It would be an offering, probably banking, financial institutions. And that can be done very expeditiously. That would be folded into a larger bottle. So that part of the. And the path of utilizing a. Being of quicker, immediate. That's the problem. We're in a situation where we're kind of up against timeline relative to. Yes. Cool. School construction bonding. And so I guess my math is. What is there, what you told us the other night. Not putting us fine. Just trying to remember that there is. There's a process. Right. OPM says to the finance office, the school department, we're going to need this amount of money for this next stage of construction, whatever the case may be. Generally speaking, when we have a fully staffed, institutionally experienced finance department, they would come to our equally experienced finance department. Hey, we need that client to go this period of time. And that's how the bonding process is built. When you go to write, is that pretty much it? In a very vanilla nutshell, essentially. Essentially, yes. What we want to do is. Exactly. And right now they're college there. Project manager. Yeah. It's putting out a cash flow for that for now, all the way going to June. Yes. And the reason for the ban is that we don't want to get into a situation where we count on a reimbursement and it doesn't come in or things do happen. Projects in the cashflow projects you can predict. It's a guess that the actuals could be different. And if we're going to go out and do a ban, we might as well get sufficient funds to cover any of those sort of glitches for banks. And they've gotten funds because we certainly don't want to be sitting here again in another four or six months. Right. Because we don't even. That's why tonight. That's why we're here tonight. So. And I. Absolutely not. But is it any of the three of you can answer this? Is the loss of Melissa? I would say. Was that a bit of a disconnect of lack of free flowing information between Main street and about what was needed that accurate depiction or. So a former CFO was very creative with her cash flow machine, knew at the back burning the ins and outs of the bond approvals, the bond forecasts, the reverse forecast and spending forecast. So that loss of institutional knowledge, loss of flow between our CFO and your CFO had impact. However, I think we might be heading down the right path through opening communication, kind of.

Was that a bit of a disconnect of lack of free flowing information between Main street and about what was needed that accurate depiction or. So a former CFO was very creative with her cash flow machine, knew at the back burning the ins and outs of the bond approvals, the bond forecasts, the reverse forecast and spending forecast. So that loss of institutional knowledge, loss of flow between our CFO and your CFO had impact. However, I think we might be heading down the right path through opening communication, kind of. We've opened the books and we looked and we all want to remedy. Is it the school department's understanding that there was a certain process that used to be followed, but maybe we got fully followed on a period of time and maybe would help. So again, this really is not about blaming, it's about figuring out if there was a process. This is the way every other school district handled it, didn't handle it for a period of time. Are we on the path that, okay, now we all know what's expected of what the process is. Are we confident about it? I am, actually. I want to echo what Superintendent Morlow said. I am an educator and I don't play CFO on tv. However. So a lot of the CFO and the budget piece happened at the business office, but with the transparency and I think that what we learned through this process, we've all been status. Now, we all know how to do certain things that maybe we didn't necessarily know or didn't get involved in. So I'm confident. Definitely confident. So to also, my last CFO was in seats. He often continued that communication between the city. He was here four times a week. So the communication still continued that I know of what particular was discussed. I wasn't a part of those meetings, but I was under assumption that the communication still happening. And then there was also time when as well with Ryan also to continue the communication. So it didn't come. I didn't want people think it came to a screeching part. Never stopped. I think when you brought the UCF Oi who recently departed, he had a bunch of fires trying to close the fiscal year, trying to answer the auditor's questions, among the whole host of other things. So again, we can see where the wall might have been dropped or something belting the practice. Mario, I just have one quick question. I assume Kentucky relatives in school construction, bonding and ultimately bond reimbursement to ride and you know where we're in for anywhere between 80 and 91 and 90, 82 and 91% anniversary in the other municipalities that are taking advantage of the riot. Reimbursement funding reimbursement. Is that the process the school department talks with the city finance department and plans ahead to win the bond to go? Or is it, hey, the voters approve $200 million. Let's go tomorrow, get $200 million. It's the first planning. So you don't want to issue any bonds too early because then you're, you're paying all these interest payments for funds that you don't, you don't need to. They try to time staggering. It's not. And it takes coordinated coordination between each entry. That's right. And has ride been more heavily involved in the last four, five, six months with particular in, in general subject, finances in particular. The district invited us in January to begin, so we started to get involved with trying to figure out when would be the opportune time to request additional funds, which is not used, but of importance. So the Baldwin project is about, let's say 30% down around the $15 million that they've committed. So the state won't reimburse any more money until that project is complete. So at the moment, that project doesn't move forward, then the tucket has to pay 100% for an unfinished building. If you finish the project, which is assuming it's going to occur, then you only pay 9% of southern unit development. So there's no scenario that project can't finish because it's actually more beneficial to the city. Okay. And one last question, and then I'll kind of open up one last question for you, Mario. Relative to reimbursement, how does that work? Do you just say, hey, we got the key, the building is open, and now give us 91% of what we spent, or is there a process, again, for requesting reimbursement? So there's two main funding sources for school construction. So the first is pay as you go funding. If you recall, in 2018 and 2022, voters statewide approved two $250 million bonds. Kentucky was fortunate to receive 40 million in the first one and now almost 50 million in the second one. So you actually made out, I think, only second to province in terms of overall funding. So you received almost 100,000,500. Those funds are available as you request them. So as you're incurring costs in real time, you send invoices to us, we'll have a project manager review them, and we turn around payments in one day, which is the class from any state agency. That's only for pay as you go funding, and that's how you funded winters. Almost the entirety of winter is in Sega, where there's no bond reimbursements. All we do our payments really quickly for Baldwin and then for the majority of the high school project, that's reimbursement. So you'll end up getting some reimbursement rate as long as these projects commence. One of them's already started on track to commence, you can get 91% reimbursement temporarily, which is the goal, I'm sure, for all taxpayers. So you're right on track for that. But the majority of those payments are reimbursed with your bond. So if a year, let's say,", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City Finance Department", "insights": [{"observation": "Opening communication channels between the school department and the city finance department and ensuring transparency in budget and financial processes to avoid past disconnects.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Loss of institutional knowledge and flow between the former CFO and current CFO had an impact on financial management.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Ensuring that bond issuance is properly planned and staggered to avoid unnecessary interest payments.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Kentucky School District", "insights": [{"observation": "Coordination between the school department and finance department to time bond issuances and manage construction funding efficiently.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Increased involvement of external entities like Ride to help manage school construction finances.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Baldwin Project", "insights": [{"observation": "Project completion is essential for state reimbursement, and if the project does not move forward, the city has to pay 100% for an unfinished building.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The project is around 30% complete with $15 million committed, and finishing the project is more beneficial financially as it reduces the city\u2019s cost to 9%.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City Finance Department", "insights": [{"observation": "Opening communication channels between the school department and the city finance department and ensuring transparency in budget and financial processes to avoid past disconnects.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Loss of institutional knowledge and flow between the former CFO and current CFO had an impact on financial management.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Ensuring that bond issuance is properly planned and staggered to avoid unnecessary interest payments.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Kentucky School District", "insights": [{"observation": "Coordination between the school department and finance department to time bond issuances and manage construction funding efficiently.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Increased involvement of external entities like Ride to help manage school construction finances.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Baldwin Project", "insights": [{"observation": "Project completion is essential for state reimbursement, and if the project does not move forward, the city has to pay 100% for an unfinished building.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The project is around 30% complete with $15 million committed, and finishing the project is more beneficial financially as it reduces the city\u2019s cost to 9%.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 3649010, "chunk_end_time": 4101224, "base_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240327", "chunk_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240327&iCurrentPosition=3649"}, {"start": 39000, "end": 45000, "text": "ne.

Once you're done, and then as those numbers fluctuate, then our numbers would go accordingly. So we just tie our payments to your payments. The key is you have to finish the work. So we say, won't pay until the work. Hey, we're done. Oh, of course. Yeah. There's always, we could do a whole session of housing and I guess one of the things that is, whose responsibility is that? I assume the state is the one who asks, but would the state know? So every other city, would the city know absent seamless communication with the school department? I can't speak to what they would be doing here, but normally it's a, the form themselves require signatures from both entities, school department. And so I would suspect that in general they should be aware at least when this mission is every year, per state law, these forms are up to July 15. We'll send out an email last all the municipalities and the districts, letting them know the new forms are available. And then that gives them two months to work together. If work is complete, that gives them time to assemble the packages and send them to the state to review it. Thank you very much. I know I have a few questions on the lift. My left foot will be challenged again. Thank you, chairman, to the superintendent schools. I'd also like to echo the chairman's thanks for showing up tonight. And you indicated in your statement that we've had discussions about this, so we're aware of it, but that Miss Devine is still helping you out in certain situations that can be. And so I think some of the disconnect, at least from me, evaluating things, by far, I'm not the intelligent person in the room by law. I'm not CFO either. But I think it's a fair statement to say that we had two CFO's, long standing CFO's that had practices and timelines that they applied for stuff and they got it reimbursed in a timely fashion so that we didn't have any of these problems. So I'm curious if we don't take advantage of that to have Mister vine kind of lay out some procedures or guidelines for the new CFO to follow with our new CFO. And maybe even the fact that I think we've had some discussions about reaching out to our past CFO, trying to coordinate those guidelines to happen so that we can kind of resolve these issues in the future. How easy. Thank you. Anybody else? Did you say? No, Doctor Gregory? I remember reading a correspondence from the former doctor Williams almost begging absolutely die. That wasn't done. Specifics or intention. My concern is that, you know, Shea is a bank district, and so it's born. The building of Shay has been in terrible shape in quite some time. Basic things that were moved by the, the voters in 2018, for whatever reason, we're not done. I mean, that's concerning me. You have generations of students who are being effective. The commencement in Shay and the John Victorian saying how the boys had one working part on one floor, and that's sort of the case. Why does that happen? It's very troubling because 90% of kids in these schools are minorities. And I think they deserve a good education. It's not just about. I know teachers are great. They do what they can. What many were teachers today get some off. Even if it was no roof, they would still be there for the students. I absolutely believe that that is the case. But they shouldn't have to deal with trying to teach building. Second kids could even graduate plays or music or anything like that. That's not acceptable. Look at all these millions of money going around. So my first question why weren't you, I don't know if you were 2022 and I guess we should be 40 million. And Mister Ford is correct, you can trade back a lot. You'll understand why great amount of money was not requested because it sound like this is just a prime. You do. They sound big. How much it's going to cost to build winters and bulbs last month with issue levels about the agency maintenance lines in situation with the funds? Well, the first part I started in April 2020. So the first part of the question started in April of 2023. I don't have any institutional knowledge about formal bond insurance, how much they bonded, why I apologize. Might it be better sooner to answer that question about back to 2022 and why the city would instead of flowing a $200 million bond, instead do it in stages? Is it okay? I thought you were done with your answer in the representative department of Education, you don't go out and borrow the phone. Nobody goes out. You rely on your project manager and rely on instruction forecasts to borrow the money that you may usually, typically for year into months as it goes. That way you're not incurring unnecessary interest that's going back because then you end up at and it's, it is conservative and it's benefit, you know, for the taxpayers of the city.

They shouldn't be spending more on interest rate than they have to. That's the reason. No, the right representative mentioned July June municipalities submit the application. Are you trying to reimburse it? Yes. Submissions for the reimbursement looks like lisa might have, or maybe not. I have an answer and I might phone a friend in a moment to confirm my answer. Mario, but we submitted in July all of the eligible bottle reimbursements. In July, prior to the departure of the private CFO, all eligible bond reimbursements were submitted for reimbursement. Now there is a time waiting period for those reimbursements to come in and it depends on the amount of reimbursement to determine how long it takes to come back to us. And it could be anywhere from a year to three years depending on the actual amount of work that was done. And coming up for this July, we're already working with our colleagues, private leaders to forecast what is scheduled to be done and substantially complete so that we can submit in July a good portion of the work that has been completed to date. And there is a lot that quantify a lot just by a lot. But there is a substantial number of projects that should be completed in July so as to submit for reimbursement. Mister Carano, I'm sorry, did that answer your question? Also, if I may please. Understood that explanation. That's four. And they're talking about this for completed projects, and that's when you do the submissions. And so the project isn't complete by June 3. There's no submission when we're talking about completed projects. Fully completed by the phases. Correct. So in last July, when you would have applied for reimbursement, what project would that have been for? Do we know? I mean, I don't mean, I'm just wondering, I mean, make sure this was completed. All the winners still in the works. The high school still is in the works. So if we submitted for reimbursement back in July, I just wondered what projects would have been best. So, Mister President, I don't have that data in front of me right now. I just kind of took a nod over to project leaders and we can get that to the council, so you will know exactly, which was great, I'm sorry, just as a call. So is it fair to say that somebody was aware that there wasn't going to be enough point? I'm going to take the spirit of this particular meeting. I'm moving forward in fixing things. If we want to go back and check emails and boss and conversations. Did folks know this was coming up? Yes, but we were working very closely with the school department, anticipating some of these things, but unfortunately that never jumped. And I happened to write this particular letter at this point because it would be, it would be irresponsible for me not to let the council and the folks know that we need to work on this and we need to work on it quickly. The timing of it was such that, yes, it's dire, but it's fixable, and that's what you're trying to do, trying to fix it so all these projects go together, that all the schools are completely, and it does, so we get our reimbursements. That's the best explanation that I can give to you. And we could sit around and say, you know, maybe my literature went out in January, which went out in February. Unfortunately, it was March. And the impetus wasn't, of course, when the CFO left, it was for me, no chronicle to make some particular blame issues on here. You inherit what you inherit. So I appreciate that. I mean, I'm sorry, go ahead. I just want to state that when I became aware, working with ride, that's when I became aware. That's when I. About the situation that we're discussing. Then we had a meeting, and after the meeting, and we, like you said, communicate what your concerns was, issues, or whatever you went through at that time with the council. So I became aware by working with Marlon, this team, as to what we were forecasting. Looking forward to what we may be, April, maybe June, and just as a follow up, if you're involved. So, at one of the school committee, I think it was, that came up and mentioned there was going to be some significant amount, what they call value changes, which I see is cheapening of what was actually going to be done that school reservation for a long time. And it seems like there wasn't a lifetime thing, and the kids were supposed to get, hey, it seems like they gave the beat without. Just because people were aware that these funds were not available. It's not worth. No, not at all. Value engineering is part of every construction project that happens on every construction project, you have a price voters approve. You have a master price that rides approved based on square footage of number of students. If, because of the economic forecast, because of product availability, because of increases throughout, sometimes prices come in a little bit higher. So it's actually part of the construction credit to look at things that can. You shoot for the stars, and then you kind of feel that if you can't get them.

So I think at one point, councilor, you spoke about magnetic whiteboards, and there being a reduction through value engineering of magnetic whiteboards. I think I read in one of your correspondences to us, or maybe in public comment, so that we're not. Our students are not going without. They're going with what is good for them at that point. Plus, they have an interactive display panel that's going to be included. So it's. Magnetic whiteboards is a little on the high side for any classroom. So we scale that back to value engineering, and, of course, with the addition of the interactive display panel, the students are getting exactly what they need. So value engineering is to kind of look at meeting the best price that's out there based on the construction world and what we can provide the best building for the price. I'm not speaking that. I didn't mention anything about something that's working. No, that's okay. Like, in terms of more significant value changes. Such as. As opposed to having a food kitchen for the kids. It's a warm kitchen. That makes a significant difference because the kids should be allowed to homemade learn how to cook. They're being prevented from doing that. That's concerning to me. Windows being eliminated, a significant amount of windows. I believe the response though is given us, oh, well, there's going to be greens in the way, so they weren't going to be able to see anything. But that's not touch point. But I mean, these are concerning to me. Ultimately, I'm going to stop talking. So we get this done, get these kids in the school as soon as possible, the best place that they are, significant concerns operating. That's what I want to say on that. Thank you. Yeah, just a couple questions, Mark, I guess if you'd be the best person to answer. I know you mentioned earlier about recently, I guess was recent making a decision to ban 40 to 50 million. And that may happen. It'll be available around August when the money come in. And also utilizing rock could take up to 45 days. And you just did an app, complete an application for 80 million today. When was that decided upon to use that accommodation approach? So number one, when was that decided? Are there any other options other than that? And also, was that always going to be the two options anyway going forward? Did something change as to why you had to use both Vanna and Rider? After we had the meeting Friday with Ryan school department, obviously timing is of the essence. So we contacted our financial advisors and put it to them. How should we proceed? And basically their initial thought was to just go out for a ban and then send in a write back application later. And that was due to response. One of the concerns is with WYBAC, it's at least 60 or 90 days, depending upon when you can get on their schedule, maybe once a month. They can't call special. If you miss one, then you miss them. The 90 days could be even longer. And the other part of it is how to get funds infused into the city fairly quickly. Because again, we're all focusing on the school building and capital projects. We are still looking at our revenues, we're still looking at the other reimbursement that are millions of dollars that we are expecting to come in. And if they don't come in, we have to make sure there's sufficient funds to do the projects and keep the city operation as well. So that's one of the reasons why they came up with that doing. But initially the advisor will say, just go out to a band and then take your time and go out to the right back. We felt it was better. We can go get the application in if we have to make amendments or changes, at least it's in the hospital. We're on the schedule. Would there be any impact on the taxpayers? Would you want either one of those? No. It's going to be scheduled so that there won't be any payments in fiscal year 25. And given the interest rates that we may be able to get bank accounts, it'll roughly be a wash what we borrow and what we might have an interest in putting it into an interest area. Last question would be Shannon Schavaneau. In his speech earlier, the public comment made a lot of certainly statements regarding bonding. The city didn't bond at the time that it should have been stuff. I guess I just wanted a response to that because the chairman made a lot of points and I really don't know the back, I don't know what responses myself to that.

Last question would be Shannon Schavaneau. In his speech earlier, the public comment made a lot of certainly statements regarding bonding. The city didn't bond at the time that it should have been stuff. I guess I just wanted a response to that because the chairman made a lot of points and I really don't know the back, I don't know what responses myself to that. Constituent of taxpayer asked me, oh, you know, I was watching the meeting and I saw him make those comments. Is there any way to respond to that, whether any of those are accurate or not?

They bond it as they need it as they go along. That's the prudent financial thing to do. And I guess some of the options if you're not bonding for saving the money is out there. You said pay go or something. Is that what it's called? Hey, pay go. Since they're here, they can explain that a little better. That's an account that is set up that does direct payments and that's not part of the official bonding with ride. What was that utilized as someone? It was $40 million. Okay. Is that usually something you do that we never normally would use that. It's a fairly new program that Lord Adam has. It hasn't been around for more than three years. All right. It is something I was not familiar with. High voting does not. All right, those are my questions. Thank you very much. Just the back of the pay go, Mario. Is that not to bother not to pay? You don't have to pay that. Basically the idea behind it statewide the voters voted to. That's correct. And those are funds that you don't have to bond first and then wait for reimbursement, which means you're not paying interest on $40 million in the first example, the state's covering that giving you, if I'm not mistaken. I think back then we were all very influenced that the school committee was able to put. You said we were able to get 40 right away and then 50 right away. Because we were essentially early in the county. Right. You were one of the first communities to move forward, and that was fourth. I remember that was when there was actually a better working relationship. I think that was collaboration we could make like we still on the May at the time, but I think we were all very encouraged by the fact that Kentucky had the foresight to be there and the school committee's credit to be early in the queue. And we got 50 and then 40. So it's actually interest free construction? That's correct. In addition, you also took advantage of getting an application for the high school project, getting temporary bonuses with themselves or worth another 50 wouldn't have received if you didn't get through this past December. So you're in a very fortunate place, assuming everything. One last question for me on that. The high school, do you see any reason why that should be in jeopardy? Not from what I understand. I don't know. All right, thank you. I'm sorry on the subject. So just as a clarification, they go, so is that payment made by the state? I'm sorry for not turning this thing on first. Is that payment essentially made by the state or is it applied for from the municipality or the school committee and then saved by the state? The second version. So you fill out a form with backup documentation for the amount you need, and then once it's received and verified within one day, we turn around and give you. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. Go this way. Yeah, I'm just regarding those pay goal funds, now that's not restricted strictly for new construction. You could use that money to fix existing buildings, is that correct? That's correct. So you have two tranches. One tranche was used exclusively at winters, and then the second one is on, is actually worked exclusively to your high school because that's all that you had applied for this class program. It's based on the projects that you request funding for. Then you have an option to refine those funds to fund. Okay. So in the case of Shay, there's an approved bottle. You can use that money, that paper money to fix Shay. So you. There's. So you also have approval for what's known as capital Reserve funded projects, which are. Your district has six or 7 million of available resources, which you get reimbursement much faster than a bond as quickly as one year. The recommendation would be that you use those funds to repair Shae and avoid bonding shade. The reason being is that the moment you close Shae, which is going to close it in four years, when you build a new high school, the state will stop all remaining payments on a building that you close. So the suggestion would be to use this money you have. So imagine this. If you do 7 million of work, you get back 6.6 million as an example, the following year you turn that around and do more. Project Shae. So there is funding for shea from a financial perspective, I highly recommend not bonding a shea because again, the state close stops payments the moment you open your new high school, which is scheduled to open in the summer of 2021. May I have jumped on that? Sure. So if the school department decides to utilize Shea as another school entity, whether it's a middle school, the capital reserve fund is great. It's basic development. If they used it as another school entity when high school was built, would the payments university still stop? Does it stop on that project? It's a great question. I think that would be critical to now because you perhaps would also invest those funds differently if that building is going to become the middle school. As an example, if it had another use, you would want to make your repairs and renovations for that use as well as addressing the issues now. So I think understanding that would be critical. The answer is yeah, if that building is going to remain a school in Kentucky serving who knows who", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Rhode Island Bond of Education", "insights": [{"observation": "They bond it as they need it as they go along.

Yeah. And I'm very familiar with the process where you get your reimbursement rate and then you take those funds and investment and go back to the same school and then you don't have to walk upon it. So it is a great program. Thank you, council. Very important. Yeah, I just wanted to thank chairman Shabnow for sure. Not to say the fact that he was inviting Japan since he directed towards the school committee who's being villainized school committee members by not being invited to relative to this thing, there seems to be second school department financial history. But I think it's bigger than, I think it involves the city finances as well. Just the phrasing gets otherwise, and I don't think that's property. People work hard, they're being elected. They look at the residents of the city, make sure the kids are property educated. I appreciate them getting in the option. It's not an easy thing to do by the last thing I'm going to say is I'm troubled by the fact that so knowing that we didn't have full money to complete fall and dual against the school we had to do for residents children that Barney would go on to fund the stadium. To me, it's troubling. Our duty is to the residents and the children of the city and not to supply. So I think if you have to look at priorities and when the bonds should be issued, make sure the schools are done, the kids are popular. Does the tip bonds for the stadium have anything whatsoever to do with school construction bonds? You agree? Okay, thank you. And you know, I'll take exceptions to your suggestion that school continue being vilified, especially if they're being vilified by not coming in. Right. So we, we're holding this meeting tonight to talk to folks who are in attractions about finances. And I said at the outset, I sent the letter with three individuals. I didn't copy anybody else on it. Nobody else was invited. I sent it to the mayor, the top dog in the city, the superintendent, the top dog in the school department, and the commissioner of education, dog in the state. I didn't know if any or all of them would agree to participate. Number one, we scheduled this last Wednesday with the intention of putting the agenda together for Monday because we didn't know whether we would be able to use this building with the event rainstorm over the weekend. So when the agenda wasn't together, it was sent as an invite to the chairman. On top of that, I reached out to the three people I reached out to because we have heard unending that the Pawtucket school committee and other school committees lament the fact that title 16 has invested quite a bit of responsibility and decision making in the superintendents, and that sometimes it's difficult to get information. Matter of fact, I think the chair said he was having trouble himself getting information from a finance department in the school committee to an extent where somebody was going to be making an Apple request on this behalf. So I invited flight invited because I thought we would get the biggest bang for our buck in trying to get everybody on the same page. I just said five minutes ago, I gave quite a bit of credit to the school committee for putting us in an advocateous position to be early in the queue for $90 million and for doing other Payo projects. I don't see it that way, actually take exceptions being suggested otherwise. So, Councillor Lucian, first of all, I want to thank everybody, you know, trying to help us sort through this and what council had mentioned about procedure. Just want to make sure I'm clear and the rest of my colleagues are clear. So basically the OPM speaks to what he need is, and then they go to the CFO, they internally meet the finance director of the city, and then it goes out to the bond based on the information. Is that correct? I would say that's essentially correct, yes. Okay. And it's the same for the reimbursement process. It comes from the OPM to the CFO, school department, then to university finance director. Yes. Most of those documents of schools and the city house. All right. So, you know, then again, this is not looking back, it's looking from this point forward. That is the process. Am I correct? We're all in agreement. Ok. I just want to make sure for clarity, so we don't know regarding, as you mentioned, about need the money supplementing June 1. We ask funding entitled ones we agree on target and to receive those fundings by that date for this year. Well, we. I think you said June 1 month. We made it by end of June. Yeah, we needed by. We need to have them in by the end of the fiscal year. So it's going to count this fiscal year because those funds, you know, federal funds were considered a part of the revenue, the budget bank. So if the revenues don't come in now, our budget is out of balance.

So if the revenues don't come in now, our budget is out of balance. So we are on track to receive the results definitely by the end of the school year. Correct. And just to do a little bit of explanation, so as far as esser and title one funds, we have currently requested approximately $5 million so far. And when you look at your esser and your title, when I came to this district, I walked into our district being placed under an audit because of what was going on with finance. And with that being said, that did push the process back because we can't move forward into the audit like during life. Corrected everything. Everything is in its right place. Now you can start setting up your accounts, applying for reimbursement, spending time. So that was the delay for the title. Very similar to essence. Same thing. So when I walked in, I had to put some things in place. We bought the team together. We had to readjust our budgets to more align to the requirements by state. So now we are approximately 5 million that has been requested. And you have to also understand when you request funds from titles, I have teachers that I pay for tutoring for after school programs. That goes up into about the last week of school. I can't pay people in advance until they work those hours. So I have until the end of the year to use those funds that was designated wherever our programs are to spend that fund. So that's why what Mark said earlier, it's kind of hard. Kind of like guesstimate it because you don't know, because we don't consider, don't know. I say, well, I have program that's running for two to four. I have 60 teachers. They really don't know unless I say or this is what we are designated to spend by the end of the school year. So that's kind of how it works. You don't get it all back in one month. Understood? Understood. Just want to make sure that we want to see through our traffic by the end of the school year. Just because it is a lot of money, it affects our students, it affects our educators. Make sure that funding is there for the betterment of the school. Thank you so much for answering my questions. One quick follow up here. Follow ups. How much title one money can we get? How much estimate? And so we can't ask for all one lump sum. Understood. But can we ask for over ten months, like monthly over ten months? If you pay the student teachers for ramp up or out of school or whatever the case may be. Can that kind of be a day to go? Can we request the title one money before in chunks, I guess, instead of waiting until early June and then when we get reimbursement before the end of this, that is great. We can so approximately title. So let's say title. I was talking about title 1234, partly in IDPH. Approximately $5 million and then, sorry, $9.5 million. And then for the Esther we had about 22, 31. Yes. And what we heard last Wednesday was there's either delay or jeopardy of some of those funds coming. How's that? 8 million views. So federal grant funding or federal. After having heard what you said last week, are we comfortable that any of the federal money, which would be as much as 20 plus million dollars, comfortable, we would get that before. What would the 50 years have been? I would love to say yes, but it is a reimbursement from a federal agency and you can never tell what's going to happen. Luckily, I think Congress has funded the government through that time period. But if there was a shutdown, things like that happen, or paperwork that's submitted that after we submitted the tiny model is, I'm optimistic, but I don't think either one of us could sit there and guarantee that there's something. And if it's requested, this doesn't land in the bank account until July 10, that is still considering fiscal 24 revenue? Yes, I believe we can. Okay. Okay. So got a little bit of this. Yeah, there's a little bit of wiggle room. Probably would have. Should have put up, asked for reimbursement as when we go off of the school year. But I think that's an excellent suggestion. I mean, I know in the past quarterly and superintendent just pointed out particular issues and being stick a little. We absolutely get it. We absolutely get it. How it could happen. Can we absolutely get why you had to send the letter? You said when you did.

There's not going to be any cash issues that the building of the schools are going to continue. They're going to finish, cross out figures that everything is totally complete by June 30 of 2025 as far as the construction is concerned. But there's a lot of intangibles, like with any project council members who have been in years sitting on an IC, you know, the dream and the private. Sometimes it gets beat up a little when it comes into reality. As was mentioned earlier, you have issues with supplies, delays, weather. A lot of things can happen and you can't predict on so long as the dream is shared. We can all work towards sales council, did you have questions? Mark, you just talked about how we're looking like we're in good shape. In your original letter, you said that this might end up affecting salaries. And I know we have a lot of educators for learning. Also, I had gotten messages from constituents who are educators and one person, their simple message to me was, am I not getting paid after April 15? So I just want to follow any nervousness. If you could just make sure, just confirm that we're in good shape when it comes to the salaries, the pay of our educators. That was the point of that particular letter because I was trying to protect folks who work jobs to do it and they get their paychecks. And that was the most important. So it was to save funds. So that way we could have everyone being paid by the end of this council. Greg? Yeah. Just one final question mark. In your letter, which one you had sent out, you mentioned. Well, we have a financial group here. We went through the particular books and to sort that out. And the apple chart. $6 million. And again, thanks to all of you coming here and discussing. Is that 6 million, is that what the infusion of 3 million from last week, correct? Yes. I guess we were hearing for a month and a half that what they thought was 4 million was negative. 2.26.2 hasn't been found in the three minutes last week. I assume I could be wrong, but I assume I was way out of town, was the previous school CFO and put in reimbursement request for $3 million for constructive funds that would go back into the capital reserve, exactly where that free rail would come from. I can't follow that line of bread crumbs as to where it takes another one to do that. But that was one of the things that the former CFO was really trying to dig into, because he was getting conflicting balances on the construction funds he was digging in as to where it was. Now, he never completed it. But as we said about his work, we are making progress towards cleaning and making sure that the funds that come in putting the proper line items in expenditure. So what was thought to be six or 6.2 really? Is six or 6.2 just been all from wrong shells, so to speak? Correct. So it came from state. So we got the first 3.2 we get. First one came in September, updates the wrong. So we pull that. But it's supposed to be in this right place, capital served. And then we just received 3.2. So now that's why we're announcing the 3.2 that goes into the capital was where I assume it's maybe other one. Is that three? I think it was like 3.0 something. Correct. So that we'll just call it three deeds. That $3 million, Mario, was that. That's going into that capital growth company presume that was reimbursement that was requested capital reserve eligible projects? Yes, that's correct. Those are projects completed and submitted last summer. The state always makes payments to equal amounts September 15 and March 15. So the state sent, you know, over $6 million of that funding. And then speaking with Collier, they're tracking about four and a half million projects by June. So the money exceeds the need. Friday we asked them if they should perhaps look for 100 million to shave would be a problem. Start to transition funds to that revolving funding away from that explains quite a bit. And again, happy news. So on. Any of you folks that being here and enjoyed all this, have anything you'd like to add? You just want to run out and go? I just want to take the opportunity to thank my team. At least your team was here also the school community, and they did nothing but supportive along with city as well as pride. We could not have been where we are also just sitting in both sides. My role is to make sure that we all continue to work together. Because like I said, I'm an educator. I'm here for students and my families. And it is my job to ensure I make sure we all continue to work together so that we take our whole city and listen to the next level. I can't do that without anyone. So just keeping that in the forefront, our students and our families, no doubt we will take our mission to the next level. We appreciate that. So very supportive.

Chairman Wilderhain. Councilor Moran. Councilor Rubio here. Three in attendance, no public input, not from up there. No problem. Okay. Councillor Rubio, number two. Number two. A communication from Bianca Poly Castro, planning director, to the honorable members of the Pawtucket City Council. Council for a capital improvement plan for 2025 through 2029, environmental infrastructure bond. I move to take this up. Second spend motion has been made by Councilor Rubio, seconded by councilor Moran to file the communication and take up the capital improvement plan for 2025. 2029. All those in favor? Aye. Karen, you want to go ahead and start? Sure. So the capital improvement program consists of a six step process, which is a listing of capital improvement projects, equipment, a ranking of the project, which this year we have done as one umbrella project. So in the past, we've done a lot of different line items for sites, sidewalk improvements, row state improvements for DPW, but now. I'll go into that in a minute. But anyway, ranking of projects, a financing plan, a timetable, project justification, and then the classification, itemization, and explanation for project expenditures. What is being proposed for this year or this upcoming four year cycle is a $20 million grant infrastructure bond that would allow for this was approved by, recommended by the planning commission earlier this month, and it's a lump sum that could then allow for flexibility of use for what is needed for DPW and other infrastructure needs in the city. So over the past couple years, we've been fortunate in being able to get a lot of state, federal grant money for some of these things. But going forward, just for our bonding purposes, if we get federal funding or state funding for one project, we're not limited in what we're getting from this. Well, put this much money towards sidewalks. But then we get federal funding, we can just utilize, use the bond money to something else rather than being restricted to. Correct. Okay. Okay. Which is appreciated much of what? Because half the time we hear that the bond money is run out and we are limited to the scope of what we can do because that's the way we wrote it this way here. Just run out opens up that scope. So any of the council members have any questions? Councilor Rubin? I do. And just for the record, this is a new bond, correct, that we're putting on the ballot for this coming? Yes. Here. And so we'll, you're saying in, in the past, we've been able to get funding from the state federal fund, so we've been getting more funding from the state federal level but that's more important, which is one of the reasons why we're doing lump sum rather than. So, in the past, I have the like CDDB, HUD grants and stuff like that. Yes. So we have lists of ones that. So the capital improvement program that was approved about two years ago had all of these different line items on it, but with the. As of the gay federal states, we utilize that in different ways. So we'll be paying this back with federal, state as we see this completely separate. Okay. That's what I was just the explanation for why it worked. Okay. Is this the first time we've done this? Right, the capital improvement program? Well, the 20 billion for the environmental, usually we've done the separate little ones, you know, the seven or eight different bonds. But other municipalities do it this way, and then we'll get a breakdown of costing of just projecting projects, projects in the corporate moving forward. So, yeah, even though we have flexibility here, we'll understeed 20 million and the funds are available. Yeah. We need additional money in one particular area. We'll use the sewers, for example, where in the old days, well, last year, two years ago, you might have got for a million dollars. We have a major traffic. $5 million. Not having money now, the way it's set up, 5 million could be put right towards the sewers. Fix that high. We do have projects set up like priorities. We do have all those still set up. It's just the way this way around it will be to basically help the rest of. Well, you have more flexibility, I guess, doing it this way, too. They have to go to so much red tape and be defined by one thing. You have the projects. It's just right. I understand. Thank you. That's all. Were you looking for more money or less like, or is this, when I put my numbers together with what we have currently with existing bonds and stuff like that, it actually came out. Any. Anything else from finance director or director Holt? You guys want to say anything or. No, I think both of our clients have covered very well. Obviously, the more money is better, but we have to afford to pay back to big projects. Okay. And we'll just go to number three. We don't have to take the motion. Just do it on number three. Yes.

In support of the bond legislation, the amount of $20 million for various environmental infrastructure improvements, and for the fiscal years for 2026 and 2027 approval, all those in favor on a roll call vote, Jimmy Wilderness. Yes. Councilor Moran? Yes. Councilor Rubio? Three to zero. Thank you all for attending. Thank you for the information. It's much appreciated. Who attendees. Do you want the answer to the council meeting tonight? We found tonight. Yeah. Cameron, I think would be the most. Rick, you got roll. The rest of you guys can leave. She's the only person. You're the lucky lady. He asked me who I wanted. That's the answer I gave, so. Yes. Evening. Welcome to city council chambers. Before we begin our agenda, we have public input. There's nobody in the building or who signed up for public input, but I believe we have at least one individual online, a representative from the US Small Business Administration. Is that correct? Yes, that's correct. All right, well, welcome. I know you sent in an email earlier today if you would be able to offer some public comments. I guess it's related to small business association. So the floor is yours. We can give you up to five minutes if you need it, but tell us what's on your mind. Okay, sure. Thank you so much. Yes, it won't take five minutes. Once again, my name is Tahita Mateen, the public affairs specialist assigned to the Rhode island declarations as it relates to the current declarations regarding the flooding that took place in December and January. So a part of my job is to attend meetings like this just to make sure that information is getting to cities and their constituents about how they can receive help. So the SBA, you know, our job is to help businesses, but not only businesses, homeowners and renters and nonprofit organizations as well. Businesses can receive up to $2 million. Homeowners can receive up to $500,000 to replace their real estate, and renters and homeowners can receive up to $100,000 to replace or repair their personal property, and that includes automobiles. The SBA loan terms for the disaster loan are very favorable to those survivors. Survivors receive up to 30 years to repay the loan. You don't have to wait for insurance to settle. The deadline is coming up on May 20 for physical damages sustained. And you know, that deadline is going to keep coming quicker and quicker. So we say don't wait for insurance to settle. Go ahead and submit your application and get into the queue. Get into the process there. You know, the interest is extremely low. There's no payment, no interest for twelve months. And that's just to help the survivor and the business owner, you know, get through that first year of not having to make any payments. And to locate a center, the nearest disaster recovery center near you, we recommend people to go to FEMA dot gov to locate the closest center near, near the areas. And also it just makes sense just to go in person to speak with someone, you know, while the centers are set up. You don't need an appointment, you don't need to call ahead of time. So just find out what center is close to you. Go in. SBA is at all of the FEMA centers, and we also have standalone business recovery centers. And just to go in and talk about your application, find out what you're eligible for, start the process. I always tell people it's better to have the funds and not need them than to need the funds and not be able to get them because the deadline has passed. For more information on the SBA disaster loan, you can go to SBA dot gov disaster. You can apply online as well and just to get more information. But we always just recommend towns and cities and counties to apply now and decide later. And just to let everyone know we are still in the area, making sure that people understand there is federal help to recover from the flooding that took place in December of 2023 and January of 2024. And with that being said, that's all that I have for the council today. And thanks for allowing me to put those words in for you and your constituents. Sure. Thank you, Tahita. We will be sure to pass that information along to our economic development director. Thank you. Thank you. Have a nice night. You too. Correct that case. I will roll the order. President Mercer?

What we wanted to do was add book a service to part of the service that we rendered at the bar. So I think the reason why we wanted to do that was because when our patrons are requested for us to be part of our service and once we don't have them, they just once you don't have a service, they leave. And to manage and provide services. So that's what we are looking to provide. Yes. Now, is there a certain amount of percentage that they have to sell? 50% of your revenue. Everything must be derived from the sale of tobacco. You understand that, right? Yes, we do. And it's indoors only. And you did have a chance to speak with the district council? Yes. And I was told by the state to come back to the city. I was getting approved. Have you ever done any. Have you ever oversaw a business serving singer before? No. This review. Okay. Unfortunately, the council just let me know she was going to kill. And if she didn't weigh in on any of the issues, would it be a hardship to continue to matter for more weeks till our next meeting? Give us, for a sense on the matter, would that be hardship? I don't think so, but we're hoping we're getting it done tonight. Oh, it'll still take a little bit of time for you to get everything taken care of with the cleric's office in the state. Anyway, I just. This has been a. Who could spend a little bit of a hot button topic in the city over the course of last handful of years and not knowing full well what the district council thinks of it and her constituents in the neighborhood, I would just be a little bit uneasy about it. So if it's not a serious and it wouldn't cost any additional money, we would just continue the hearing until that night so she could wait. If you have no objection. No. Okay. In that case, just wait there for just one moment. Is there anyone here in the audience who's here on this matter? Can anyone on the line. Okay. In that case, I will entertain a motion to. We continue the public hearing for two weeks. It's been moved by councillor, the second by councilor Moreno, that we recess this hearing and continue it until the next meeting of the board of license commissioners when we can get a conference before you. That's the motion? Yes. Any discussion on that motion? All in favor? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries. Continuing this matter, and I will see if conference can reach out to you before then and get full production. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Item number six was continued.

And because of the hour operation, knowing that, you know, they're more limited to, again, working out. What's your relationship with. I'm just her friend, but I've been there. Yeah. Okay, so just to reiterate what the hours are going to be currently, as per. And then. So let's see, anything else changing from the past owner to the Senate? Yes, there's actually. No, she's actually been the one running the whole show, and now he's just literally took a while because of COVID And a lot of things happen in between.

And I noticed the parking lot actually got cleaned up a little bit, yeah. Only, though, do you see the dumpster area that's been put up in the last. Every time. Okay. Um, how long this is? How long has it been? My colleagues, I didn't know it has hoop out until I actually got on the forks, and it was like I said, it's absolutely after game day.

That's good to know. All right. I thought, honestly, because I hadn't heard anything from anybody, I thought I had new posts because I haven't lost traffic there or anything. So it's good to know that it's been running and quiet and all that. I did reach out to the captain today to see if anything had been happening the last year, and there was nothing. So that's all I need to know. Anybody else on here again? Anybody here for the continued hearing who wishes to be heard on this matter? Anything? Could you, Michelle? Nothing? Okay.

Councillor Rugo. Yes. Council cordair. Consul Gregor? Here. Council Moran? Here. Council Moreno? Here. Councilor Rubio? Here. Council Skoviak. Here. Council Wilderness. Here. Eight in attendance. Mister President, I call for approval of the previous minutes from April 10, 1924 of the annual Control Committee, the finance committee, the city Property Committee, the Committee on claims and pending suits, and the city council of the April 10, 2024 meetings. The animal control committee is new property committees and the city council. Are there any items, any concerns, amendments on any of those minutes? In that case, all in favor? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries. Item number two, make a motion to approve the consent agenda and correspondence moved by councilor Ruser, second by Councilor Moreno. That approved. You given the items for the consent agenda? Correct. Bonds. Are there any matter on a consent agenda? The council would like to address? Judiciary Councillor Wilbur Hayne. Councilor Gregor, Senator IMG, the exception of Fhij and l, all in favor? Aye. Both carries. We'll go alphabetically. Cost a little riddle. Yes. F is communication. KP, this executive project manager. We got in the bill stuff that went out with the water to meet a replacement project. Just, you know, they're going to be putting out brand new water meters for every home and business. And it's. I think this is a great program. It's not going to cost me, the homeowners, anything. All this is going to allow you to see real time water problems. If you have a leaky toilet, you're using excess of water right now. It's more you don't know that's happening. You find out when your bill comes in. Okay. Now you'll be able to see real time. They're going to be working on a computer program where you can sign up and get a link when your water meter wants to start. We place can identify when there's excessive usage. And if you set it up, you'll be able to get those alerts on whether it's the phone, email, etcetera. So I think it's a great program. I think it's a great customer service item that it's going to take a while to go out, probably a couple of years. I think it'll get everybody else cleared away, but I think it's a positive thing. I think it's great for the consumer, for the property owners, business owners, because now you be able to see in real time when you have a problem. Sometimes you don't see that, and it might be underneath, you know, your foundation or side, wherever the water is. Sometimes you see, sometimes you don't. You might have a running toilet. You don't realize how much you're actually using and can use a lot of water. So environmentally and financially, I think this is a great program. So just wanted to explain a little bit to me. Thank you, counselor. Council. Thank you, council president. I just want to take a moment to turn on and take advantage of this agenda to thank the people, everybody with the hoarding situation. I know this turnaround deals with the animal shelter in the court, but everyone knows of the hoarding situation. The part of the league around SPCA, Lieutenant Skahan told me that the veterinarian services from, I think it was Diamond Hill vets turn around and did all the work for free. So I wanted to thank those people for their commitment to the analyst here in Tuck in. Most of all, I wanted to thank the staff and Lieutenant Scathan for the work that they're doing over there. They take it upon themselves and really thank the public. People have increased their phone calls over there, wanting to donate, wanting to volunteer to do whatever they can to help out these animals, and it's greatly appreciated. So I just want to acknowledge that. Thank you, golfer. Anyone else on item eight? We are now item five, council drivers. Item I is the communication John volume, recreational managers of the city council Ticket Products Commission annual report.

So I just want to acknowledge that. Thank you, golfer. Anyone else on item eight? We are now item five, council drivers. Item I is the communication John volume, recreational managers of the city council Ticket Products Commission annual report. I want to say what's the John Blade, the part that should have provided a report which is for the 1980 something, 80 something. So how did. Yeah. 93, 94, something like that. Appreciate the commission's goals here, which calls for them to visit all the various recreational facilities throughout the city and when possible, conducting there, which is a big break. Also ensure that all locations under the jurisdiction, which is essentially all parts in the recreational facilities in the city, fully utilize and maintain something which was in effect. Right. The whole fiasco was more appealed instead of what happened. And I won't read the rest of the goal when maybe he's on page six which was about Molly Field cap like the only thing that Steven ever disclosed since June 2022 which we all know and nothing else and I'm fluttering parks commissioner report suggest that's all I need to say about that. Thank you. Anybody else at J? So j is the communication which I wrote except for the rural department of Environmental Management, National Park Service, as well as various entities and folks and organizations. The city's administration submission of the conversion plan from Wally Field, which also includes McCoy Stadium Annex and Donald park. These are LWCFI from the 440-0207 and 44 0051. My concern here is that the resolution authorizing authorized battery October 20, 2022 specifically had a provision which said there was no relocation conversion. Five was to be submitted prior to the council of the whole body that I want to review it, comments on it and so forth, as well as the public. They have an opportunity to comment on liability and that was entirely skipped. And last thing is that a plan was submitted to the Libm not once, but twice. Zero notice to council, zero notice to the public. And the propriety of also including Laquartus, Adamanix and Bernard park is also concerning me because for all charter only the city council, it has the ability that they would transfer conversion, sale, lease and so forth. Property Swaziland has been no authorization those presented to this council authorizing additional protected spaces. So I think the council as a whole should be concerned that the division of power between this is a Tokyo government administration and council might be suffered. But we're equal. And being emasculated and being ignored is concerning to me. And I think everyone can. Especially matter of fact that the whole issue is normally healed within the two year plus public outcry which has been ignored. So just simply put out a discount has never been noticed once. But even though a plan was developed or the plan has been submitted, provider calls for the rescission and suspension of that application. From such times risk reviewing the public and property to Canada as well. And make the comments. It's about transparencies, about public participation. Council surprising. That's all I was going to say on the subject. Thank you councilor. Final item is l, council moraine. Item l is a communication from Lexus galvanic transportation. Richard Goldstein MNC clerk response to traffic light on Inquiry Avenue, Cottage street first of all, I want to thank Mister Galdeo for responding in a timely fashion this time. Although when you read the communication. He does mention that they did some work on the signalization that Newport Avenue back in December. I find it disappointing that we had to ask them recently in April for work that they already did in December. You think they would have forwarded that communication back in December to us? So what I'd like to do is there is a mention in that communication about potentially an option. I mean, they're not saying they would do it. I'm sure there's a costly incense. But they did mention in that communication about potentially widening the road and adding in some left turn lanes. What I'd like to do is, number one, is I'd like a communication to be sent back to Mister Galveo. Actually, I mean, Miss Galveo. Sorry, Miss Galveo, she's a college. A college comrade prosper. Sorry about that. Asking a response if they would consider potentially. Is there any consideration going forward of potentially widening the road at Newport Avenue and Cottage and considering putting in left turn links? I'd just like to dovetail on what she said in that communication to see whether that's something that they would consider. So that would be at least one communication and make a motion for that. The move by Councilor Moreno. Seconded by councilor Moreno. That council sent a letter, Lis Galzeo at the department of Transportation asking about the feasibility of widening that area, as she suggested in her or letter D mark. Uh, but the letter, we're right, right? And then including left turn. Including adding left hand. Left hand turning. Are we talking about heading west on cotton? She's not specific. Welcome to Reps. You got to get on both sides, both records. I mean, I'm not an engineer, so I don't answer that question. I really don't know. That's up to them. They're the ones that might open the envelopes.

Any discussion on the motion? Send out letter. All in favor? Aye. Opposed? Motion carried. Another one? Yeah. The next communication, what I'd like to do is send it to Chris Cool Crawley of DPW CCD administration. Chris had mentioned a while back that he was David Grant city. We're going to look into that area where the boundary brewery is. Mill Street, Garrity, Cedar Brook, etcetera. He wanted to wait for a response from Dot first before the city went in and looked into those streets to see if there were any signage that could be done to alleviate traffic issues. So we've now got the response from the state. So what I'd like to do is have communications at the MCC administration. And certainly forward him a copy of the response from the state here in IML. And then have him moving forward. If he could go in there, in those streets in the back of the boundary brewery. And try to come up with some sort of plan for signage. And whatever the recommendation is going to be to alleviate the traffic situation. And what I'll do is I'd like to have some sort of input response from Chris and or the administration by the second meeting in May 2. Mike Council Moreno plan for signage in the area between boundary brewery and that general city will traffic congestion resulting from the traffic signal. And not as important. And then the question is for response by the 7th meeting in May. Any discussion? All in favor? Did you mention that you had something else about Newport Avenue? Oh, yeah, that's true too. Yeah. In doing my research and actually driving down Newport Avenue as well. I know that we don't mind, council president. I know it's just area. But what I'd like to do, we could actually investigate to Lexis Galvano to include. I know that the state was supposed to be working on Newport Avenue. In the vicinity of Columbus Avenue. Going towards East Providence line. But it appears that really hasn't been done for days. If we can get an update on that. We'll see. So he's talking about Newport avenues. From about Columbus Avenue to the city Miami surprise. If we can get a status on that dot had repaid much of it kind of stopped at slightly before I think Columbus happened. And especially the south bound lanes. You're right as Trojan. So if we can just amend. Everyone's agreeable to that. Amending the original communication from this galve. I request that they revisit finishing repaving what avenues from Columbus Avenue to the East Providence Fund. All right, thank you, Ronnie. Item three. Item number three.

Is there any discussion on the resolution? Yes. President Marsdom, the deputy director of land, came and gave us a synopsis of what this does. This $20 million is put into DPW for streets, sidewalks, free program. The 50 50 program. In years past it was put into individual programs. And this here makes it where it's various programs, and explain this appropriately. It's made it so it's a little bit broader so that we can get the biggest bang out of the buck. So if there's any questions that the council may have of this, they can ask the director Welsh, the deputy director Welshman chair, or if that's enough, they kind of let you know that the committee voted to approve it. The recommendation, just clarification. Some of our newer members and I know councillor Rubio sat through the committee meeting as well. But this is a resolution so that we can put get it before the General assembly for approval to put it on the November ballot. Relative to bond organization by the right, that's current. We're talking about current. Previously used to be four or five questions that said traffic signals and sidewalks and curves and whatever else. Now it's going to one bigger bond authorization to be used for those similar things. Just not your last. Correct. Because Lept has indicated that other grant monies have come in and then we've been kind of pigeonholed because we've asked for money in a certain amount and only been able to spend it on that, that one project because it was put that way, this way here, expanded out again. You want to help explain? I want to make sure I'm explaining it appropriately and to say that it makes, it gives the DPW and the administration more flexibility in this project the way it's funded. Director, how are you? I'm good, thanks. Good, thank you. Did he explain it well or. Yes. The primary reason for doing this, lump sum, as the councilor said, it's the flexibility of allowing us to be able to identify as we go along what the main project is for DPW, what the funding needs are going to be. So if we get some funding from the federal government for sidewalk improvements, we are not going to be limited by having a certain amount of funding for sidewalk improvements in this. We can just put that for street space or something else, or traffic devices or whatever the case. Yes. Okay. Any questions? Yeah, this does a lot of things in the park and everything else. It would be nice to have some sort of understanding how much money is being allocated to certain things, which areas are being addressed. So these would be, it would be for cpu projects. I don't know if you'd be able to speak to some of the more specifics, but I think the word had been mentioned. 50 50 program. Tree. Tree skate program. Right. So normally we always, when we're going, the voters decline and we have to go through the General assembly for what we've got kind of backed out timeline to get an approved by the General assembly in order for us to be able to put it on. Normally there's two or three or four requests with, let's just say $5 million for screenshots, $5 million for traffic, $5 million. But what they're telling us is that by doing it that way, we're pivoting where that money should go. And $2 million of federal grant money comes for something. We wouldn't be able to use that additional 2 million from this pot to perhaps some of streetscape recreation, traffic signals. Is that something with. Yeah, so it's. I don't like the word big, but it's done in catchment in this way. And that's what you kind of umbrella. Right. And you explain that always in the committee. Right. I mean, how do we know things, certain areas of the city, and I've been saving over others while I just being ignored. You have a blank check that you can essentially use anywhere you want well, these are the projects that DPW already has on their agenda that they, they're already aware of. It's just if they need funding for the project that they're working on is also, for instance, structure. So it really is kind of up to what DPW is going to be working on next. All the projects every single year we put together capital improvements and we submit the administration and everything like that. And that is what we are planning on doing. So we have it broken down by Stewart highway, pagan recreation, traffic and it's all different areas. So it could be $1 million a year for John street playground, for splash pads, something like that. So that's, that money that we're looking to borrow that particular year would go towards that project. It could be like Matt Reed, all the different fields. It'd be Wally Field. Right. I mean, if the council and whatever goes on with all that background stuff that we're not involved in. Yes. If money could go towards. But it would be listed in the capital improvement program. So that would be available all the councils to review. Correct. Every year we put together what we're planning on doing the next fiscal year and it's just a plan. It is not 100%, because I know things change daily, but we do put together what we're looking to borrow from bonds and what projects, those projects that money being used for, what the money is supposed to go towards take up projects.

It's a resolution authorizing mayor we execute a sublease agreement between the city and sleep in Heavenly Peace, Inc. For a portion of the property located at 183 platinum 23, lot number 553. Recommendation is for approval. Any discussion, counselor? So, sleep in heavenly piece actually builds beds for children three to 17. They're going to be using the garden space of the apex building for storage of sheets, things of that nature. You know, the lease clearly lays out, you know, their right, the landlord's right, bus being, you know, in case we need that building for future use, parking for events, things like that. But they're a great organization, so I'm happy that we can help them out. They built the bed. Do they take donated older beds or moving down repurpose? Yeah, positively, yes, I did. Yeah. They build beds for children who are in need of beds. It's a great program, actually, from what I see. And there are children indeed, in this city and other cities as well. And so they provide for wood, they build the beds, sheets, etcetera. So this is where children who, you know, can't afford to have a bed if the family can't have it, you know, they can look into this and possibly get a bed through this organization, because they look like it's delivered to their homes and they can sleep a restful, nice and uncomfortable bed, which no children child should be without. And unfortunately, children out there in our city and upper. So they're doing great work on what I could read on the pamphlet.

That first passage through will be given to importance and amendment in chapter 116 four. The code of ordinance received 1996. Entitled impoundment fees. Just refer to that, President Meister. Thank you. These fees haven't been changed in about 20 years. Some. The introduction of a new fee, a pickup fee, will help with the running of the animal shelter. But the other fees will turn around and treat them towards the welfare of the animals that they've taken care of. So this is a much needed change. Again, I said in the past, the fee that we charge right now is $5. This increases it to ten people could turn around and board their dogs cheaper at the animal shelter than they could with professional water. So I think this is a long time coming.

If you're here for public input for the city property committee, please raise your hand by using the raised hand feature at the bottom of your screen. I'm sure I see none. Okay, that's region number two. Please. Want me to take two and three at the same time. All right, so item number two is a communication from Susan L. Reid, library director, to Richard J. Goldstein, MMC, city clerk, lease renewal for library parking. I'd like to make a motion to file that communication. All right, it's been movement. Councilor Rugio. Second, by Councilor Moreno, that we file a communication from Susan L. Reed, library director, to Richard J. Goldstein, LLC, city clerk lease renewal for library parking. All in favor of filing that communication? All right, number three is a resolution authorizing the city of Pawtucket to enter into a one year lease extension agreement with Nexus Property Management, LLC for the use of the parking lot on Summer street and 49 North Union Street, AP 43 lot 629 and a one year lease agreement with Core Collaborative LLC for use of the parking lot at 217 Main Street AP 43 lot 594 and the Pawtucket Public Library. A motion is to take up or approve the resolution. Second. All right, so it's a motion to take up the resolution authorizing the city of Pawtucket to enter into a one year lease extension agreement with Nexus Property Management, LLC for one of, for use of the parking lot on Summer street and 49 North Union Street. AP 43 lot 629 and one year lease agreement with core Collaborative LLC for use of the parking lot at 217 Main Street AP 43 lot 594 for the Pawtucket Public Library. Roll call or just all in favor? No, we're going to take it up. We're going to talk to Miss Reed. So, Miss Reed, just before you speak, I did talk to Councilor Miles, who had a conflict and couldn't come. So he did say, I just want to let my colleagues know that the lease for the Union street is absolutely the same and the one for the new space, he really used the same sort of lease. So the leases are something we have seen before in the previous years. Go ahead, Masride. Okay. Well, we want to continue our relationship with Nexus, but we understand that in the future they might be developing the building and we might not have access to that. So we've been looking for some other property that we could use in the future. And so I reached out to core collaboratives, and this is the parking lot behind the black charismatic building, and they have all six, and they were interested in working with it. We thought we'd start in a small way with six spaces and see what happened. So that's our plan. So is it your hope that once nexus sort of completes their development and you might lose those spaces, that core collaboratives might grow into spaces, more spaces efforts, that we would be able to replace the leases for 13 states and the Nexus lot so that we could add to it? And of course, we could use many more spaces than the 13, but, you know, that's what we're looking at right now. Awesome. And are you looking for any other, are there any other proactive places you're looking at just in case? No, nothing that we're aware of, unfortunately, yeah, there's not a lot. Any questions? Yeah, so with this, well, obviously Nexus we've had a longstanding relationship with, and they've been very good, so. But with the core collaborative, that's the new entity for us to look at. Right. Okay. And hopefully to build that olive branch. Cause, yeah, I remember even a couple of years ago speaking about Nexus maybe doing something different with the property, and they've been great with holding the line on the lease payment. Lease agreement. And is it those parking spots? Are they for both employees and visitors of the library? They're just for visitors. Okay, great. Awesome. And will you guys have to put up signs that say specific? Yeah, I have to talk to DPW about that. Okay. Any other questions? No. Okay, we'll take a motion. I'll make a motion to approve the resolution and send it to the council with a recommendation for approval. Sorry. So it's been moved by Councilor Russo, seconded by Councilor Moreno, that we approve the resolution with a recommendation to the full council authorizing the city of Pawtucket to enter into a one year lease extension agreement with Nexus Property Management, LLC for use of the parking lot on Summer street and 49 North Union street, and also a one lease, a one year lease agreement with core collaborators, LLC for the use of the parking lot at 217 Main street.

So I see that we have a couple of people joining us online. If anybody's here for public input, if you could raise your hand by using the raise hand feature at the bottom of your screen. Get anybody here for public input, Mister President? I see none. We'll wait just a minute. Yep, she was just asking for people online. All right, let's see here. Good evening, everyone. Welcome to Pawtucket City hall council chambers. The first thing on our agenda tonight is the annual report from the chief of police. It's given in February of every year, excuse me. To look back at the previous year and a look ahead for goals for the upcoming year. So, chief, if you'd like to step forward. Good evening, everybody. So, as you know, the annual report formally will be done probably sometime the end of March, beginning of April. We'll direct a copy to your attention, and also we'll put it online so you can find it on the Pawtucket police website. So just some of the stuff that we've been doing last year. And this year we will be receiving our reaccreditation for RIpac, which is our accreditation format, in March of this year, and that'll be good for the next three years in January of 2024. We also went before the post, the Rhode island post, to get certification for our special response team. So that has been certified by the post. And it also had its first call out in February, which resulted in a successful surrender for the police department. So that was a big deal. We haven't had an SRT team for quite some years because of budgetary concerns. We were able to bring it back last year. They had to train for the whole year last year, and they had to meet certain, almost certain criteria and certain benchmarks before we could go to the post in January for our certification. So I'm glad to say that was successful. And we now have a fully staffed SRT team. Some of the events that we're going to be doing in the future with our community policing unit will do our Earth Day like we normally do in April of this year. We do our national prescription take back. Also in April. We're going to have our St. Patrick's Day parade here in March, our annual award ceremony and promotional ceremony in May, national night out in August. Obviously, we have our backtrack drives for the schools in community back in August and September. We partner with a lot of local businesses and community groups to be able to bring backpacks and school supplies to our kids within the community. We do trunk a treat, which is fully staffed by the police department. We also invite other community organizations. We invite other businesses to come in, and we're able to do that through fundraising that we do for our canine events. So we put that on through the police department at no cost, obviously, to the city. And it's kind of just a way that we give back to the kids in the community. We also assist in the turkey baskets in November. And then our big event for the year is always our canine event in December, which is also a big event that we participate in, where at Slater park, we have our canines go out Santa, we have the Grinch. We have buddy the elf this year, and we're able to give toys to kids in the community that come out and visit us for the day. We talk to them about policing. We show them different events. Our explorer program has been ongoing now for several years. We do that every Tuesday night. And what that is, is we try to get kids that are interested in law enforcement. We try to give them an inside view into what it is to be a police officer in the city of Pawtucket. We have volunteers for the police department that teach them and coach them every Tuesday, and we do it for Pawtucket Central Falls, and we even do Cumberland sometimes because they don't have an explorers program. So if a community doesn't have an explorers program, we allow the kids to come into the city and. Excuse me, like I said, every Tuesday night we kind of go over all the things it is to be a police officer, and we do that from 14 to 20 years old in the hopes that we can get them to join the police department once they have matured to that age. Currently, we have five police officers enrolled in the academy with one additional transfer, just like every place else in the state of Rhode island. Unfortunately, we're having a hard time recruiting police officers currently, so our numbers right now, with those academy and additional transfers will bring us about 155. So that's probably where I was when we started 25 years ago. It's probably about the same number. So although we'd like to increase the numbers, it's a difficult time trying to recruit. We did. Last year, we established a recruitment team for the city of Pawtucket and the Pawtucket Police department.

So that's probably where I was when we started 25 years ago. It's probably about the same number. So although we'd like to increase the numbers, it's a difficult time trying to recruit. We did. Last year, we established a recruitment team for the city of Pawtucket and the Pawtucket Police department. And what this recruitment team does is it kind of monitors social media. It tries to interact with people that are interested in policing, and it also establishes a connection with kids that really don't know what the next step are. So if we find out that they're interested, we put them together with a recruiter the recruiter will walk them through the process, kind of hold their hand, kind of get them to where they need to be. We also participate in a lot of the college fairs. We go out to the college fairs again, see if they're interested in policing, and we also do it to the fit to serve. We attend all their events and get a list and kind of help them walk through it. Just kind of makes a connection between a potential candidate and a recruiter that kind of follows them through the process. It's been successful. We've had a lot of people come back, give us positive reviews. So we're going to continue to do that for as long as it's, like I said, successful. So additional service that we have now, we also have a gateway clinician that has been assigned to the police department at no cost to the city. They work through gateway. They're involved in our mental health cases. They come out with police offices. She also follows up after. If we have any cases with mental health issues, she'll follow up. She has the ability to certify people medically, so that kind of helps us. And she's also going to be assisting also with the fire department in the future. We also have our Go team, which assists victims of traumas. So we put out go team members where if we have a major incident in the city, they'll go out. They offer services to victims. They also can provide crisis intervention, and they obviously can provide additional services if need be. And I'm not sure if you're aware, but we always had a domestic violence advocate in the station five days a week. She worked for us through Blackstone Valley, but she was stationed in Pawtucket because of restrictions with the budget. Federally. With that, we have to now share one with Central Falls. We do have one in house right now, which is great. She's there three days a week, and she follows up with any kind of domestic related issues that we may have. And she has access to the court system, so she works hand in hand with the court. And the one big thing that we've been kind of circling around and lease purchase, obviously, we have our cars. We're kind of in the process of that, but unfortunately, sometimes with. Because of COVID we're still waiting. Sometimes it takes us a whole year to get ten cars for a fleet, which is kind of crazy, but that's kind of where we are right now. But, and like I said, the annual report officially for all the departments should be done by the end of March, the beginning of April. Anybody have any questions to the chief, it's back on. Go ahead. Okay, perfect. You had said that we're at 155, and you would like to see that increase. If in a perfect world, what number would you want it to be at? So. Right, like I said, 155 is where I was when I started 25 years ago. So our numbers did decrease. We were in the 130s for quite a while. We were able to get back up to 155. It would be nice to be at that. 165, 170. It is a lot about recruiting and retention. We don't have a lot of offices that leave Pawtucket to go to other communities, but we do have offices that either decide that policing is not for them any longer, which is something that we've never faced before, or they decide that, you know, they've moved away from home and they want to go back. But we are losing some to other communities, especially Massachusetts, just because, you know, the pays in Massachusetts is completely different than Rhode island structure. So it's about retaining and then recruiting. Like, our numbers are low across the whole state, and we're all recruiting for the same pool of candidates. Councilor Gregor. Good evening, chief. Thank you for coming here and doing the report. My question is just in regards to the new recruits and the ones that are currently in the academy, how many of those are people of color? Women. So as we stand right now, we have at least 15% of our. Close to 20% of our whole department is minorities, including women. And people of color, also Hispanic and Latino, too. So we have a very diverse department, and we continue to kind of go to places like Uri, where is a more diverse population of students that we can pull from. We also try to recruit in the high schools, Thoman and Shea, because we have, as you know, a very diverse population in the city itself. So our goal is, obviously to pull the kids from the city to get them interested in law enforcement. And that's why we started the explorers program, to kind of get them at that 14 years old when they're 14 to 20, when they have that interest, and kind of get them to, I guess, kind of mature into the world of policing, or kind of keep that interest into the world of policing. Okay, that sounds great.

Women. So as we stand right now, we have at least 15% of our. Close to 20% of our whole department is minorities, including women. And people of color, also Hispanic and Latino, too. So we have a very diverse department, and we continue to kind of go to places like Uri, where is a more diverse population of students that we can pull from. We also try to recruit in the high schools, Thoman and Shea, because we have, as you know, a very diverse population in the city itself. So our goal is, obviously to pull the kids from the city to get them interested in law enforcement. And that's why we started the explorers program, to kind of get them at that 14 years old when they're 14 to 20, when they have that interest, and kind of get them to, I guess, kind of mature into the world of policing, or kind of keep that interest into the world of policing. Okay, that sounds great. I just had a question in terms of the college visits. Yes. Do you do any attempts at, like, CCri? Yes. Okay. So we actually. I believe it's the end of March this year. CCRI has reached out to ask if I'll go speak with Colonel Robinson from Central Falls at a career fair at CCRI. So not only will I go, but there'll also be other members from the department that will go set up a table and kind of. We do the career fairs. As you know, Wilder was at CCRI for a little while, so he used to give us a heads up on, like, career fairs coming in. So we would set up a table for the police department to go in so people could kind of have a conversation with them. We do brochures and now, like I said, videos and stuff so we can interact with them right there on campus. Okay. As long as the schools will have us, we'll. We'll. We'll go. Not good, because I just figured, like, CCR would be places where you would be most likely to find minorities, and people are not going to four years going into the high schools, especially here in the city. I mean, that is the most diverse population. We can get their kids from the city who live in the city. They have an understanding of the city. They've lived here usually since birth, so they kind of understand the city and where it's going. So it's nice to be able to draw those kids at 14 to get them interested in explorers. And because we have a 30 credit requirement for policing, you know, we work with them with that, too, after high school, like, okay, what are your next steps? Where do you want to go? What do you want to do? So it kind of gives us an insight to start, you know, at such a young age. That's great with the high schools, because I was at the school committee last week, and I were talking about all these issues happening at home in particular. So some of those kids. Right? And we. And we do have an SRO. Like, you know, we have the SRO still in the school. And then plus, like I said, we do the explorers for them. And if you've ever noticed that some of the events we go to, you'll see the explorers because they volunteer as part of the program. So they'll volunteer on the different community events we have. And sometimes community members will reach out and say, hey, we're doing this in the neighborhood. Do you have anybody to bring? And we'll have, obviously, a police officer with our volunteers, with our explorers that will go help out with all the community events. That's great. Um, just real quick, um, will you be speaking in terms of the fire department as well, or. No. Uh, no. Today was just for, um, the annual report for police, but I saw the chief come in, so I can throw him under the bus. No problem. But if you have. If he needs any assistance, I can be there to help him. Sure. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. So this was just the annual report that's required by, by ordinance of the police chiefs. Do you have a specific question that the fire chief is here? Do you have a question or you just. Well, in your capacity as director of public safety. So I just figured does the fire department also do some sort of annual report to the council as well, or. No, it's not required by order. Okay. All right. Now I'm just curious in terms of recruiting in the fire department, because I know fire department's pretty low in terms of minorities and. Yes. So we are in the middle of a process right now, and we are trying to develop ways so that the fire department can kind of latch on to the police department and kind of follow the process that we're doing. The chief is aware of kind of the barriers that we face in recruiting, so he's looking to kind of do the same things in the schools, the same thing he's working with the school department to kind of put up. It's almost, it's almost like the explorers program, but it kind of gives kids in the high schools exposure to the fire department and kind of gets them on that path if they want to be firefighters in the future. So he's working with that in the high schools, and also he's going to be doing career fairs and stuff like the, at the colleges also. So he is aware of the barriers that are faced with the fire department, and he is looking to kind of change up the recruiting process there also. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. That accurate? Chief, anybody on this side have any questions to the chief? Chief, I had one quick question mentioned five in the academy right now and a transfer from different police department, I assume Maryland. Yes. Has to go back through the municipal academy. So with a transfer, they have to be post certified. So in Rhode island, they're all pro certified. We're under the same kind of restrictions, regulations. So if we were to have a candidate from Rhode island to transfer to different departments, they would only have to go through an internal training where they would learn Pawtucket's policies and procedures. But if we get a candidate from outside the state and they are post certified, they do not ha", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Police Department", "insights": [{"observation": "Close to 20% of our whole department is minorities, including women and people of color, also Hispanic and Latino.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We continue to go to places like Uri and high schools with diverse populations for recruitment.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Started the explorers program to get kids interested in law enforcement from 14 to 20 years old.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Fire Department", "insights": [{"observation": "Fire department's pretty low in terms of minorities.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Developing ways to follow the police department's recruitment process, including working with schools and having an explorers-like program.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Police Department", "insights": [{"observation": "Close to 20% of our whole department is minorities, including women and people of color, also Hispanic and Latino.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We continue to go to places like Uri and high schools with diverse populations for recruitment.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Started the explorers program to get kids interested in law enforcement from 14 to 20 years old.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Fire Department", "insights": [{"observation": "Fire department's pretty low in terms of minorities.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Developing ways to follow the police department's recruitment process, including working with schools and having an explorers-like program.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1707580, "chunk_end_time": 2057162, "base_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240221&iCurrentPosition=6314", "chunk_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240221&iCurrentPosition=1707"}, {"start": 19000, "end": 25000, "text": "high schools, and also he's going to be doing career fairs and stuff like the, at the colleges also.

And then they would come to us for, like, our internal policies and procedures. If it's not post certified, then, yes, they have to go through the whole academy. So it kind of depends where that background is. But that's six total or five. Five in the academy with the transfer. So six. Okay, so when they come on, how quickly before those five are able to ride on their own, patrol on their own and put the 6th one from Maryland, is he more likely to be. So he should be done ride alone sooner. He should be ready and done by, I believe, April from the academy. And then he'll go on probably a smaller training and fto just to kind of get him familiar with Pawtucket, Pawtucket streets, Pawtucket policies. And if he picks up quicker than normal, then he would be able to go on the road sooner. But normally when we have a recruitment process, those recruits, it almost a whole year, probably ten to twelve months before they actually go out on their own. So it's almost a whole year turnaround before we see them out on their road working by themselves. Yeah. With the tro, those that first twelve months, give or take. Well, between the academy and then they go for the ftos for their training and then we do the shadow phase and then they're on their own. So, like this group right now won't graduate until May and probably the end of August or September is when we'll see them out on their own. Thank you. Anybody else? Castle? Just one quick follow up. In terms of the five that currently in the academy and the transfer, what's the composition of that group? So I believe the five that we have in the academy. I'd have to double check because I was going to say the last, we had the last group, we had two white males. This group is all males, but I believe we have one minority in the group. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay. I think we're good, chief. I think this new timeframe of doing it in February as opposed to, I think was August. Yes. Lends itself to a better presentation. So. And like I said, the full report will be. Should be done without about the end of March, beginning April. Perfect. Thanks very much. You're welcome. You're welcome. That brings us to public input, I believe, and we have one individual in person signed up and I believe no one online. So we have one individual, John Jarromelo from West Carpenter street. If you could just come forward. You don't need his name. You've got it here. Right. So just step to the podium and tell us what's on your mind. I appreciate the opportunity to address you today. My presence here stems from a concerns raised during a recent subcommittee hearing last week for the ad hoc meeting at the appointment of the next city magistrate. At this hearing, I posed two questions to the subcommittee. Questions which unfortunately seem to have been overlooked. I have condensed these inquiries for clarity. First, was the is the city council committed to considering the appointment of a bilingual, experienced minority candidate for magistrate to accurately reflect the rich diversity of Pawtucket? Given that it's about 30% spanish speaking population? This question underscores the present need for our city's judiciary to mirror the community it serves. Secondly, does the council share concerns regarding John Gagnet's candidacy for magistrate, given his controversial past and legal entanglements, which may present a conflict of interest? In addition, it is common knowledge that council member Clovis Greger is a random licensed attorney with extensive legal expertise. He seems like an obvious choice to lead the review of candidates for a legal position such as city magistrate. It is a matter of leveraging expertise. What is more most appropriate, a principle that seems to make more common sense. Instead of assigning the newest members of the council with zero legal experience to the subcommittee to make, the council president refers to as a simple appointment. This simple appointment, as referred to by the city council president this morning's valley briefs article required, requires candidates to not only go through a rigorous academic pursuit, take and pass the bar exam, practice law for a period of three years, and then submit the resume for the simple appointment. The simple appointment to the people's court, a position paid for by the taxpayer dollars to dispense justice and work for our residents, is a far cry from a simple appointment. In March 2017, which I have here, the city council initiated a search for legal advisor during which three candidates were interviewed and assessed based on their job performance and character. This raises a question. If a legal advisor undergoes a thorough vetting and evaluation process similar to that for a magistrate position, why does the simple appointment to a magistrate role not receive an equal level of scrutiny?

This raises a question. If a legal advisor undergoes a thorough vetting and evaluation process similar to that for a magistrate position, why does the simple appointment to a magistrate role not receive an equal level of scrutiny? During the deliberation of the subcommittee hearing, instances of last week, nepotism was noted. Discussions about the qualification of candidates were overshadowed by personal stories and relationships. For example, one member favored a candidate based on familiarity with their family and noted the candidates parental status of this as of this was a revelant qualification for this role, once again undermine the qualification that it takes to be a simple magistrate. At no point did the subcommittee members engage in discussions regarding the other candidates experience, their legal experience, expertise, or their performance during interviews. A matter of fact, no candidate was interviewed. The subcommittee members directly proceeded to express their preference for specific candidates which appear to be influenced by nepotism rather than the candidates qualifications and experience. This brings me to the broader issue question in these practices currently being applied to this role should I apply for a position at any organization, be it McDonald's, Walmart, or Google, et cetera? I would rather expect the vetting process to be based on merit, including an interview to assess my qualifications. Why then, when it comes to filling this appointment as city magistrate, a role you as council members, should regard with great anticipation, or the candidates not subjected to a similar process of scrutiny and evaluation? Moreover, council members I have here, and I could pass along, I have before me the Rhode Island Municipal Court judge list, updated as of January, 2024, which prematurely lists Mister Jack Canyon as chief judge, effective February 20, 2024. If we're supposed to be appointing magistrates today, why does it look like the decision was already made a month ago behind doors? This premature announcement ahead of the council's former decision making process cast a shadow of doubt on the integrity of our city's governance, suggesting a predetermination that undermines the public's trust. In conclusion, I urge the council to seriously reflect on these concerns. Will we adhere to principles of fairness, diversity, and integrity in our judicial appointments? Or will we allow outdated practice of all school politics, where it matters who you know, rather than what the city deserves to dictate our decisions? And the answer to this question will not only affect the immediate appointments, but also the trust and respect of the Pataki community at large. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Jarmell.

Gregor, do you have any questions on this at the moment, or how do you want to handle this? Well, I'm just curious where the transferors are. They rarely action for them. I didn't hear the question. He was wondering where the transfer or is. Yeah. We've provided them notice. Provided notice to their attorney, attorney Michael Horan, but they didn't show up. Generally speaking, when we get a transfer like this, it's assumed that transfer or is indeed in favor of transferring and selling for the purposes. Correct. Have you had a closing yet or is. No, no, we're waiting. There's bank. There's a bank financing involved, subject to getting the license transferred. Once the license is transferred simultaneously, we'll have the closing with Rockland Trust. And the application is filled out by both parties, correct? Correct. The application signed by both parties. So they're fully aware that they're entering into a transfer process? Absolutely. Been working with their attorney for months now. Okay. Thank you, council. I guess before we go, you heard us enter in three letters of objection for four different beverage companies. Correct. You understand that if the transfer is approved, it would be contingent upon satisfactory satisfying those liens, for lack of a better term. We'll notify the attorney for the seller tomorrow morning. Sure. They're aware of that. Okay. Castle. Gregor. Well, I mean, can you tell us a little bit about your experience running a liquor store? Owning a liquor store. She doesn't own a liquor store. This would be her first. You can only have one. Can have multiple liquor stores. So give her background or education? Background. So, I have a bachelor's degree from MCPHs. I currently actually work at Mass general in the research department. I do liver disease research, but it's a family business, and my brother has had a liquor store for many years now. So all of my experience comes from his liquor store. With all the ins and outs of business and how to run the business, pretty much everything from there. Family businesses over the years while going to school and being a student. And now professional and in Lenity's objection. I would prefer to have the transferor here, as well. I've done dozens of liquor license hearings over 30 years, and I've never had the transfer or attend ever. That maybe it's my experience. I've never had them attend because they sign a license application. They're aware of it, so I've never had occasion to have them. I'm not sure what. It's not. It's not the norm here. Either. I'm just. Okay. License would not be issued till all of those claims are satisfied. We get a letter from those who saying that they're satisfied. So there tonight and we don't get those, we don't get those releases. And also we need to get tax plans for the seller which they are working with the tax division to obtain. I don't believe the clearance has been issued. We can't obviously transfer a liquor license until the tax clearance is received by the clerks office. So they're working on that. I've been talking to their attorney. That's part of the agreement. It's part of the law that we have to provide, but the seller has to tax. So I know my experience with the city talking to other cities. The cities will not issue a liquor license until we receive tax clearance on the sellers. I don't have any other questions.

I've been talking to their attorney. That's part of the agreement. It's part of the law that we have to provide, but the seller has to tax. So I know my experience with the city talking to other cities. The cities will not issue a liquor license until we receive tax clearance on the sellers. I don't have any other questions.

So, Mister Montero, you're looking for licenses for two events on consecutive nights this weekend. Yes. The 23rd, to hold a turn up Rhode island fundraiser. 24. And with that, a class f one full privilege. And then the following night, request for a class f one full privilege to host a birthday party. Yes. Does that mean you'll be hosting a birthday party for yourself? No, I don't think it's a 30th birthday party. Right? That's long. No, it's for a woman. She's turning 35. You don't remember her name, so you're hosting a birthday, a 30th birthday party for. Some of you don't remember her name and you intend to sell alcoholic beverages at this. And the night before you'd like to sell alcoholic beverages at a. Is it a fundraiser or. It says friend up. Rhode island is. They do a youth program. Kobe, Jwan. Kobe, Dennis and Jwan. They go to the school and give backpacks, computers, everything. And once a year he raises money for this event. So you're from Providence, right? On the east side. What made you choose 249 Main street as your. As where you'd like to host the. Well, because I have the pizza place across the street and that one was over there, aerial. And we went in because he was losing his face. My brother is his manager, so we kind of built him up, so we kind of got stuck with it. Gotcha. Um, but he. Yeah, it's a beautiful state. You're across the street and you. Forgive me. You have the pizza place. The pizza still on. Still on Main. Is that what it's called? Yes. Okay, um, remind me, do you have a liquor license? Yes. You do. And who would be still on Main has it in the name of still on Main. Is that correct? Yes. Not James Montero. Okay, council Cody, did you have any questions? This is your district? Yes. Hi, Mister Montero, how are you? The only thing that I have to say is that every time that I go to downtown. I see. I visit all the businesses, and I like the way you run your business, Mister Montero. I have never had any issues, and I have no problem on proving this license. I think we do still need to hear from the captain. The police department articulated some concerns, some ongoing concerns relative to both sides of Main street and the properties and the disparity in licenses and how they're being used. So if you could just sit tight for a moment and, captain, if you could come forward, please. Yeah, right. Right in the front. Fine. Good evening. Good evening, captain. We just got this and just filed it. Can you kind of paraphrase exactly what it says and what the concerns of the police department are? Yes. So we were. It came to our attention that there was an event being advertised for 249 Main street. The event had sold tickets. They sold a bunch of tickets. They were already advertising it. There was going to be a dj battle. Everything pointed to the fact that this was going to be a fairly large event with alcohol being served. There was a 249 Main street. They never applied for a license. What night was that? I mean, what was that night supposed to be? That was last Friday, the 16th. Sounds about right. So on the 16th, there were no licenses applied for. We found out about it.

So on the 16th, there were no licenses applied for. We found out about it. The clerk's office tried to reach out and say, you can't have this event without having a license, without applying for one. My understanding was that there was no response given about trying to cancel this event that had these tickets sold. So we went out, the fire department's here. They went out beforehand as well to do it, and they happened to do an inspection. My understanding is that they had deficiencies in the inspection which made it so they weren't able to have an occupancy for an event like they were having last Friday. So we went to make sure that it was not happening there, because if it was, then it was going to be just like India street, where it's unsafe. I think today is station night, club fire anniversary. So it's all very prevalent for Rhode island. We went last week, and they ended up moving the event. They put up sign up on the door, said, I think that was uprise PBD. We're not here. We're agreeing on Main. We're at 230 Main street. They held the same event down the street at Candy's apprentice, held it again. Still, they didn't apply for a license. They were selling liquor in there. They tried to claim it was a private event, but you could buy tickets to that one online as late as four or 05:00 the day of the event. So it wasn't private and said for this to still be at 2.9 Main street. And the fire department stated, talk about it. My understanding is that it still is not set for occupancy for events like these. And that's today, Wednesday, for Friday and Saturday. Correct. You said that the one that you were concerned about at 249, that could not go off, and the clerk's office told the property owner, Leslie, the property owner, that that could not happen and needed to be canceled. Yes. And they were supposed to advertise it canceled as well and didn't. Didn't get back to the clerk's office. It wasn't essentially canceled. And then all they did was put a sign up and said, moving across the hall, across the street to another location that also did not have a license. No, they did not. And they were selling alcohol beverages without a license for that as well. Yes. Okay. Is that it? Is that it from your end on that? For me, I was able to flag this just based on the fact that that address and knowing that the fire department previously stated that they couldn't have an event there. My understanding is that hasn't changed. My understanding being here tonight is that hasn't changed. And to approve a license for a structure to hold an event that's going to have more people than normal or more people at the occupancies even approved for would just be negligent. To say, you can't have people in the seat, you can't have people here, but here's your license to have people. Right. And it shouldn't be moved across the street either. I certainly hope not, because like I said, that was. That's a whole nother issue. Probably for another night when we can talk about this and the whole issue of 230 Main street, but yet. Then just say, we're not having 249 now. It's a 230, so now it's okay. It's not. Well, it's still not licensed either way. Correct. Okay, thank you. Rather than take your word from it, chief or whoever, could you just come up and give us the fire marshals perspective on this building? Good evening. So currently we have eight deficiencies. They're not huge deficiencies for 249 Main. The biggest problem is he is. He sets himself up as a mercantile. That's what we've inspected him for. He says he sells artwork as, like, an art gallery. He being the landlord, Mister Montero. Okay. So he's been cooperative with us. What we needed, our members. Fire prevention had gone out there twice last week, explained to him, you can't have an assembly, which is, he was trying to do a private party for, I think his niece or there was somebody that was trying to do a party for. So we explained to him, you're only allowed to do the mercantile because that's what he's from us. That's what he's been inspected for. We heard the same stories that he wanted to do this private party or a few private parties. For him to do that. He doesn't have a license, which is not our issue. However, he's not allowed to have an assembly. For him to have these parties, he'd have to have an assembly inspection. So we'd have to go back in, reinspect the building, give him a quantity of people that are allowed to be in the building. He hasn't done that. He hasn't even asked us for that. Because he's still going with that. He's in a mercantile building. So my recommendation is until he gets inspected by the fire department for an assembly license or an assembly building, he shouldn't be hosting any parties. I guess I'm a little confused. He's looking for a license, but he doesn't own. Miss Montero, do you lease that property? Do you have a long term lease for. That property can be used as a mercantile establishment, but it's not. It's not proper to utilize it for a. An assembly is what you're saying. Correct. We'd have to go back in and reinstate.

So it's a totally different type of an inspection. We'd have to go out, we'd measure the building, decide whether he's having tables and chairs, if not, if it's just going to be all freestanding each. The way that it's occupied gives him a different number of capacity. So we'd have to come back out. If he decides he wants to switch over to do an assembly, we'd have to come back out, inspect it as an assembly. Assembly building. And then we could give them all the proper information. If he has any deficiencies for that. And give him, we give him a piece of paper, a poster that basically says how many people he's allowed to have. Okay, thank you. Just 1 second. Do you have a question? Well, for Mister Monteiro, who is Jason Gervachio? You don't know? So this is the person that was hosting the party. This is the. This is the party that the police officer had to go. The one that is that was hosted by Jason, because this is, this is a different thing for Mister Monteiro. So even though this one had, even though we had an issue with this person, with this party. So I want to take this one as a different one. However, if the place is not, it's not completely legal for everything that it needs to. So he could have a party, then I will suggest to Mister Montero to follow all the steps that you have to do so that way you can have a party and then, you know, you won't have any issues. Okay, totally understand. Um, Bob, he did come in with the roller, right? And he did all that and everything that he gave me. I've been running around with physic and I've completed everything. He just hadn't come back. So he has, he's. All he's done is measured the building for. In case this, he wanted to apply for an assembly, we already have the measurements. We didn't have to actually get back into the building. He has the measurements. He would, it have to be determined how many tables he wants, how many chairs he wants, what's going to be in the actual building. Then we can give him a capacity number. When have you ever had this same discussion with Mister Montero about that property? No. The discussions we've had from my fire prevention people was that he was running it as an art gallery, which classified as a mercantile, and nothing was ever asked. As far as an assembly, it's not a big deal. We can go back out there and do that. As long as he just contacts fire prevention and says he wants to switch to an assembly. And then we'd have to go back. Like I said, we'd have to measure everything, go through the whole process again. All right, thank you, chief. I know. Councilman, do you have a question for the chief? Nope, for Mister Montero. Mister Martin, how long have these three events been on your books for? I'd say j one called me recently, but. 30th birthday party, hospital. Okay, and then when did you apply for these licenses? Last week. Okay, and then have you been advertising these events or has somebody been advertising these events before they were licensed? I advertised. Only thing I do is book the space. But you just applied for these for an abet this weekend? Yes. Councilor Rubio. Sorry, does that change any type of insurance policies for you and being able to host that event, that I'm not sure of that I know you're asking. I would suggest you looking into that, because that also means that it could change the layout of your insurance policy. And what it covers. Thank you, Council Gregor. Who actually owns the building there? Leslie Mall. I'm sorry? Leslie Moore. Okay. Is there any responsibility to the building owner to make sure these things are properly licensed? I'm sorry. I didn't want to wait for her, so I just did it. You didn't want to wait for her? What? To fix the stuff. Which stuff? All the privacy, all the deficiencies. Okay, I got you. Um, I share your frustration. This is very convoluted. Michelle, is there any way you can shed some light on this? Yes, if you would, please. So your name and. Oh, my gosh. So last meeting, we were debating whether to issue a license at 232 30 across the street. Yes. For an event that was widely advertised but not requested a license. Correct. And so that that event was advertised on Eventbrite as well as a couple of other sites. And when we saw that event was when we found out about the event that was to occur this past Friday at 249. At 249 across the street, both buildings owned by the same person? Yes. 230 has a number of different businesses in there, some with licenses. Correct. So that's the green on main, and that has the candy for pennies. And they've just applied for the fashion show that you approved this evening. But they do have a victualling house license. They do not have a liquor license, except that they do have a. The business owner has a catering license, so it's a class P liquor license from the state. What restrictions are on a class P? So a class P has to buy their alcohol. Did you say B or P as in Paul?

So a class P has to buy their alcohol. Did you say B or P as in Paul? Yes, that's right. So they have to buy their alcohol from a package store. Class A. There used to be a four hour license. They've expanded that. I believe it's now up to a 16 hours license, if I'm not mistaken. But it's licensed through the Department of Business regulations because it is a traveling anywhere in the state of Rhode island. Well, last week's event two weeks ago, we approved one begrudgement and we required, I think, three police details, correct? Correct. And to my understanding, those police officers were not paid. That's correct. And the next Friday, which came after between our meetings, so we couldn't entertain even if they had access. Right. You told the building owner, who happens to be the owner of both buildings. Correct? Correct. That it was an unlicensed event and it needed to be canceled. That's advertised that it was canceled. Yes. Did you hear back from her? I didn't. So I sent an email the week that I found out about the event, and I sent a follow up email the following week that, you know, I haven't heard from you, and I sent it to two different email addresses that I have for her, and I did not hear back from her, and I could not find. Who was it? Uprise PVD. They're not an entity, and so I could not find any contact information for that establishment. So then, lo and behold, the fire department stumbled upon Mister Montero there at the location at 249 Main street. During the day. Yeah. And referred him to come see me. Okay. Which we sat down and we spoke, and I told him that the event. I've been trying to get in touch with Leslie, the property owner, and that the event that was scheduled for the next night, because that was Thursday of last week, the event that was scheduled for Friday night could not take place because it did not have a license. Was Mister Montero involved in that event, or he just happened to be at 249, so he's the leaseholder there. So he leases it out to other people to host events. He subleases it. Yes, is my understanding. Okay, so in that. In that case, and sure, we can get the story from Mister Montero, but in that case, it was. It was an unlicensed event at 249, correct? And to cure that problem, they moved the unlicensed event across the street to. It was moved. I'm not suggesting you did it. I'm just saying that it was moved across the street to 230, correct? And alcohol was sold. Yes. And I had a conversation the week prior with Teresa from candy for pennies, who is subleasing her space at 230 Main street for the event. You begrudgingly approved that there could not be any events taking place that did not have a license. And I told Mister Montero there could not be any events taking place that did not have a license that was around the 16th, correct? One that we begrudgingly. And I emailed Leslie and told her there could not be any events that did not have a license. Yet. Following a Friday, an unlicensed event from 243 was moved across the street and went off without a hitch at 230, correct? Do we know? So the day after I spoke with Mister Montero, the event still took place, presumably with full liquor? Yes. I'm assuming through the catering that they have. We don't know that I have. I don't know that. There's no application on file. If. If we had not found out about it and moved it out of 249, would the liquor license, class P been allowed to be utilized across the street or only in so my understanding is that from the website for the 249 space is that they've been having events at that location back to March of last year without a license. None of the events have been licensed. None of the events have been licensed, and those events are still posted on their calendar on their website that they've rented it out for other events back to March of last year. And it's a little conf. I'm not sure exactly how there is a bar in a cash box that was observed at that location. It is advertised on their website as a bar that you could opt to have a bar. And I don't know of any liquor license at that location or any caterer that would be utilizing that location. And that's 249. That's 249. Anything else? That I not ask all the questions. I'm still a little confused, but anybody else have any questions for Michelle? I do. Thank you, Michelle, for putting this clear. I know about the Pixar, Mister Montero, and I was asked you too, Mister president. I was confused with the names and with the place and event. And that's what I wanted to say. I just wanted to rectify that. I'm clear now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Michelle. Just the pizza shop, is that the 230? That's 250 Main street. That's at the mall at 250 Main street. So this location is directly across the street from the pizza shop. 230 Main street is on the same side as the mall, just a few doors down. What exactly is 230? So 230 is the candy for pennies.

So for assembly, my understanding is, from talking to my fire prevention officer, is that I believe is also a mercantile. And she definitely, what I was told was she definitely could not have properly hosted that party because she does not have an assembly inspection. Okay, thank you, Michelle. Both properties, all three properties, 200, 3250, and 249, are owned by the same property owner. Property, correct? Correct. Does she hold any licenses? Any. She does. She holds a number of licenses in the mall. They're all under the four collaboratives, which is the business name, as well as she owned. Up until recently, she owned the gross little grocery mart store across the street, and she also owns the old Tavares newsstand. Which is block scoop, the ice cream shop. And she holds licenses at block scooped. And she did own block mart up until recently, but no liquor licenses. No liquor license. Or she does have victualling house. She does. The ice cream shop is a victualling house. She also had the backyard. Yes. Seriously? There was. Huh? No, seed is not hers. But there's also off punishment was a game room at that location. She's got a number of different businesses all under that. Under that mall at 250. All right. I'm still a little confused on how things are happening, how events are being advertised. Multiple and multiple. Multiple events being advertised without asking for a license. We're told you don't have a license for this. They just flip it across the street to a place where they still don't have a license for it. Utilize a different liquor license. The event that took place that you did approve for 230 Main street on your last agenda did have a fire detail that had to be present because, you know, it. I believe it's not set for that kind of occupancy. And it was the night of that event that they noticed people going in and out of 249, and that's why they stumbled upon it the next day. They wanted to go find out what's going on at 249. We got a lot of questions. Well, license chair. Yeah, license chair. But my question is, since the owner does have some. Like what? Is there a pathway to have her come before us somehow? Is there some sort of path that allows that for her to come before so we can clarify things? I think you could always invite her in to have a conversation. You know, it's. It's not necessarily her licenses that I've. But it's her. It's her buildings. Yeah. So I think you could. It would be an invitation I moved to. I was gonna. I thought you might do that. Constance, do you have a question? Yes. I'm just curious. How is it that this. These sort of things have been happening for almost a year now, and the police hasn't taken notice? Nobody's taken notices, haven't been brought up till just now, until. Until we were on those event websites, and there was supposed to be another event happening at Eston Avenue that had a cease and desist order. That event did not take place this past weekend, but that was also on the event websites. That's a different. That's a different space, but it's, you know, these things are being advertised and tickets are being sold. And the problem is that if the tickets are sold for an event that isn't once it's publicly posted, it's a public event. So if you're posting it on social media or on a website, you know, in selling tickets or not selling tickets, you're advertising it, it becomes a public event. It's no longer a bridal shower or birthday party or something of that nature. So these public events, they're selling many, many tickets. And without having the license or the knowledge of these events, it then could very, very seriously put our resources in danger. And I agree. I mean, I don't want to necessarily blame Mister Montero. I mean, he's leasing the place and he's, you know, if he thinks things are on the up and up. And events have been going on for over a year. I mean, but I did speak with Mister Montero on Thursday, and the event still took place Friday, which I was very disappointed after we had that conversation. Now, Mister Montero, if you didn't know, now you know. So you can, you can come up if you would, Mister Montero, just so we have the. I can't control whether this person, you can't come here if you walk across the street. I don't, I have nothing to do. I mean, so was the sign in the window of 249 that said go across the street, did you not see that sign in your own door? I didn't go there because we were shut down. I had no reason to be there. So he must have put the sign on there and directed them there. I have, I have no control over that. I didn't tell him to go down the street.

Have no control over that. That I do, and that's why when, Michelle, I'm sorry, I didn't tell. She says shut down, I cancel. And all I've been in there is making sure that all the issues are taken care of. Yeah, I know. Councilor Rouge, you had a question? Yeah. I mean, this has been going on too long. We just can't keep having unlicensed potties at a building. This has got to stop. We got to, we gotta, there's got to be a mechanism where we can have this stop and special event licenses. Am I correct, Michelle, that you are allowed twelve a year? Correct up to twelve. Right. So if you're gonna. There is not a limit on the number of special event licenses. There is a limit on the number of liquor licenses. So those class f one day licenses their state law caps that at no more than twelve per organization or location. And so, but the event licenses, there is no cap. So this has been going on for twelve months. I mean, even if they had a special liquor license for it, you know, I'd be hard pressed to think there was less than one a month that's been going on over there. Based on what I'm hearing. I don't have that data. I can't, you know, I'm just assuming. But this is the first we're hearing of this and mister president, there's got to be a mechanism for this. We have to put a stop to that. I agree. And again, I pointed out that it's up to twelve. We don't have to go to twelve. Right. Agree one. I have a zillion more questions, but we have other things to do. I absolutely agree with the chair of the licensing committee that we need to get our hands around this. So I think you're suggesting having the property owner. Yes, I'd like to have any license holder within those properties. Correct. Come in for a chat with your committee. Is that correct? Okay, no move. I'll talk to Rick about that. You can just end, that's not an improper proposition, correct. That they would come in because, I mean, at some point I think we're going to need to question whether or not those properties are becoming nuisance properties and address them through the municipal court or district court or wherever they have to go. But we're not going to occasionally license an event knowing that 42 more unlicensed events have already taken place. So I know you're subleasing from the property owner or leasing and then subleasing out to whoever wants to come have a party every Friday and Saturday night, but that's not going to happen unless I put the paperwork in or it doesn't. You can put the paperwork in for sure. No, doesn't mean we're going to grant it. But I think what we're all trying to tell you is you got to change your ways and you certainly can't come in there and tell us, oh, I don't have the control over that. You've allowed unlicensed events in your subleased property dozens of times and then now you come here and say, I'm going to actually ask because the clerk's office reached out to you and said you can't do that anymore. Now you're going to ask and the expectation is that we're going to grant it. I'm not so sure that's going to happen. But councilor, one question. We said that we scheduled three police officers. Was that for one of his events? And that police officer didn't get. No, it was a different one. Okay. In all the conversation, Chief penis, did the fire marshal get paid? That's what that was. Another question. Yes. The fire detail got paid. Yes, that's what. We're just asking the question. But the three police officers that they said they would gladly pay for, they stiffed them. Not suggesting that you, Mister Montero, but it's the same properties with unlicensed events going on and on and on and on and on. You know, I don't know what we can do, but we will do. We will go down a path of trying to find out what we can do. And if it ultimately leads to those properties, that's not your problem. But the properties are being, ultimately being deemed a public nuisance. Then there's a different problem for the property owner. Although due respect, council president, it does end up becoming my problem, because at the end of the month, I still have to pay that. You leased it, presumably to run an art gallery, correct? Ariel and my brother ran the art down and we bailed him out and he owed us a significant amount of money. And either we gave everything to Leslie or we took away space. Well, that's between you and your landlord in order to make a profit or, you know, satisfy your monthly nut with your, your landlord. We're not going to put up with illegal events. Selling alcohol without licenses and not without entertainment licenses. It's just not going to happen. Yes. Okay. Council. Do you have anything else? Mister Montero? I know that your other business, you run a great. I've been there. However, we all were confused with this part, and unfortunately I can approve this license because the place is not ready and it's not going to be possible to.

You leased it, presumably to run an art gallery, correct? Ariel and my brother ran the art down and we bailed him out and he owed us a significant amount of money. And either we gave everything to Leslie or we took away space. Well, that's between you and your landlord in order to make a profit or, you know, satisfy your monthly nut with your, your landlord. We're not going to put up with illegal events. Selling alcohol without licenses and not without entertainment licenses. It's just not going to happen. Yes. Okay. Council. Do you have anything else? Mister Montero? I know that your other business, you run a great. I've been there. However, we all were confused with this part, and unfortunately I can approve this license because the place is not ready and it's not going to be possible to. So I'll take that as a motion in a moment, ma'am, I know you stood up, but this is a petition by an individual, Mister Montero, not a public hearing. We're here to hear from him about these three petitions. Is there anything else you'd like to tell us about those three events? The one that is supposed to happen this week? It's two events, three licenses. Friday is two different licenses. Entertainment and liquor. Saturday is just liquor. Jwan, he's very good guy. We all. I work in a prison. I help Smiley get the police chief in Providence. I know it's not directly, but we're trying to do good things. He does a fundraiser every year. Who is j one? He is in charge of Turnip Rhode island. He also, he's a very. We're all community leaders and we raise money. I have the Billy Taylor house on campus. I pay kids every summer. I work in a prison. I run all the education in the prison. So we're trying to do. And I kind of feel bad because I'm like, what am I going to tell this stuff? Well, how about the 30 year old? Do you even know? Mister President, I'm sorry to. I have a, I have a question for you. For me? Can, can we accept the fundraiser and not the 30? Yes, if it has all the. Everything that it needs for the fundraiser, which is non alcoholic. Right? Um, the fundraiser. No, the fund. The fund. The Friday is entertainment and alcohol. Saturday is just alcohol. But if, if ultimately you want to make a motion to separate the, the two nights, I don't have a problem with that. Okay. In that case, I think it's. Councilor. Yeah. Just one final thing. All these events have taken place. They involve music, entertainment as well. Most of the events we do are not going to be like public events. Most because I have mostly oracles, birthday parties, baby showers. They're advertised. They're advertised on a website, correct. All those. All those are ozone. I can't claim all that. And, but I'm not advertising. But they're at 249. So if I came to you and said, I'd like to hold an event at your property, at your subleased space. Yeah. On a Friday. And you'll say to me $500 thousand dollars less, but yes. Okay, $200. That's what I. And then what you're saying is then it's up to me. They get the license and whether I advertise and, you know, I don't have time. I got a full time job and a pizza. I don't have time. Okay, but that's not what I was getting too. A lot of these events have already taken place. Did it involve like music entertainment as well? Um, some. Some have been like hip hop showcases. But a majority of events we do will be a birthday party, baby shower. Because it's mostly between people, a lot of people. Which is why I'm still baffled as to how all of these events could be going on for almost a year and nobody took notice. Well, it's not open. Doesn't matter. But what it's advertised. My point is the police is patrolling the area. It's downtown, protected, and nobody hears loud music and events going on. Nobody took notice, any of that. It's just really unbaffled. By that, truly, I'm baffled, too, but I'm, I'm not baffled that the police didn't notice it. They've got plenty of things to do. I certainly wouldn't take them to task for not knowing. No, same thing with the, with the clerk's law. But when they drop in their lap and they say, geez, but this is what's going on. And then we realize, I was going on this weekend. It's been going on for the last twelve weeks, you know, and I said, I'm not trying to place direct blame on the police. I mean, places patrolling the area. You hear a lot of music. There's events going on. At some point, this should have come up sooner than it has. I mean, I'm just. All right, we're going to cut this. Can I just. Yes, please. All right. You know, I'm looking at, you know, the turnip Rhode island. I've looked them up. Seems like a real good organization. Really helps the kids. Right. Who wants. We all want to advocate for that. And of course, the 30th birthday party. But the overwhelming fact I'm having a problem with is the fire department feels it's not deemed right now as an assembled area. So I don't want to sit here and knowingly maybe have a safety concern because it's not permitted for that usage, whether they've been used before or not. Now we know. So I don't know how I could move forward in approving something in an area that hasn't been deemed safe. I don't know how long I will take the fire department to do, you know, could we do it in time for. They deem it okay and then by the, by Friday or not. I don't know. I don't know how long that takes. But to knowingly have them appear before us, ask the questions and say it's not deemed for that type of event. I don't know how I could knowingly say, okay, even though these seem like great, you know, great event with, with the turn up Rhode island and of course, somebody's 30th birthday party is important to them, but we need to have it in a safe area.

Only thing I'm just waiting on, and I think they can. Everything's done. We can find out your bob just has to come or, and just so not to tell Mister Montero how to run, what kind of business to run. In my opinion, the easiest thing for him to do would be to apply for an assembly permit. We could go and inspect him as an assembly and then he'd be cleared. We'd give him a capacity for that building and then that would be okay for him to run the events. As far as we're concerned, safety wise, it still falls on the clerk and everybody else to meet those requirements. But as far as our requirements, if he. If he calls us tomorrow, we could probably set him up to get an inspection tomorrow. I don't know what deficiencies he may have for the new inspection, but that's the best we can offer to have him. And I'm with councilors, I'm not comfortable approving a license on Wednesday night for a Friday night and a Saturday night event that may or may not pass muster with you guys. Correct. Especially on the anniversary of the station of nightclubs fire. And it's just so. I think we've beaten this to death. I'll entertain a motion. Councilor code, do you have a motion? First, do you want to take them separately, Friday and Saturday? Do you want to make a motion on. Well, no. The fire department already said that it's not ready and the safety is important. I will suggest Mister Montero to meet with a legal advisor and see what everything you need so you can be more clear. I see that you're still confused. Unfortunately, I can approve this. I move to deny the license. All three? All three been moved by consular code. Second, by both Consular Arugo and Consul Moreno. That the application for the three. The petition for the three licenses a, B and c be denied. Is there any discussion on the motion? We're going to call a roll on this. President Mercer. No. Yes. For the denial. Councilor Rugio. Yes. Council coder. Yes. Councillor Gregor. Yes. Councilor Moreno. Yes. Councilor Rubio. Council Koviak. Councilor Wilderness. Yes. Eight to zero to deny.

That we adjourn as a protected board of license commissions and convenience. City council, before we do, I'd ask that everyone in attendance please rise and join us in the pledge of allegiance. Second City council, come to order. Clerk will call a roll. President Mercer? Here. Councillor Rugio. Here. Councillor Coder. Here. Councillor Greger. Here. Councillor Moran. Council Moreno? Here. Councilor Rubio? Kobiak. Council Weldon here, eight in attendance. Mister President, item number one, I call for approval of the previous minutes of January 31, 2024 of the Joint City Property Committee and Committee of the Whole City Council, the February 7, 2024 meetings of the Finance Committee, Joint Finance Committee, Public Works Committee, Committee on Claims, impending Suits, and the city council, as well as the minutes of February 14, 2024 of the ad hoc Municipal Judge Application Committee.

Chief Municipal Court Judge John T. Gannon, Esquire, make a motion to approve on a roll call vote move by Councilor Rudra, second by councilor Moreno and councilor Codea, that approval be given to the ad hoc committee's recommendation of John T. Gannon, esquire to be appointed the chief municipal judge court judge to a three year term. The motion is for a roll call vote. Any discussion on this matter, councilor? Yes. Well, first of all, thank you, Mister President. I want to thank all the folks who submitted resumes and letters of intent for the two positions that are up for appointments today. I'd also like to thank the ad hoc committee members that served with me as we went through the candidates. And yes, I do recommend John T. Gannon. He has 37 years practice in law. He's been with the municipal court for ten years. Judge Nestor Bush actually came and spoke on his behalf. I've heard that the courts ran pretty good here in Pawtucket. One gentleman even said it's the best out of the three municipalities he's worked in. And I look for that continuity if we have something, a good department running and you know, you're lead, your chief leads. That continuity with somebody that's been doing a good job in that role, I think is very important to keep, to keep the court running as well as it has been. So, you know, I appreciate, you know, Judge Gannon looking, you know, presenting and wanting to be the chief and presenting his background and yeah, I think he would be a good fit. It would be a good transition knowing he's been there that long and the courts are running well. And that continuity I think is very, very important. That's Rubio. Respectfully to the ad hoc committee, I first off, I want to say thank you to all the candidates who applied to this position, these positions, and that I had the pleasure of speaking with during my process of making the best decision. I want to say thank you for your service and your commitment to the topic. With that said, I feel our city needs appointments who are representative of our community, who have the experience, knowledge, the skillset, who is relatable and who may speak multiple languages. And in our community that have such diverse backgrounds, I think it's an important element. It's something that can't be just kind of pushed to the side. That's how I will be voting. But truly, I don't feel comfortable voting today with everything that's transpired over the course of the week. And I ask my council members to possibly postpone these appointments for today. Is that a motion? That's a motion. Then a motion to postpone this vote. Is there a second? 2nd okay. And any discussion on the motion to postpone council? Gregor, you were first. Yeah. I also share the concerns and thank you for all the folks who have submitted their application. I mean, Judge Gagner has been doing this for a while. He's recommended by the outgoing judge that in itself is, I think, worth something. However, the chairman came up, made some pretty good points, and it kind of makes sense that perhaps it should be postponed for some further discussion with regards to what's the best way forward going on this. So I actually did my own due diligence, and I understand that this position didn't require interviews, but I was actually just a little shocked that not even one or two questions was asked. So I wanted to do my own due diligence. So I did actually talk to each one of the candidates. And though I think that they are well qualified and can serve, I'm also put at a pause to make a vote today with things that have come out today and some things that have come across our desk. You know, I always tell every time we have a vote, I say to our public, I'm thoughtful and I'm reflective. And if I did not follow that same standard and moral standing that I have with all votes, then I would be doing a disservice to me and to my constituents. You know, I do. This is just personal opinion. I do think, I do wish both candidates had the skill of another language. That's just my personal opinion, and that's a skill anybody can have regardless of their background, you know? And I also want to state that I wish more people would apply not only for this, but for elected positions. For appointed positions, um, that are, you know, I. I want to encourage people from all different backgrounds who are qualified, um, to apply for positions like that. Again, I do think both are qualified, um, things. There's certain things that have just given me a pause. One thing I paused at was to see that the Rhode island bar, a month ago said who the chief was. That gave me pause. Um, so I'm not saying I would not vote for them on a later date, but today I would just like to take a pause. So that's why I am seconding consular Rubio.

Yeah, I was going to relay my comments, but I'll turn around, make my comments, turn in the reason why I won't vote for a pause. Ten years ago, and I've been here long enough, that we voted for an associate judge. And Jack Gannon, I think that he's done a job, that we haven't received one judicial complaint in those ten years, and he deserves to be elevated at this point. And for that reason, I'll be voting no, to deny waiting to put him where he belongs. Brennan, before I get to you for a second time, is there anybody else, counselor, I just wanted to add one other thing. I'm not at all swayed by the report on the news regarding comments I made regarding his challenge of the administration or the council, because I think that's what we need. Anytime you have unchecked power and the fact that Mister Gagnet is willing to make criticism, but both the council and the administration is something that actually. Well, yes, counselor, can I just add that I agree with Councilor Gregor. I don't care about who doesn't like each other, who doesn't whatever. To me, that's all non productive stuff, so none of that matters to me either. What is it then, that you mentioned all the things that have come out in the past week? I don't even really know what you're talking about. I just have pause from that hearing about the bar thing. I have pause about costing taxpayers some money. And I have paused about an email chain that's been going back around to our desk. And I am just pausing because I don't know if that's becoming a bigger issue or not, and that this is all just my opinion. Okay, I will say this. I will be voting no. Absolutely no. As for the Ryland Bar association, nobody contacted me, nobody contacted the clerk's office. As far as though they published something, maybe it's been wrong for years, I don't know. But there's been no discussion with anybody about a publication of somebody being elevated, so I don't know where that came from. I'm just. I'm just saying that any more discussion on this motion, that case, the clerk will call a roll. President mercy. No, Doctor Rugo? No. Doctor Coder? No doctor Gregor. This is just to postpone. To postpone? Yes. Yes. Yes, I hope to postpone. Council Moreno. Councillor Rubio. Yes. Council Skoviak. Council wilderness. Three to five against. Postponing. Okay, so that fails. We are on. We are back on item three, counselor. No, I mean item you. May. You. I already made the motion. You made a motion about the body of work that most. That motion is not. That motion has already been seconded. It's on the floor. Any discussion about the appointment of John T. Gannon to Chief judge? Did you already say your piece, Councilor Moreno? Yeah. So I just wanted to applaud the efforts of the former chief who explained who was at the. Hey. Her emphasis on the need for continuity in the court. And I think that an associate judge. And then it's the individual who should fill her boots this side. All right. I prepared some remarks and I was hoping I wasn't going to have to give them or at least all of them. But, you know, I'm astounded that we are talking about this, because nothing is new, nothing in. I'll talk about the elephant in the room. This story. There is nothing in this story that is not close to ten years old costing taxpayers money. Not close to ten years old. The council knew was my third meeting as a council member in February of 2013. And we appointed, we elevated Judge Nestle Bush to the chief judge, and we appointed the counsel, appointed John Gannon as the associate to fill out the final two years of Judge Nestle Busch's term. It was my third meeting. As I said, I didn't know Jack Gannon had heard his name. I also knew there were some issues that were swirling and starting brewing between him and the mayor, but nothing more. So the council at that time, again, my third meeting, some well seasoned council members thought that he would be a good fit for the associate judge position. And they knew of all of the ancillary positions in 2000 issues. In 2013, they knew the personal animosity. And today, a nearly ten year old lawsuit is being revisited. We knew all of that when he was reappointed in 2015, this council did. Maybe not all these members, but this council understood that in 2015. We understood it in 2018. We understand it in 2021. In no time in that ten or eleven years has he done anything except represent the city in an exquisite fashion as an associate judge on the municipal bench. I don't think any of the eight of us here can suggest otherwise. You know, the process has been, has been quibbled with. We asked anybody who was interested put their best foot forward and send us a resume and a letter of interest. We got four, three very well qualified, and one not so well qualified. I decided I'm the one who put the process together, and I asked the committee to look solely at the black and white objective information we had. There was no need for an interview, no requirement for an interview.

There was no need for an interview, no requirement for an interview. And again, as Mister Jaramello said, I said it was simply an appointment, and I stand by that. Interviews could have swayed things. Personalities could sway things. That's just like a judge looks at things objectively, black and white. That's what we asked our committee to do. It's also what we've asked Judge Gannon to do for eleven years now. He has tuned out all of the secondary ancillary issues and judged everything fairly and objectively for ten or eleven years now. And this whole thing is exactly what we're expecting out of democratic justice. You know, the mayor made a very tough decision ten years ago, twelve years ago, whatever it was, to let go a firefighter during his probationary period, that was a tough decision on his end, I'm sure, because it wound up costing him a longtime friend and causing animosity. At the very least, the firefighter felt aggrieved by the fire. What happens in the justice department or the justice in this country? He filed a lawsuit. He asked his father's firm to represent him. Should he have gone someplace else? That's, that's the long and short of it. Ultimately, the courts did their job. They vetted the whole thing. They saw it the city's way and it was done. It was done years ago. But now, because we have a newspaper article and in my opinion, looking over everything, looking at the resumes, looking at letters, a woefully less qualified individual who is suggesting that the members of the ad hoc committee, simply because their Hispanic should have voted for her. Matter of fact, I don't want to go all the way into this, but I think the quote was she was disgusted. Disgusted that the, I want to find disgusted. The two Latinos on the committee didn't even consider their own view. Does that sound like something you want a judge to say? Does that sound like something you want a judge to say? It boggled my mind. And I, on behalf of the city, would like to apologize to councilor coder and councilor Moreno for that wrong headedness, number one. And if I had any part in that by putting them on the committee, I apologize for that too. But you did your job. You did exactly what you were supposed to do. You know, she also, again, I think this was a needless story, but to be perfectly honest with you, it did some good because it spotlighted the correct decision this ad hoc committee made relative to the candidates. I only feel badly that we don't have three spots to include Kevin Crowley, who is again, far more qualified and has far more relevant qualifications than bilingualism. I reached out. I've had probably five conversations in my entire lifetime with Jack Gannon. I've had more conversations with Maribella Treveri. I've had more conversations with Patrick McBurney. I've had more conversations with Kevin Crowley. I've had meals with each of those three. I've never sat down for a meal or a drink with Jack Gannon. But I do respect the job he's done on the bench. And nothing in this ten year old story is going to change that. What it did do is spotlight again the proper, in my estimation, vetting and ranking. And I just can't get past. You know, Miss Echeveria just passed the Rhode island bar seven months ago. Seven months. All of her. All of her experience is essentially in. In house legal work for companies. I don't know that she's ever set foot in a courtroom. I do know her resume suggests for from 2013 to 2016, she was a junior associate with. With Judge Nestle Bush's practice. I don't know the legalities of being a junior associate in a Rhode island law firm if you haven't passed Rhode island bar. But it certainly suggests that she represented clients during that period, so maybe that's when she was in the court. I guess if I had no relevant legal experience and I felt like I should be a judge, I would probably approach it the same way. Past stones that the sitting judge in the background, anyway, suggest that two members of the committee should have looked at it one particular way because they share an ethnicity. I just find that to be so injudicious. I can't explain it. I really can't explain it. And it was like a light bulb moment for me, that I was looking at it solely from a lack of relevant experience. And what I wound up confirming was a lack of judicial comportment. The final. You know, I'll finish my comment with the same way this valley breeze story ended, with Miss Echevere saying, I'll paraphrase, we have two caucasian men, and that's a step backwards. Would you want to be a caucasian man to stand in front of a judge who basically said, I see ethnicity first? How in good conscience could we have put her on the bench? And I, for one, thank the committee for doing what they did, vetting it, each of the candidates. And I would urge the rest of you to go back and look at the resume, look at the letters, and see what relevant experiences. I don't think you'll have any problem voting to elevate Judge Gannon to the chief judge. But I will be voting yes, for sure. Clerk will call a roll. President Mercer. Yes. Councilor Rugo? Yes.

The ad hoc municipal judge application committee submits the recommendation that Patrick McBrenny, Esquire, be appointed associate municipal court judge, three year term, associate Municipal Court judge Patrick McBurney, Esquire. I motion to approve, on a roll call vote removed by councilor, second by council Moreno and councillor Wildenhain, that approval be given to the subcommittees. The committee's recommendation that Patrick McBurney, Esquire, be appointed to the three year term as municipal. The associate municipal court judge. The motion is for approval on a roll call vote. Is there any discussion, counselor? Yes, I just for clarification purposes, and I guess in defense of Maribel, it should be application. She doesn't apply for the cheek, just so she applies for the associate. I don't think I said that. I'm just suggested because we're all talking about chief position. Okay. Do you have anything on this motion? Okay, thank you. Anyone on this side, counselor? Okay, I would just like to again, thank the other three candidates, and I'd like to thank the ad hoc committee for doing their due diligence and looking at the candidates. You know, we saw the body of work that they all three presented, and they all have their level of expertise, level of experience. And there were two that really jumped out that had municipal court experience and zoning experience. And, you know, Mister McBurney is actually a partner in a law firm since 2015. And you know that, you know, and plus knowing the zoning and land usage and that comes in handy, that's transferable, in my opinion, to any kind of code issues that come up in the courts. And it was a tough call, but basically, you know, I think, you know, nominating, you know, attorney McBurney for this position, I think was the right call based on the body of work that I saw of all three candidates. And that's what we had to go by. We. I looked it over. We had a couple, you know, good two weeks of soda, really digest it. And I think he will be, based on what I can see, a fine addition to the court. Anyone else? I would like to say that Mister McBraney being for years in this field, and like I said before, all his family too. I know that this only said that I said that I know the family, but I also know what kind of professional he is. And all the years that you've been serving as a lawyer and to actually end the love that you have for the city of Pataky. Thank you, Councilor Moreno. Thank you, Bruce. Thank you. Thank you, president. I also just have to echo chairman of counselor. I am think that attorney Ernie's qualifications they can speak for selves. And I would be knowledge that the application of heaven Raleigh was a. Was an extremely qualified attorney and who I think will continue to serve our Eddie in the. In the future. Anyone else aside. So I'll just. Yes. No, yeah, I just want to add in terms of Patrick McCartney's application and he's qualified to agree with all of that. And I know people said families and such, but his family does have a commitment to protect it for a long time. So that those needs something today. Thank you. I think it does to all of us. I concur with everything. I think, again, I said it previously about all four candidates. I think when it comes to Patrick McBurney and Kevin Crowley, I've known both of them a long time. I've known Kevin for 50 years, probably. They both have quite a bit of relevant experience. And again, that's the difference. Relevant experience. Patrick has quite a bit of experience with land use issues. And to be perfectly honest, from a judicial standpoint, he's got a brother and a father who sit on the state's superior court benchmark. It's a commitment to the city and it's been a family's commitment to legal profession and justice here in the city and in the state. I think he will be an exceptional associate justice.

The city property committee submits the following resolution. A resolution authorizing the city of Pawtucket to enter into a one year lease extension agreement with Nexus Property Management, LLC for the use of the parking lot on Summer street and 49 North Union Street, AP 43, lot 629. And a one year lease agreement with collaboratives, LLC for the use of the parking lot at 217 Main Street. AP 43 lot 594 for the tucket public library. I move for approval on a roll call vote. Second summer street collaborative 17. So this is a lease, at least with Nexus that we do every year. So it's exactly the same lease for Nexus and anticipation of losing spots eventually maybe, and also just needing more spots now because nexus is developing that property. The Patucket public library has gone out to try to find more parking, and they have come to this agreement with core collaboratives LLC for about six spots at 217 Main street. The lease is very similar to the same with Nexus. Obviously. The only difference is who's leasing it and the amount is much less us. Can you tell me, excuse me, councilor, can you tell me where the reference of the 217 Main street might be? So it's the back is core collapse. So if you're standing in front of, let's say, that main entrance of Pawtucket Public library. Yeah. And it was a bank across the street. Yes. No, it's down below. Down the below. It's down below. Behind the Black lives matter. Yeah, it's the back of regular main street. Normally we do law every year, but the other. Yeah, it dips down like. So if you're looking at the bank, you just go down that way. It was an additional. May I? It was an additional area because they, they're not sure, you know, nexus is talking about doing something with the property, so it's miss. We thought it was advantageous to get another area. So.

It's news to me. I don't know that it's required, but if there's an ordinance that requires it, we'll ask them for. So that's why I like to send a letter regarding that. If the one. If there is an annual report. Done. And if it is, I'd like to get that report regarding the open space and the parts. In that case, let's just amend the agenda for the purpose of making that motion. Okay? So the move by councilor Gregor, seconded by councillor Moreno, and we amended the agenda tonight to allow for the proposal to send a letter to the parks commission. All in favor amending the agenda? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries. Now, the motion is to send a letter to the parks commission asking for the report that is required. And, Rick, I would assume you'd be able to pick up the ordinance citation? Yes. That would work for you. Yeah.

In that case, let's just amend the agenda for the purpose of making that motion. Okay? So the move by councilor Gregor, seconded by councillor Moreno, and we amended the agenda tonight to allow for the proposal to send a letter to the parks commission. All in favor amending the agenda? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries. Now, the motion is to send a letter to the parks commission asking for the report that is required. And, Rick, I would assume you'd be able to pick up the ordinance citation? Yes. That would work for you. Yeah. The annual report, minuscule, is supposed to be submitted to the council by the end of December. So that is, in fact, the case since regard open space and the parks status plans for the city. So if there is such a report that's supposed to be submitted, I would like it to be forward it to us. Okay. So the motion is to ask them if they have the report, and would they please forward it to us if they have not already done so. Correct? Correct. That motion was by councilor councillor Gregor and second by councilor Moreno. All in favor of sending that communication? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries. The second issue I want to make up is regarding Elizabeth Boulevard School. I was at the school committee meeting last week, and I think it was colier, whoever the project manager is, for that building project, and they apparently had brought up several what they call engineering value changes to the school, which I consider to be pretty significant, because I think I don't want this to come off as like, it's a bait and switch. We promised that the school was going to be state of yard and all of these other things were going to happen. And now some of these changes would seem to. We're going to be getting a nefarious product for what was promised to the children that were going to be attending bolo school. Also the citizens paying for these items. So I would just like to get the report that was submitted to the school of park department, the school committee, so we can see for ourselves what these actual changes are, which they're calling engineering value changes. So your motion would be. Again, we have to manage that, but your motion would be to send a communication to the school committee asking for that report. School committee and a project manager, which I believe is called. Yeah, well, I don't know that we have. Well, let's. For a moment, let's. All in favor of amending the agenda for the purpose of discussing sending a communication. I oppose motion carriers. Okay. So the. I don't know that we have the authority to be contacting colliers or anybody that's, you know, you hear the term stay in your lane. That's. We're told that frequently from the administration. Stay in your lane. I would be comfortable sending a letter of communication to the school committee asking for clarification on those or the report itself, but I don't. I would not be comfortable sending a communication to a vendor of a school committee when they have full control over school buildings. That's fair. I would like to reply. Okay. That adequately identified for you, Rick? Did you just. So a communication moved by councillor, Councillor Greger, second by councilor wilderness, that a communication be sent to the school committee asking them for the report on changes, engineering value changes pertaining to Baldwin, which they presented last Tuesday. I think it was. I would assume it's probably a public document anyway, but the request is that they send the council that. That document that adequately articulated. Yeah, well, I just wanted to be specific that the value changes that was actually implemented and changes, I would like to know exactly. Yeah, well, the report that they outline, what those values are actually, how much is being changed? What are these changes account for? So I don't want the kids in my district to be short change and get an inferior product on what was promised. So I'll vote for it. I get the sense we're delving someplace we're not supposed to be, but if it's a public document, because my concern is we asked for this. They send it to us, it gets put on the next agenda. And now we're pontificating from this chamber on something we have no control over. They are elected to do just that. I don't want to muddy the waters, but I will vote for the. I will vote for the correspondence. Anybody else wanted to weigh in? Council? Yeah, no, I definitely would like, you know, it's good to know. Would like to know what those changes are. But as President Mercer said, in the governance structure, they definitely have. Can control of everything. So we can ask and see if they can share that with us. Right. And. But I would very much be leery of, like president said, speaking and pontificating on an issue that through title six, chapter, title 16 of the general laws, they have care and control of. And so as we have these olive branches of working together collaboratively with other branches of government in the city, I think the ask is a good ask, but I'd be careful about, you know, debating it. They're probably trying to do some kind of structure or whatever within the budget, but it would be good to know because, you know, a lot of people come to us with questions on schools, so. And we want to know what's happening in your district as an out lodge. I want to know what's going on, too, as well. So it's a good question. But, you know, just gotta be careful knowing that that's.

I just need a moment. That's so we do. Oh, yes. Ah, yes. Next to water before we shot start free counsel. Is there anybody online? Yes, that's right. Up in time for public input? I have two. Yes, Rick. Yes. Okay. Good evening, everyone. Welcome to the Jenks JMW Media center. We moved tonight's meeting here because of the threat of rain on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week. And sometimes that causes the elevator at city hall, among other places, to flood. And without an elevator, we're not handicapped accessible. So we moved it out of an abundance portion here to a venue that we know is always going to be handicapped accessible. So with that, the first thing on our agenda tonight is a pre council appointment of Nancy Whitney for the juvenile hearing. Nancy, are you here? Do you want to just come forward for a moment? No heavy lifting here. Just come to the podium. Want to just give us a little bit of background on why you were interested in being on the juvenile hearing board, and we'll certainly thank you for your time and your efforts to come. So I'm interested in serving on the juvenile hearing board because I'd like to see the kids in Pawtucket get a fair opportunity. I would hope that whatever outcome they receive from the juvenile hearing board, they would learn and not get caught up in the judicial system or end up in juvenile family court or a detention facility or whatever. I feel that once they go down that road becomes a patent for them and they end up doing the same thing as adults. And I just think the juvenile hearing board is a great stop for them. And like I said, I hope they learn from their mistakes. I see it happen all the time because I do work for Cumberland police and I am their records clerk and I see a lot of repeat offenders and I don't want to see the kids go down that road. And that's basically it. Well, that's why we have the juvenile hearing board for just that reason. So we appreciate your willingness to serve. Does anybody have any questions for Nancy or. Yeah, again, we all thank everybody who joins a board or a commission. We thank them for their time because it's kind of a thankless job sometimes, and this can be what you make of it. Sometimes it's more involved and sometimes it's less. But we certainly thank you for your willingness to help. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. That brings us to public input. We have 12345 folks in the building and two people online who signed up by 635. So the first one signed up is Mister Michael Pompili. Mister Pompili and I'll just. I'll just mention we've got a number of people signed up. It's going to be a total of seven. Anyway, we set aside 30 minutes. We're starting late, so brevity would be appreciated. Thank you. Pretty brief tonight. Promise. I'd like to address two items tonight. The first is related to item M on the consent agenda, the value engineering report for the new Baldwin elementary school to remain on budget. As shown in the report, nearly $2 million in improvements have been shelved or reduced, including the quality and aesthetics of materials inside and outside the building, reducing the number of dry erase boards for teachers by 25%, reducing the number of basketball hoops from six to two, and the replacement of a full kitchen with only a warming kitchen. This should be taken as a preview of the compromise, as we may see, to keep the unified high school in its $330 million budget. The city of Warwick, facing similar challenges with its new $350 million high school, proposed to replace Tolgie and Pilgrim, cut air conditioning and cut common spaces, which was a major selling point for the Pawtucket school committee's architect at the unified high school and why it was necessary. The bolding community is not getting delivery of the project they were promised. As we enter stage three for the unified high school and hopefully start looking at real world construction costs as opposed to preliminary design at stage two, I again urge the council to exercise oversight over the school committee and its consultants and facilitate meaningful public dialogue as we progress with the most expensive and impactful public building project in the city's history. I'd also like to address the city's land and water conservation fund conversion application, which was submitted to Dem in January. Proposing to construct a new Riverside park on Pleasant street, leveling the undeveloped portion of Riverside Cemetery to add more playing Field to Noak Hill, adjacent to Max Reed Field to atone for selling Woodlawn's Morley Field for development, as well as for past development of the McCoy annex and a portion of Dunnell park in East Riverview, both environmental justice communities.

Thank you, Mister west. Thank you very much, Mister chairman, mister president, and members of the council. I want to say a word of thanks to all of you. My name is Phil west. I'm a resident of Unity street and Ward five. I want to speak briefly to two items on the consent agenda for tonight. First, the Hopkins the request for a approval of the Hopkinton Town Council's request to you to oppose 7062 in the legislation before the General assembly that would allow ADU units. And secondly, I want to speak to the question of the condition of the property by Morley Field. So, first, the Hopkinton resolution. I've worked on affordable housing throughout my adult life since the 1970s in New York City, and I serve as a volunteer lobbyist for the Village common of Rhode island, which is an organization that helps older adults stay safely in homes that they love. I'm not speaking on their behalf tonight, but the village common strongly supports the ADU legislation, accessory dwelling unit legislation, which has been presented several years in a row and has been refined and improved as we've come forward. Accessory dwelling units are a really crucial part of the answer to Rhode Island's critical shortage of affordable housing. We simply have to do this. And so they allow people to expand. I won't get into details about it, but it allows people to create an accessory dwelling unit, whether above a garage or in a backyard or in connection with an existing structure. And this is valuable to older adults. It's valuable in many situations, and for the benefit of the council, it really helps that individuals are adding to the housing stock at no public expense. The tragedy is that we have opposition from a number of cities and towns, often not public, as Hopkins is, but opposition from those who like their large lot zoning and their rural venue, and who tend to ignore the needs of people in the cities. And in a word, what tends to happen is that they're saying, we want people to come and help us, whether it's cnas in our healthcare, in homes, and so on. Our teachers in our schools are firefighters, but they don't want to have to house those people or their families. So this legislation has real problems. I would go into its details with you, but there's not time tonight, but I hope that you will study it and take exactly the opposite side. I hope that you will support this legislation. All the members of the Pawtucket General assembly delegation are supporting and. And some are co sponsors. This is legislation that is much needed and will make a huge difference to the state of Rhode island if it only gets done. All the organizations support it. That care about affordable housing from the AARP all the way through to the village common in the United Way. The opposition is only from real estate interests that don't want to tamper with the large lot zoning, which is a problem. So having said that, I think there's an unmistakable message behind the opposition to this bill. And it is, yes, we want affordable housing, but not in our backyard. There is an unstated premise. We don't want those people coming here. There is an unspoken motive, which I've already alluded to in terms of wanting to have healthcare help and teachers and so on, but not wanting to deal with the children of those people who they need as workers. So I hope that you will take exactly the opposite position from what Hopkinton has asked you to do and that you will support this legislation. So that. And I'll answer any questions if you wish. Secondly, Morley Field, and I come to you not knowing what all of you may have done about Morley Field. I know that Councilman Gregor, who is my councilman, has done an enormous amount of work over a number of years. And you have on the agenda an email string from the mayor that started when I sent a protest to the director of the director of environmental management about the terrible conditions that morally field as they are now. And I sent pictures of easy ways for people, and I sent them to all of you as well, but easy ways for people to go through the fence or around the fence. And of the terrible conditions inside. The mounds of broken concrete, the piles of rusting and jagged iron and scrap metal, the piles of uncovered soil that may have who knows what kind of asbestos ready to blow away, piles of firewood that's just inviting someone to go in and torch it. And you can see that people have been in there a lot because there is fresh graffiti on the walls on the far end. It's a terrible situation, and now it's attracting worse as people are coming and dumping tires and garbage on the opposite side of Mahashuk street.

And you have on the agenda an email string from the mayor that started when I sent a protest to the director of the director of environmental management about the terrible conditions that morally field as they are now. And I sent pictures of easy ways for people, and I sent them to all of you as well, but easy ways for people to go through the fence or around the fence. And of the terrible conditions inside. The mounds of broken concrete, the piles of rusting and jagged iron and scrap metal, the piles of uncovered soil that may have who knows what kind of asbestos ready to blow away, piles of firewood that's just inviting someone to go in and torch it. And you can see that people have been in there a lot because there is fresh graffiti on the walls on the far end. It's a terrible situation, and now it's attracting worse as people are coming and dumping tires and garbage on the opposite side of Mahashuk street. I've sent pictures of that again and again. And what I'm asking tonight is that the city council take responsibility to provide oversight to make sure that this gets fixed. And I think part of that prior speaker referred to the question of the substitution of the riverside property for Morley Field, which a number of us had said is a terrible mistake. It won't work. It's too far away. It's simply not the right solution. The answer is to fix Morley Field and to create other recreational space in Woodlawn. This is a neighborhood which has been severely disadvantaged, cut in half by the highway and where people suffer the constant noise of traffic and the fumes from the trucks. And when I walked in a couple of days ago, the constant smell now of marijuana from the dispensary. So I've said enough, and I hope that the city council will go ahead and exert your authority and take these situations in hand. I'll be glad to answer any questions. Thank you, Mister west. Thank you. Next on our agenda signed up is Miss Lisa Bead in 33 Marbury street. Good evening, everybody. I had submitted some. I tried to submit a testimony and it failed because I'm using a new program. And along with that is a. So I have three things that I'd like to talk about very briefly. One of them is new, which is also the support for the AdUs that Mister west just talked about. We have, as you know, we have terrible homeless problems and problems with the rising rent and in Pawtucket and all over Rhode island. And it needs to be addressed. And this is the most economically viable and humane way of doing it, besides putting lots of federal dollars, lots of tax dollars into new housing. And it also gives income stream to people who have property and whose taxes are just, have become untenable and may lose their homes just because of taxes. So that's the first one. The second one is support for, as I spoke in the other meeting, of a request that you actively support the renaissance of downtown Tucket, because the people who are there putting their hearts and souls into Pawtucket, into downtown, which was dead, has been dead for the last 44 years that I've lived here, is a miracle. And I urge you to do everything possible to help them and us become more viable as a city. So that's second. And the third one is to talk about the issue of one moshasic combined effort of one Moshe and Morley Field. So the first thing I wanted to say that I had, I will ask Michelle whether she will copy this document, which I think that you need to see is the Department of Environmental Management, Environmental justice policy version 1.3, September 25, 2023, which says, serving our communities, protecting our environment, and connecting our people. And it defines what environmental justice is all about. You can read about it. I was going to highlight things, but nothing works with computers and me at the age of 79. So I will just quote the very first part of the protecting our environment portion. It says, all people who live and work in Rhode island, regardless of income, race, ethnicity, or national origin, have a right to live in a clean and healthy environment. Dem strongly believes that no community should be burdened with adverse environmental and public health consequences. As a result of Rhode Island's industrial history and heritage, many communities in the state are disproportionately impacted by environmental and public health risks. And this environmental justice policy statement and is, is defined problem with one Moshassek and Morley Field and what the city plan and the city's plans for those places and what has been happening with those pieces of property. I have submitted, I testified a number of months ago about microfibers in the environment and how dangerous they are. Well, and I gave you information on the dangers of microfibers. I did a lot of research because, as you know, the building that was taken down there was a microfiber factory. And so I did a lot of research and discovered that while the FDA was it, the environment, whatever it is, federal environment, FDA, EPA, I'm sorry. Thank you. Gave. Wrote up that, you know, that's their position. Apparently, the Clean Water act is not. They're not able to do anything about it on a federal level because they've been restricted, because the Clean Water act has not been able to be expanded to include that. However, it needs to be done on. So they said the way to do it is to do it on a local level, at a city level. So you actually can ban microfibers in the environment and demand that it be cleaned up, because they are being, as we speak, with the rains, they're being washed into the river. So that's one thing. The other thing is that one, Moshe, as you know, and as councilor Gregor had said and has been constantly documenting, and I went with a friend and was documenting the terrible things that are happening there.

All the environmental pollution that's happening as we speak, and when it's dry blows and when it's wet, it runs into the river and into the air for children to breathe. JK equities needs to be held accountable for that. It's been going on absolutely. Much too long. DEM is not following their own policy because they're not enforcing it. You've got this. So you've got JK equities, which is in violation morally, scientifically, ethically, and damaging the health and welfare of not only the local population, which is the most vulnerable in the city, but mine as well, and yours, because of the pollution that moves through the air and the water. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So. And then I was going to. So, yes, so the, but Morley Field, the holding up of Morley Fields, the fence around Moshasik, is permeable in unbelievable ways. It was never sturdy. And then you look at Morley Field and it's so firm that you can't go through it. This is a playing field. So you've got the same. And you've got. And it's being held in abeyance for JK equities. And I want you to think about that. Think about what's happening with an unresponsive company and the danger of what's happening. Please take care of one roshasic, take care of your communities and take the fence around Morley Field away and put some money into it and get it to the point where kids can play there. Thank you so much. Thank you misses beat. Thank you very much misses Lynn Farinelli. Welcome, Miss Faranelli. Nice to see you walking up on your own. Yeah. Could you imagine? Because if I was in my wheelchair, I wouldn't be able to get into the Pawtucket Police department today, right? So. Yeah, you realize that and you double checked. This is just a little bit of housekeeping that I'm doing right now. You double checked and you said that people with disabilities would still be able to get into the building. The city was something like an elevator not being functional is what I'm saying. On occasion, I guess, is what I'm saying. Right. So I was looking for plan B and I. And plan b never came. So you, this, this council decided to purchase property over on freight street because the health and well being is so important to the citizens of the city of Pawtucket, except if they're in a wheelchair. I sat for 4 hours. When you go in that door, I sat on a landing for 4 hours and couldn't go to a bathroom and couldn't get anywhere because the elevator was not working. Now it's not your problem that the elevator doesn't work, but when you do move city hall over to freight street, there has to be a plan B for Ada in order for people with a disability to get into the Pawtucket police department. I see things are changing. You know, now we have the handicapped cards, you know, for handicapped parking inside, you know, the claims committee, that room that you use for like claims committee or whatever. And that's really great. I've seen extra, actually. It looks like Mister Arugio sitting underneath it, but he's not and I know that. So anyway, when you're sitting in the, in the. Have you seen it above your head? I think that, that is wonderful. That actually, somebody in a wheelchair who has not been able to get into that room can now have a. A designated spot. But what I don't appreciate with Ada is the fact that. And I can't see her. Not that I. Michelle Hardy told me that if I was not able to get to the third floor because she also has a breathing problem, is what she told me, that I could watch the committee meetings from home. That is the most unacceptable thing to say to somebody that's in a wheelchair that cannot get to a third floor and when an elevator isn't operational. Now, I understand we are here tonight because somebody in a wheelchair wouldn't have been able to get to the third floor. But what about all day? What about tomorrow? What about every other day that it rains and nobody, you have to go through city hall in order to get to the Pawtucket police department. That's first on the. We gotta fix a couple of things. President Marsa, the only one that got back to me about the Rhode island cold cases, I thought it was wonderful that you went to the finance department to double check that account. I think that that's wonderful. But what you really should have done was go find that unit. That unit has been closed for three years, but still taking money. In fact, it took Lynn Farinelli to bring that to their attention, for them to now take their donation button and change it from that. You were given to the cold case unit and now you're just giving to the Pawtucket police department. Here is another thing. I know that, Judge Gannon. I know I watched it from home. I did have my hand up. I wanted to have comment, but nobody called on me. But I did watch it from home.

And I saw a couple of people with a little pause, a little pause on, you know, should we, shouldn't we? Did he cost the city money? Let me just give you a little rundown, because, you know, some people are new. Lieutenant Asher. Anybody remembered Lieutenant Asher? He lost his leg. He lost his leg. And I know that you didn't appoint Tina Gonzalez, but she was the public safety director at the time. They didn't have the equipment that they needed and he lost his leg. And then somebody didn't want him, you know, wrote out the incident report and Tina Gonzalez wanted them to change the report. And now we have two lawsuits. So in case you're wondering, we can start with our calculator. Lieutenant Asher lost his leg, and another member of the ducket fire department has a whistleblower lawsuit. I stood before this council, not in this. Not in this forum here, but I can point out the people that I brought to the attention that there was an officer in the city of Pawtucket that was beating minorities, and nobody cared. Nobody cared. And then he shot a kid. Okay, got your calculator. The two people that were beat. One was groped, one was beat, and now look at what we've got. We got another lawsuit. But let's make sure that we give that that officer some money and have him go. Christine Cole. Cole case. You know the Cole case. Right on. Christine Cole. Okay, where is Sue Cormia? Anybody know? Anybody know where Sue Cormier after she accused somebody that didn't murder Christine Cole? And now that person has a big lawsuit. Got you. Calculator. That's gonna be a big lawsuit. That's all. And so far, we're only under Tina Gonzalez. Okay, detective with PTSD still made to work. Yeah, that's on to Tina. So that's enough. That's another lawsuit. So, I mean, we can keep adding it up, but for tonight, I just want to congratulate Judge Gannon, because I have never, ever heard that he was anything but professional in his professional position. So, anyway, so now. Now let's get to July. In July, I went to Frank Milos's office because we had two letters from the state medical examiner's office that clearly state that the Pawtucket police department lied in my son's death. Okay, so you all knew it. You all. Everybody has known about it. So we went to Frank Milos's office, and I had asked the fire chief if I could have Joseph's rescue running. And he said, so somebody down there said it was an opera. So we went to Frank Milos, and Frank Milos said, oh, no, that's not an opera. That's not an opera. That's not for our office to see. Months later, Frank Milos's office got my son's postmortem. Do you know what that is? That gives every inch of somebody's body. Okay, so if Frank Milos wasn't supposed to see a rescue report, he damn well didn't. Shouldn't have been looking at a postmortem. So that's in July. Shortly after that, got your calculators. Frank Milos took me to court. Do you want to know why? Frank Milos took me to court? So that I would not put out public records that he gave his public record. So he made a mistake, and he gave out public records that he shouldn't have and didn't redact information. Who paid for that? Who paid? Got your calculator the citizens did. The citizens paid for that. So I have a restraining order that I cannot publicize public records that are public record. But that's okay. You know why? Because Frank Milos gives public records when he shouldn't. And then he was. He holds back other records. Now, anybody know where Lizette Gomes is? Because I was just notified by the attorney general's office that Lizette Gomes no longer represents the city of Pawtucket. But yet, if you go on the website, her name is still there. She's the assistant city solicitor. No, she's not. No, she's not. Did you know that? Anybody? Anyway, so that was in July. In July, Frank Milos was going to work on this. This paperwork. It was printed out and it was on the chief of the fire department's desk. Are you looking at. Are you looking at that stopwatch there? Yeah. Oh, good. Good, because I'm not going to stop until I'm done. Okay? Just so you know, for everyone else, we generally limit it to five minutes. It's already been close to nine, so. Close to nine. Last time I spoke, it was twelve. And I believe that Mister Addison spoke for 22. Right? And so we do. I'm just. I know you're not interested, but I'm interested because if I sent this, according to Michelle Hardy, had I sent this as an email, as public input, it would never be seen anywhere, because there is no public comment section on the website where you can actually see what the public thinks if they can't get down here. But I'm getting there. Okay? So in July, Frank Milos was going to look to see if we could get this report. It was printed. I contacted recently, five, six weeks now. I contacted the chief of the fire department, and it was a long time to get in touch with him.

It's already been close to nine, so. Close to nine. Last time I spoke, it was twelve. And I believe that Mister Addison spoke for 22. Right? And so we do. I'm just. I know you're not interested, but I'm interested because if I sent this, according to Michelle Hardy, had I sent this as an email, as public input, it would never be seen anywhere, because there is no public comment section on the website where you can actually see what the public thinks if they can't get down here. But I'm getting there. Okay? So in July, Frank Milos was going to look to see if we could get this report. It was printed. I contacted recently, five, six weeks now. I contacted the chief of the fire department, and it was a long time to get in touch with him. The reason that I got in touch with him was because I was calling all his coworkers, saying, hey, if you see him, let him know Lynn Farinelli is looking to speak with him. He called me back on February 16. And on February 16, at 05:07, that man told me that Frank Milos, who told us that he should not have that. That paperwork. He gave that paperwork to Frank Milos's office. So after a little bit of confusion and being very upset, that why would Frank Milos have my kids? Shit. Right? Why would he. Why would he. So I called Frank Milos. At 934. I called Frank. I called Frank. He was like a pit bull that night. He was worse than I can be. He was mad. And he said, I think that he misspoke at 937, Frank called the fire chief to tell him she's upset. You better talk to her. At 945, the chief of the fire department called me. He called me and he said, I misspoke. I had somebody shred that paperwork. It never went to Frank Milos's office. It didn't go to Frank Milos's office. I had somebody shred it. So that's. That was story number two. My husband, on Monday, this week ago, a week ago, called the fire chief, and he asked, you know, he asked to speak with the fire chief. Now, in case you didn't know, Lizette's name still on the. On the website, um, I believe it says, uh, fire Chief Murray or Murphy or something. It doesn't even say Trenton, so. But we get. He gets the voicemail and he leaves the message. And then the fire chief called Frank Milos to find out what he should say to Mister Farinelli the very next day. The story now is that the fire chief swears on his children. Swears on his children. He did it himself. He shredded that paperwork. So don't worry, it's not out there. Nobody. Nobody has it because he shredded it. He's a liar. He's a liar. And why is Frank Milos directing this train that is getting derailed? I've been standing here for ten. Almost ten years. I've been wanting my son's file corrected with. With accurate information. It doesn't happen. My husband has been waiting for how long? Maybe three weeks for the chief, the police chief, to call him back, to sit down, to fix my son's file. Nothing happens here and nothing happens over there. And I feel bad for Mister Gregor because I really think that he truly has his whole heart and soul into his district. And people voted yes for a dog park because they care more about the dogs than they do about the children of that area. And now, because my husband, he starts work around, you know, he gets up around five. We're going to dinner. Goodbye. Thank you, Miss Farinelli. Last person in the building to sign up is John Jarmillo. Mister Caramel. Hi. Council members, I stand before you as a deeply concerned resident and parent of this community. I found it troubling that instead of dedicating time to thoroughly research and provide respectful considerations for applicants of the majesty position of last meeting, a council member chose to use taxpayer funded time to insult a qualified attorney who chose to submit a letter of interest to continue serving the community. Council president is an acceptable practice to publicly demean applicants who are dedicated residents and taxpayers of our community. I find these behavior unprofessional, especially within this chamber. I took the time to carefully review all the resumes, including the one in question, to clarify both for this console in the public record. According to her resume and LinkedIn account, attorney Maribel Echeveria, Esquire has not been a bar attorney for just merely seven months, as you stated. While that is her Rhode island leisure date, she has been a licensed attorney in Massachusetts for over ten years, according to her resume. Her resume highlights a strong, dedicated decade of experience in various legal matters and a commitment of community service on committees appointed by the mayor and confirmed by this very council. Additionally, she holds a juris doctorate degree from Roger Lynch University. Council president, you stated, I don't know if she ever set foot in a courtroom last meeting. This question could have been easily answered and much more could have been learned from each qualifying candidate about what they bring to the table. If your ad hoc council members had conducted actual interviews, there should have been a more rigorous selection process for this simple appointment. And of course, if councilmember Clovis Gregor would have been assigned, he who is a licensed attorney had been on the committee, his knowledge and expertise could have been leveraged for proper vetting of the candidates. Last meeting, you also questioned Miss Ichevery's ethics when you stated on the record, I don't know the legalities of being a junior associate in a Ryland firm if you haven't passed the Ryland bar, but this suggests that she represented clients during that time. Regarding her work at the law firm of Morasco and Nesselbusch, you imply she engaged in client work before rational environments. This is a serious accusation unless you have depth and knowledge of law firm operations and specific facts. I caution against making statements that could jeopardize an attorney's career, or anyone's career for that matter.

I caution against making statements that could jeopardize an attorney's career, or anyone's career for that matter. Since we're on the topic of ethics council president, last meeting you stated on the record that the rattan bar made their own decision on placing Judge Kenyon as chief justice on paper and on the website. I took the initiative and contacted the Rylen bar directly. I recorded my conversation with them and they confirmed they do not make those decisions. Instead, the Ryland bar sends out forms to city clerks for information on sitting judges. So I ask you to clarify for the record, where did this error originated with the bar or the Pawtucket clerk? Because this inaccuracy has direct implications for your leadership and accountability of this chamber, I would like to also address another important issue concerning ethics. During our last meeting, you referenced a situation where the mayor had to make a difficult decision about terminating a prohibitionary firefighter approximately a decade ago. He also mentioned that this dismissed firefighter initiated a lawsuit and saw representation from his father's law firm. Notably, his father is a judge who is currently sitting in our city in whose firm agreed to represent him. I wish to draw attention to Rhode Island Code of judicial conduct, specifically application part three b. This section stipulates that a judge shall not practice law in the courtroom where they serve, appear as a lawyer before any municipal body that appoints to confirm them, or act as a lawyer in proceeding in which they have served as a judge or any related proceeding. This rule clearly prohibits judges from engaging in legal practice within their own courts under their appeal jurisdiction. While no laws were broken. This situation raises ethical concerns, highlighting a potential conflict of interest and the perception of inappropriate behavior, especially when a judge's law firm and or its attorneys are involved in legal proceedings within the same jurisdiction. These issues have been overlooked in 2015 1821 and as recently as last month. It is imperative that this council consider these matters in future discussions to hope your commitment to integrity and ethical standards moving away from outdated political behaviors as a former member of the United States army special forces, we received extensive training on leadership under pressure, respect for colleagues, operating with the utmost professionalism, and teaching our news members to be effective leaders. I have a personal connection to Jaco Wilking, a former military operator who is now an author, and I strongly recommend that the council president read his book extreme ownership. I'll leave you the copy here that the council president read this book. It offers crucial insights on effective leadership, respect for all individuals regardless of circumstance. Leading from the front, mentoring your newest council members with respect and integrity, and taking full ownership of actions under your command. I sincerely hope that this council has firmly apologized to its female members, was subjected to the council's president's disparaging comments about a successful woman in their own community. Such behavior is unacceptable and unprofessional, especially when a simple political process was openly questioned. Do you as a council want to be known for resorting to personal attacks on our constituents? Or do you want to demonstrate respect, professionalism and move forward constructively? As a resident of father, I, along with other members of this community, am deeply disappointed by what transpired. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Online Michelle we have two at this time.

So this is just absolutely ridiculous that public comments have been collected. There has been supposedly a revised conversion proposal put together by the city of Pawtucket based on these public comments that have not been made public. And the new proposal is also not available to the public. So there needs to be more transparency happening with this proposal to take Morley Field and turn it into Riverside park. And I could go on and on about it, but I'm going to just stop right there because it's been a long meeting. The big points are make the public comments public and put up the revised proposal. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Tierras. Okay. And that brings us to the final. I'm sorry. Bennett Evans, if you would. Bennett. Benjamin? Hello. Okay. Hello. Benjamin, if you would state your name and address for the record and then state whatever you wish to say. Thank you. Thank you for allowing me to provide some comments here in the public input section. My name is Ben Evans and I live in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. I would like to echo everything that my neighbors have said earlier specifically regarding Morley Field. There's absolutely no reason to replace Morley Field with a parking lot. JK equities apparently has promised that their scheme for a last mile distribution center will provide jobs. I have to say, everybody in Pawtucket is very skeptical of JK equities, given the way that they have treated the property that they own at one mishasek. It's outrageous the way they've allowed that property to damage the environment and the neighborhood, jeopardize the health of the folks that live there. They don't seem to care at all. And so I don't see any reason to believe any of their promises about jobs. And moreover, there's another distribution center which is owned or operated by DHL on the other side of Interstate 95. And the DHL facility, that distribution center, you know, apparently, according to their website, they're looking for drivers. They're trying to hire people. So, number one, I don't believe JK equities will actually provide jobs for the people of Pawtucket. Number two, we don't need their jobs. It seems like everybody who's looking to hire people can't find enough folks to actually take the jobs that are already existing. And specifically with that other distribution center, the DHL facility on the other side of 95. The other issue is, it's outrageous that time and time again, people from Pawtucket come and speak to this city council and they say, don't pave over Morley Field. Rehabilitate Morley Field. Reopen it so that the children of district five and the Woodlawn neighborhood have a place to play as was originally designed. It's shameful that the city has neglected that field. It seems like it's an intentional policy of neglect, including the closure of Morley Field as a way to make people just give up and abandon Morley Field. But people haven't given up. They continue to comment. I would echo my neighbor Anastasia Azore, when she says that you can't have a public comment process where the comments are not public. And that same goes for comments that are shared at the city council. There was an earlier Pawtucket resident who said, look, if you send in some comment by email, it just disappears. No one can ever see it. Those aren't available on the website. So it's an ineffective way of commenting. Same is true of the bizarre public comment process for Morley Field recently, which was a Google form and where people couldn't see the other comments. So it's a completely opaque, anti democratic process. It's outrageous. Nobody wants this parking lot, this last mile distribution center. As Phil west said earlier, we don't want giant trucks rumbling through the Woodlawn neighborhood. We want Morley Field. All of Morley Field. So I just would urge the city council to abandon its scheme to work with JK equities and save Morley Field. The other issue is this new revised conversion plan, which violates every principle that the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management put forth in their environmental justice policy. That revised plan is nowhere to be seen. No one can access it. No one can read it. It's another example of how the city council tries to block the people of Pawtucket from participating in government, from even understanding what the government is doing, because everything is top secret. It's outrageous. And I would just simply urge this city council to save Morley Field. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Evans. That concludes. That concludes the public input portion.

Mister President, I call for approval of the consent agenda and petitions for licenses, starting with the petition of James Montero to have a fashion show at 249 Main street down to cafeteria Bora Quinn on Broadway. The move. Councilor Ruto. Seconded by Councilor Moreno. That approved. Be given to items two and three to consent to vendor a petition for license. That would be starting with a. A petition of James Montero for a fashion show at 249 Main street. And actually, the last one on page two is international meat market on 479 Mineral Spring Avenue. Any items on the petitions for license that the members would like to address? On this side, Councilor Stacobia, the powerhome remodeling group. Daughter dawn reneal at the top of page two. Yes. This side. Counselor coder, item eight. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Then with the exception of item a and the door to door renewal, all in favor of approval? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries. Okay, we'll start with a since it comes first. Counselor, on item a. Since it's not a fashion show, it's an art showcase. What's the confusion with that? And instead of 08:00 p.m. until 01:00 a.m. i spoke to the event organizer, and we agree on from 08:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. that's the only change. Show. Yes. Instead of a fashion show, it's considered an art showcase. Art showcase. Still, with an 08:00 p.m. start time and 11:00 p.m. finished 11:00 p.m. yes. That's your motion? Yes. That is motion that's been moved by councilor Cody, second by councilor Rugio, that we amend that petition to list it as an art showcase and change the time of that one day license from eight to 08:00 p.m. from 08:00 p.m. until 01:00 a.m. to 08:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. any discussion on that motion? All in favor on the amendment? Aye. All amendment. All in favor now of approving license, as amended? Aye. Aye. Post motion carries. Okay, so you're all set? We're all set there. And then. Councillor Sokoviak, powerhome remodeling, group renewal. Yep. I got word from a constituent and resident that this door to door did not leave when they were given notice of a no, thank you. And our ordinance does state that once you are told no, thank you, you must leave their premise. And so this resident thought they were a little aggressive. And so, not that I want to hold back the renewal, but if we can just make sure with the renewal, if we can just reiterate the ordinance to them. So your motion. Hang on just 1 second, counsel, or were you just seconding that? I'll second it, too, but I don't have. Okay, so the motion is to approve the renewal, but for the clerk's office to send a reminder of the responsibility of the door to door folks relative to our local audience. Yes. Correct. Okay. And it's been seconded by Councilor Weldon Hayne. All in favor of. I'm sorry, that's not amending. So, any discussion, counselor? Yes. This group showed up at my house today and knocked on my door while my dog was going crazy. And I told him that I wasn't interested in solar. And then he reminded me that he's not solar. It's about vinyl siding and windows and everything else. I said I still wasn't interested, and he still wanted to stand there and quiz me on why I wasn't interested. And you're right. They're just like the solar people. If I'm not interested, just go. Just leave. And I like to remind that group, whoever they're hiring, it seems like they're hiring people now that they want to try and push you into a conversation, to having more. And I don't want our elderly residents subjected to that. In that case, would you consider it a friendly amendment if we also include that reminder from the cleric's office for Trinity solar as well? Sure. Yeah. Okay. In that case, all in favor? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries. We're on to item four. Councilor. Item four is a report on a March 6, 2024, city council license committee meeting regarding special event issues on Main Street. A motion to open up the to speak about it, moved by consular rude. Second by Councillor Sokoviak, that a report be given regarding tonight's license committee meeting having to do with special event issues on Main street. Councilor chairwoman Dakoviak, do you have anything to report, or. Yes. I thought so. The purpose of the meeting was simply discussion to make sure we're all on the same page. There had been a few licenses that had come through short notice, or we realized there were events going on that had not come for a license, which poses some safety issues. So I thought it was for us to get together with Leslie, who owns the property. She's the lessor to kind of talk to her about her responsibility as the owner in the lessor, and what our order or our state laws are regarding licenses and events and liquor licenses. I thought the meeting was productive. I think she had a clearer understanding now of the laws, and she also gave some suggestions when it comes to small businesses and how we can communi", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Pawtucket City Council", "insights": [{"observation": "No one can access the revised plan, and it is kept top secret, blocking participation of the people.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The council approved several petitions for licenses for events such as a fashion show and an art showcase.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There was strong support to save Morley Field.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "PowerHome Remodeling Group", "insights": [{"observation": "The door-to-door agents were aggressive and did not leave when asked, violating the local ordinance.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "A reminder of the ordinance will be sent to the company regarding their door-to-door practices.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Pawtucket City Council", "insights": [{"observation": "No one can access the revised plan, and it is kept top secret, blocking participation of the people.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The council approved several petitions for licenses for events such as a fashion show and an art showcase.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There was strong support to save Morley Field.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "PowerHome Remodeling Group", "insights": [{"observation": "The door-to-door agents were aggressive and did not leave when asked, violating the local ordinance.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "A reminder of the ordinance will be sent to the company regarding their door-to-door practices.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 3200582, "chunk_end_time": 3639714, "base_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240306a", "chunk_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240306a&iCurrentPosition=3200"}, {"start": 44000, "end": 50000, "text": "he to speak about it, moved by consular rude.

Any further discussion on tonight's meeting here accurately depicts what happened. Okay? In that case, good job, counselor. Okay, so we will move on to item five. Kennel license new. Hominy Rosado Lewis. 65 Patterson Avenue, license number 16184. Again, as advertised for public hearing. Kennel license new. Been moved by Councilor Aruja, second, by councilor Moreno, that a public hearing be convened regarding a new kennel license for harmony from Luis Rosado, 65 Patterson Avenue, license number 16185. I will declare the public hearing open. Is Mister Rosado here? Would he have known to be here? Because we had to move. We told him, oh, this is the public hearing, that he wouldn't. Okay, I got it. Okay. So we had to. We advertised this as a public hearing, which we were required to do, and then we had to move it after the fact. So, if there's anybody here tonight who wishes to speak on this application for a new kennel license in this public hearing, you're free to come up forward. Is there anyone online? Michelle? Is there anyone online who wishes to speak on the public hearing or harmony Kennel? Okay. In light of the fact that the applicant was told not to come here because we would still have to continue this hearing anyway and re notice it. I will accept a motion to. I'll make a motion to continue move by Councilor Moran, seconded by councilor Coder and consular Rubio, that we continue this public hearing. Any discussion on the continuum? Yes, council president. He's actually located in my district. I've met Mister Lewis and. Yeah, I don't have any position coming back here. No opposition to continuing? Yes. Okay, in that case, we will. All in favor of continuing? Aye. Opposed? Okay. We will continue the public hearing on the kennel license application. Item six. Item six. Communication from Captain Kenneth Dolan, Pawtucket Police Department, to the Paw City Council, Board of License Commissioners call log, happy Hour club, 404 Benefit street. Motion to file a communication. Second. The move by council. Second by Councilor Marin, that a communication from Captain Kenneth Dole and Tucker, police department, city council has the board of license Commissioners regarding a call log for happy hour club, 404 Benefit street be filed. Is there any discussion on filing, Mister president, in light of the information that was listed in this particular call log? There are some issues here that I've noted and I would like to invite the license holder in at the next meeting, the second meeting in March for an informal hearing to go over that with that individual. I tried to reach that person last couple days. Voicemail is full, so. But I'd like to bring them in anyway for a informal hearing. I don't believe we actually voted to file a communication. All in favor of filing? Aye. Okay, now, all in favor of calling the license holder for happy hour club and 404 beneficiary at the next board of license commission meeting for an informal hearing? Any discussion? All in favor of that? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries. Just 1 second, counsel. If anyone is here for a license, if you haven't heard otherwise, it was approved tonight. Okay. Okay. What's that? No further business coming before the board of licensed commissioners. I moved to adjourn and reconvene as the Pawtucket City council. It's been moved by Council Rouge that we adjourn as the board of license Commissions and convene as Pawtucket City Council. But before we do, I ask everyone stand and join us in the resuscitation of the pledge of allegiance started by Council Gregory. Allegiance to the flag. City council come to order.

So, Kovac, you're on both. You're. Both of you on the first page. We'll go there. Item B. So, item b, I just wanted to state, just professionally, I know that there's a lot going on. I'm sure we've been told there'd probably be lawsuits and everything going on with these new legislations, but I do support adus, and as a real estate agent, I've actually had a lot of people reach out, because those actually do seem like a good option for people to earn extra income, have extra housing, and also very important, a lot of people, older people, can actually stay in their homes this way. So I just wanted to say my support for Adus G. That's a communication from his honor, Mayor Donald R. Grebian to Scott avertesian, chief executive officer of RIPTA, on the proposed RIPTA cuts. I was just wondering, as a council, is there any. I mean, this was a great communication from the mayor, but as a council, if there's a resolution or communication, we can send showing our support against these RIPTA cuts. So I would say that there's no downside to that. I was going to speak on this one, too. I think it was mostly consular rujo who brought up the fact that when we relocate, for whatever period of time, city services to 100 freight street, that was on the bus route, but it is also possibly on the chopping block as well. So I would be happy to support such a resolution. If you'd like to put one together or work with the clerk's office. Okay, I'll work with the clerk's office on that. Okay, thank you. Item. Councilor Gregor, would you like to take ij l and M together or separately? Yes. It's because they really all related, right? Yeah. I, J and O. I'm sorry, I thought you said M. I'm sorry. I j. You know, I did say l and m, but those are separate. I, J. I thought you said l M in. Okay. And they're not all interrelated is what you're saying, right? L and M and okay, then I, J and O, J, and all seem to be interrelated. Yes. You want to take those all at once and then we'll move on to k, l and M separately. Okay. Okay. So item I is a communication from myself to the director, Carl charts and directive zoning for the city. And Jay is a communication from Mayor Bian to various government officials in response to the one Mach street property, repeated zoning code violations. And O is a communication from Ryan J. Holt, the new chief of staff, to the mayor, letter to council president Terrence Mercer. And again, response to the one mashasic street property owned by JK equities. So I'll start with o. So with o, Mister hall presents a letter from Chief Gonzales regarding what the police has been doing, trying to monitor the area. So I say, I do say thank you to the chief. And the police have been pretty responsive throughout most of this situation. We've been dealing with one moshe since they acquired a property that used to be the microfiber building. Sergeant Ashworth, way back, and this whole issue started in February of 2022, have been dealing with sending numerous and constant communication to initially JQ equities directly with little response, then to the DPW and then to the zoning directors. Various ones have been in charge of the situation. So when it suggested that they've been compliant or not a nuisance to the public health, that is entirely untrue. Starting again in 2022, counselor Melissa de Rosa and myself found that almost the entire side of the microfiber building on Main street, the boards that had been put up after they broke all the windows were laying on the floor on the street, and the area had a deep drop which created such an immediate urgency and danger to the public, anybody could have fallen there. That place, as everybody knew, was and still is highly contaminated. And yet zero action was done by them. I had to send a letter again to the director of zoning and urge them to go back and fix those boardings. Not once, several times. And this was in addition to all the trash that they would continuously leave around the property. So there's been very little change other than the fact that the building is now demolished and still creating a present danger and hazard to the people there the constant breaches of defense letters that they're talking about here, that they had to get someone, that community had to stay from the beginning of December past Christmas with a fence that was almost the entire side of Moshossa street was down on the floor. The zoning department has a responsibility to put up to not let that sort of thing happen. They could have easily have fixed up that fence instead of waiting for Jake Edwards to come down from New York and do it at their leisure. So that entire site had a continuous danger to the public and the children of my community all the way past through Christmas. The situation, not only with the remediation obligations that they have to keep that site up has not been barely done. Every time that they act is because they have to be told to act. So I would like to have them come, be called here so they can answer questions ab", "esg_v1": [{"name": "RIPTA (Rhode Island Public Transit Authority)", "insights": [{"observation": "Proposed RIPTA cuts may result in reduced access to bus services for certain city areas.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "JK Equities", "insights": [{"observation": "Repeated zoning code violations at the One Moshassic Street property.

The situation, not only with the remediation obligations that they have to keep that site up has not been barely done. Every time that they act is because they have to be told to act. So I would like to have them come, be called here so they can answer questions about what's going on with that site and why do they have to continue to put the health and well being of the children and the residents of Pawtucket in particular, the most affected community of district five in constant has it since they acquired a property. And this has been an ongoing issue. Repeated demands. Everything that they do is haphazardly done. After they finished demolishing that property, there was zero remediation preventive measure which they agreed to do in their own site remediation plan around the perimeter. There was no fence initially. Fence was subsequently added after things were brought up to them. This trash now, I mean, they went back, man was quick to act now and sent a letter asking that these things be done. Carl Johnson is that communications me for a couple of weeks now and has nothing regarding that trash. That trash didn't happen overnight. It's been there for well over a month and it's a constant hazard. That was not the second time or first time that I've contacted Carl Johnson. I do try to do them the courtesy of calling him first and asking him, just as I do with the DPW director, Chris, who responds and gets things done when it's on his jurisdiction. Carl Johnson ignores my texts. Carl Johnson ignores my phone calls. Karl Johnson ignores my emails. It is only after he's been forced to act that he actually makes a step here and he's suggesting, oh, they've been compliant. The fact that they've only received one zoning violation is astounding to me. Absolutely astounding. I'm not going to, I'm not going to get into all of the various other violations. But the site has been sitting since over a year now. Half demolished, a continuous present and immediate danger to the community. It is ruining businesses around the local area. It is actually, if they were supposed to correct the blight, alleged blight that was in the area, they've actually created blight for two years now. These people. The fact that excuses are being made all day. You have to contact someone to come here. Well, they have a responsibility. You choose to come to Rhode island and purchase a property to develop it, you have an absolute responsibility to ensure that it's maintained properly, that it's clean, that the community is not exposed to the toxins in the air from your demolition. The trash all around the property, I just drove up today. Yes. The trash behind ten rocks was cleaned up. And the trash around the primitive fence on Mashasset street was cleaned up. However, there is the other side on Greenville street. That is worse than anything I've seen over there that hasn't been cleaned up. Why? This is the sort of thing that they do, is everything's haphazardly done, and then you have to contact them again and then go back over there and excuses are made. This is totally unacceptable. It is because of them that Morley feel has been shut down for almost two years now for no reason. Why so? Because these folks need a parking lot in a place to dump their toxics before burying it. The Moshossa river is being affected. There's a lake in that property. And the prior trenches that were around the street, they claim, well, that's not. Our property was on the street, but somebody dug those trenches, and it was for the specific purpose of draining the property. The toxins that keep building up with all the heavy rain we have had, they've managed some. Some other kind of thing now that they're doing internally. But Majestic river is still being polluted. We're being polluted. Okay. I'm not going to say any more about that. Okay. Just before we move on, is there anybody else on any of these topics? Justin Ray. Thank you, council president. I just want to ask directly to Councilor Gregor. So are you. You're stating that Director Johnson has been either ignoring or not responding in a timely fashion to your calls or inquiries. So are you calling out his performance? I'm just curious because. I'm just asking that directly because if there's an issue with his performance, it sounds like it, based on what you're saying, that he. Maybe he's not performing the job duties that he should. That you should at least contact the mayor directly. I don't know if you've done that yet. Just to see if there's an issue with his performance and I'm just throwing it out there. I'm not saying. You're saying that it was just the way that you worded that. I get it. If you're not happy with what he's doing or responding to you, did you want to take that to another level? I just didn't know. No, I have no secrets. I know he's being directed. So I have an issue, Mister Johnson, because the prior director of zoning acted the same way. It's the administration that's controlling what happens in the city. Right. But are you then intimating that it's an intentional thing from the. It is absolutely an intentional thing that's being done there to create the vision that the area and our community needs jk equities to go over there and fix things up.", "esg_v1": [{"name": "JK Equities", "insights": [{"observation": "The building is now demolished and still creating a present danger and hazard to the people there.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "They had to get someone from the community to stay from the beginning of December past Christmas with a fence that was almost the entire side of Moshossa street was down on the floor.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The site had a continuous danger to the public and the children of our community all the way past through Christmas.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "There was zero remediation preventive measure which they agreed to do in their own site remediation plan around the perimeter.

Maybe he's not performing the job duties that he should. That you should at least contact the mayor directly. I don't know if you've done that yet. Just to see if there's an issue with his performance and I'm just throwing it out there. I'm not saying. You're saying that it was just the way that you worded that. I get it. If you're not happy with what he's doing or responding to you, did you want to take that to another level? I just didn't know. No, I have no secrets. I know he's being directed. So I have an issue, Mister Johnson, because the prior director of zoning acted the same way. It's the administration that's controlling what happens in the city. Right. But are you then intimating that it's an intentional thing from the. It is absolutely an intentional thing that's being done there to create the vision that the area and our community needs jk equities to go over there and fix things up. The plight that they've created, the pollution that they've created. But is there like. No, I guess my question is, you're saying it's being directed by the second floor. So if that's really happening. I mean, are you trying to reach out to the mayor's office directly to see what's the problem here? Like, maybe you wouldn't have to be doing this at every single meeting that we have. If you can get through to the mayor's office. Unless that's just not working. It just seems odd to me that. Are you the only council member here this evening? I can't get through to the mayor's office. I just don't understand that. I'm not going to debate. Your argument is contrary to what's being discussed right now. Because what's going on right now is the fact that we have a developer who is sitting for two years now, have taken our park, the field is closed, continue to pollute our area, and very little is being done about it. Whenever actions are required to be done, they have to be imposed. You have to call, you have to create a fuss. The degree in which they move to get anything done is this wouldn't happen anywhere else. Okay, so just to be clear, if there was a situation like that with a property anywhere else in the city, it would last a day. It would have been shut down and packed up. But because it's in district five with a vulnerable community, they're going to continue to do this, right? Because you're insisting on taking morally field. Right? And I think I've said enough on that subject. Castle, did you have any items? I mean, I just. I guess I share the frustration. Every week same issues are happening. I'm wondering if they could share some sort or create some sort of maintenance program around everything that's been happening to continuously make sure that that site is cleaned up and not just when we call onto them. That's all. That's an excellent point. If they're going to do business here, they should have an obvious. Should have someone handy to go around and inspect the place on a regular basis, clean it up and keep it as it should be for the benefit of the community. Would it be helpful to send communication to the director of zoning asking, I don't know the administration, but let's. We'll start with the director of zoning and perhaps copy Commerce, commerce on that, asking for what did you say? Some sort of routine maintenance. Routine maintenance or a remediation, yes. Inspection. Not involving the EM application or anything like that. Just routine. Correct. Even if it's from the city where we're routinely making sure that that site is being inspected, cleaned up, or contacting whoever we need to contact to make sure that happens. That way we're on top of it. Before all of these issues come up, we avoid an issue happening and we protect our community from causing a much bigger issue. Are you good with that, Council Gregor? Yes, I am. So the motion, if I take it as a motion. Councilor Rubio, secondary, if I may. I also like to get a status from JK equities regarding their intention. What is going on with that property as well. Okay, can we. I'll try to articulate and we'll wrap it into one communication. A communication to be sent to zoning. I mean, yes. Owning and code enforcement. Copied to the commerce director, as well as the principals or principal planning director. And the planning director. So. And the planning director, planning director, commerce director, zoning director. And copied to the contact person of the principal, J and K equities, asking that. So it'll be copied to them, asking that they cooperatively develop a routine maintenance plan for the property relative to upkeep, litter control, fencing, adequacy, propriety, whatever, and moreover, that. Well, maybe it should be that one correspondence to those three individuals and copy the j and K. Any discussion on that correspondence? All in favor? Then I'll take that as a second motion from Councilor Gregor, again seconded by councilor Rubio, that a correspondence be sent to the owners of J and K equities, asking them to provide us with a written update on their plans for the property at one Mushashuk. Anything in particular, counselor? Just an update. I believe they're supposed to give us quarterly update. I don't believe we received one for quite some time. Okay. If that's the case and we're supposed to get quarterly updates, and we haven't received the most recent quarterly update, a reminder that we want that. And a reminder that if indeed we've. I don't recall that being a mandate, but if indeed they are supposed to give us a quarterly report, that we do indeed want that quarterly report in a timely fashion. That work for you, counselor? Yes. Any discussion on seminal correspondence, Jane? Catholics? Counselor, can we add a completion date when they. When they anticipate a completion date of the project? We can ask.

Opposed? Motion carries. Okay, now we're back on to k. Yeah. Item k is a communication for myself to council president wanting to reach out to councilor Milos, see if he can reach out to the legal counsel of the Providence Worcester Railroad. I've been on the claims committee since my first time I was elected in 2018, and we see claims every so often. From that, we have to defer. We deny it and refer to the Providence Worcester rewrote. Because there's problems with the tracks. We have drivers in our city getting flat tires and damage. And again, the tracks are owned by the Providence Worcester Railroad. So we deny it and refer to the province Worcester Railroad. We had two a meeting ago, and we have one coming up that I can see on the communications. Again for a railroad problem. Driving over on, right across armistice boulevard by the DPW section, you could see a couple sections of the tracks actually coming up in between the tracks. Kind of had to avoid it. The object is to see if they can start a dialogue. And the hope is that maybe they can come up with some kind of corrective action plan to inspect the tracks that they have in our streets and fix them and then keep inspecting them on an ongoing basis. Because we get these claims a decent amount of time, similar to what we get from Rhode island. Energy. When they cut stuff in, a lot of our residents of it gets frustrated because they come to us, whether they're residents or just driving through our city, and they get damaged and then we're not culpable for it. But the folks that are, we refer to it. I'd like to see a dialogue start to see if the province of surveyor will start taking a hard look at the tracks that they have and fixing them. I even spoke to our clerk and he said he has to avoid something I'm on to sell a road. There's a little bit of wiggle with his vehicle. It's a problem. And again, this will be the third claim we've had in this short year dealing with railroad. So it's getting a little worse. I think it's time that a dialogue starts. And hopefully they're receptive, and hopefully we get some movement on that. So you sent a letter to me asking that I would reach out to. Are you still comfortable with me handling it that way as opposed to. Absolutely, I did. I did. Tell us list or I wanted to talk to him about that issue. I will get to him before the weekend is up and ask that he starts that dialogue and report back to us when he's able. That's sufficient. That is absolutely sufficient. I just wanted to bring that up to my colleagues. And if you had anything to add or you see anything like that, make sure you let council president know. And he can, you know, I know it's an ongoing thing. Sometimes I wonder how you wind up on their tracks. But there are other places where it's very dark. The darkness is another issue. The white line on the edge by the curbing is oftentimes faded. The other aspects you're talking about, and I'll bring that up to the solicitor as well. They look like they're metal. They're actually hard rubber. That's between in the roadways between the things. And I guess they do at some points come loose.

But also, you're correct. We see it all the time. You know, not all the time, but we see it often where people end up on the train tracks, you know, especially on a wet night like tonight. So.

Hopefully it works. If not, we'll consider what to do. All right, I'm fine with that, if that's good with you. Yes, sir. Thank you. L. Councilor Gregor L. Is a communication from John Blay, the recreational director, to the arm of members of Tucker City council. This is in response to request they had made to say, submit the yearly annual parks commission report. So I just wanted to thank Mister Blay for responding. And as I understand here from the letter, the report is not completed, and he expects to have it to us by April 10 of this year, minus things. The protochron are here. It's supposed to be due in December, so April 10 will be fine. However, in the interim, I'd like us to ask Mister Blay if he could provide us with a copy of last year's parks commission annual report. Thank you. You know, when you brought that up last meeting, I was on a park submission for a little while, a few years, and I was the chair. And I don't ever recall annual report being developed or sent off to the. The city council. I. When you said it, I'm sure it comes right from the charter, but. Oh, it does. I don't. You know, there are a lot of things we used to. We had a problem, not a problem, but the annual report from the police chief was a little bit ambiguous and was never given to us when it was supposed to be given to us. So I commend you for finding that and bringing it up. But I would not be surprised if there was not a full report for last year. But we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Well, I would still like to ask him for it because it would go a long way to explain what's going on with Morley Field if we had a yearly report explaining what the situation is with each part, what's being infested, what's being looked at. This is all part of transparency. That's an obligation that the park commission has to provide to the residents of the city of Pawtucket and the council. So we know what the situation is with our parks. A lot of what's been happening here with Morley and other conversions around the city would not be happening if we were receiving an annual report as to the state of the parks. So, council, are you comfortable if we just direct the clerk's office to ask for that in April? I think it's the one that was due last December. Right. He's. I guess what he's asked was the one before. Previous. Well, it's the previous December. Yeah. So we know this. The one that was supposed to be December is coming to come in April, late 2020. The question is, is there one for. That was due in December of 22, whenever it came in, did it come in and could you forward it to us, please? Yeah. They haven't done one. They don't have one. Forward. Forward that notion to us as well. Do they have any? Yes. Well, that's the thing. If they have none, then he could state that they haven't been doing it and, you know. Okay. We're good, though. We don't want to send an official correspondence. You're comfortable with them just asking the question of the director? Yes. Yes. Okay. All right, that brings us to the final one. Item m. I think that was you as well. Yes, it was. Item M is communication from Diana Lacy, administrative assistant school department, to Richard Goldstein, to the clerk, in response to the request, had suggested the council makes regards to Elizabeth Baldwin Elementary School in reference to engineering value reports that had been submitted to school committee. I'm not going to say much about it because I think Mister Pompelli, he was here, did articulate the issues with this. It looks like it's close to $2 million in what they're calling value engineering. What's the word again? Yeah, yeah. Value engineering report. And so what I'm seeing here is, and what I have an issue with is that Baldwin school has been long overdue to be rebuilt, and those kids deserve that. So this is a significant investment for these students, kids and a neighborhood which you would hope last into years and years without any issues and colier and whoever else comes over here and does these beautiful presentations with pictures and everything, promising everything under the sun that we're supposed to be getting.

There's supposed to be clouds along with the tiles. Yeah, it looks nice. The kids love that kind of stuff. Supposed to be in the agreement. Now they're saying, well, due to engineering, they can't quite fit the clouds over there. So we're just gonna have tiles going across. Well, that's an aesthetic. Things that matters. And people, the kids feel better when they're in an environment that they appreciate. And because it feels like people appreciate them.

It's been moved by Councilor Rujo. I mean, Councilor Gregor. Seconded by Councilor Sokoviak. That item for a resolution in support of the Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns advocacy for a passage of a Leo bore reform legislation in 2024 be approved on a roll of cordboard. Is there any discussion on this resolution? I'll just think of. Did you have something? No, no, I was hoping you would. So this is from the League of Cities and Towns, which is like the cooperative for each of the municipalities in the state, urging some sort of reform for the law enforcement officers bill of rights. There are a couple bills up at the state house right now, and this resolution is voicing the Pawtucket City council support for passage of those reforms to the law office's bill of rights. It's pretty much as simple as that. I think it's. I think there needs to be some sort of reform, and, you know, we leave it to the general assembly members to determine what level that should take. But a yes vote would be to support the movement or the support of League of cities and towns for such reform. Anybody else? Now that I've mentioned that, I'm just gonna say, is there any specific reform proposal? There are a couple dueling bills up there. I believe they're supported by the league again, which is the cooperative of the municipalities. So I don't know the particulars of each of the bills and which bill may or may not pass or if they need to pass in conjunction. But I think the general idea here is that we are, we, if we pass this, are supportive of the efforts to improve that bill of Rights. In that case, the clerk will call a role president. I'm sorry.

He would go down, he had a route in the Pawtucket area and even a good friend of mine came up to me and said, you know, he was my ice cream man as a. As a child. It was apropos at his wake today that they had an ice cream truck out there in his honor. So I would like to adjourn in memory of Mister Ronald Palaji.

Clark, can you call the roll? Council here? Council Rubio here. All right. We do have some public input. We're going to start with Chris Alvin from 94 Brookdale. Okay. You don't need to be. Okay. So we're going to over Chris. All right, next would be Lisa bead from 33 McBury Marbury. Thanks. I just wanted to give my absolute support to what's happening in downtown Pawtucket, the revival of life there, and what Leslie Moore and all of the business people are doing to make. I've lived in Pawtucket for 44 years, and I've never even thought about, you know, when I thought I needed to do something, I never thought of going to downtown because it had nothing to offer. I live in Oak Hill, and so when I discovered what was happening downtown with the buildings that were being bought and the businesses that were happening, the dreams that people were being given a chance to have come to fulfillment, I'm absolutely thrilled. And I go down there and it's welcoming, wonderful environment. And I wanted to just lend my support and say that the city council, I would hope that the city council would understand what an incredible resource that is and what a historic. It's a resurrection, you know, from the dead. And so I hope I'm not being disrespectful in saying that, but I do think that the city council needs to recognize, first of all, that everybody in council should go down there and experience it, because it's just a joyful place and it has so much to offer. So I'm asking for as much support from the city council as possible with all the licensing and all the knowing that there will be mistakes, because everybody is new at this. But that's what makes it so exciting, because people are being able to, you know, by making mistakes, we learn if we have support. So the city council, I'm hoping that the city council understands that and facilitate that. Asks, instead of being, you know, penalizing people, ask, what can we do to help? What can we do to make this vibrant place succeed? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Michelle. Anybody online? No? Councilor Rubio, can you take number two, please? Sure. Item number two, discussion with Main street business owners regarding issues with the requirements of special events, public and private, with and without alcohol and or entertainment on or within their properties in Pawtucket. Move to take this up. It's been moved to take up by Councilor Rubio, second by councilor Cordier, that we take up the discussion with Main street business owner owners regarding issues with and requirements for special events, public and private with and without alcohol and or entertainment on or within their properties in Pawtucket. All in favor of taking up this discussion? All right, so I guess I'll start. I think we're all in agreement that we're very supportive of what's happening downtown. I think what we're here to really just discuss is lately there's just been a concentrated sort of thing happening downtown where maybe it's cut their new edit or whatnot, but that people are just not following ordinances when it comes to these special events. Fire has gone by, police have gone by. There's been advertising of these public events with no licenses issued. So I think as more and more came and they seem to be centralized there, we realize, okay, maybe it's time to just all come together and discuss what's been happening there, a clarification of ordinances and proper paperwork that needs to happen, and just kind of all get on the same page. Because to us, we want to make sure that our resources are not going to be stretched thin if emergency happened and we didn't know there was an event happening, obviously that the proper paperwork has been filed for permits for alcohol sales. And of course, just knowing about events helps us to make sure that everyone's safe, the patrons, the business owners, people coming from outside the city. So I think we're all on the same page that we support businesses downtown. We just want to make sure that everybody's on the same page when it comes to safety and nobody's above the ordinances of Pawtucket. So I think that's really what this is about. So, Michelle, I know we, or Rick, we had talked about you guys would kind of give us a summary of lately the events that we kind of said no to and why we said no to them. What kind of brought this about? Well, there's really just a few issues. There's a few issues that need to be taken into account. One, wherever you're going to have the events, it's got to be approved by the fire department. You can't be putting people in danger by letting them into spaces that haven't been approved, haven't been inspected, aren't fit for the number of people that they want to do. So that's, I think the first thing. The second thing is the advertising. There's no advertising of events before you get a license. Because what happens is if for some reason that license isn't granted, and now you've got all these people having seen the", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Downtown Pawtucket Revitalization Initiative", "insights": [{"observation": "Lisa Bead expresses absolute support for downtown Pawtucket's revival and the efforts by Leslie Moore and other business people.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Lisa mentioned the importance of city council support to facilitate the vibrant downtown area's success.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The city council discussed issues with compliance to ordinances for special events relating to safety, fire department approvals, and proper licensing.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Issues were raised about events being advertised without necessary licenses, posing safety risks and non-compliance concerns.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Council emphasized the importance of ensuring that community events are safe and that all necessary permits are filed, stressing regulatory compliance.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Main Street Business Owners", "insights": [{"observation": "Discussion of issues with requirements for special events, especially regarding alcohol and entertainment, highlighting that events should comply with local ordinances.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Emphasis on proper paperwork and permits to ensure safety for patrons and community members during events.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The discussion reveals gaps in following safety regulations, such as fire department approved spaces, endangering public safety.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Council emphasized non-compliance issues with advertising events before receiving licenses, which could lead to public safety risks.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Downtown Pawtucket Revitalization Initiative", "insights": [{"observation": "Lisa Bead expresses absolute support for downtown Pawtucket's revival and the efforts by Leslie Moore and other business people.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Lisa mentioned the importance of city council support to facilitate the vibrant downtown area's success.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The city council discussed issues with compliance to ordinances for special events relating to safety, fire department approvals, and proper licensing.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Issues were raised about events being advertised without necessary licenses, posing safety risks and non-compliance concerns.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Council emphasized the importance of ensuring that community events are safe and that all necessary permits are filed, stressing regulatory compliance.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Main Street Business Owners", "insights": [{"observation": "Discussion of issues with requirements for special events, especially regarding alcohol and entertainment, highlighting that events should comply with local ordinances.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Emphasis on proper paperwork and permits to ensure safety for patrons and community members during events.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The discussion reveals gaps in following safety regulations, such as fire department approved spaces, endangering public safety.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Council emphasized non-compliance issues with advertising events before receiving licenses, which could lead to public safety risks.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 680, "chunk_end_time": 397786, "base_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240306b", "chunk_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240306b&iCurrentPosition=0"}, {"start": 4000, "end": 10000, "text": "just want to make sure that everybody's on the same page when it comes to safety and nobody's above the ordinances of Pawtucket.

Because what happens is if for some reason that license isn't granted, and now you've got all these people having seen the advertising, they come downtown, there's no event that could lead to trouble. And we want to stop that. The third thing is that these advertised events for 01:30 a.m. 02:00 a.m. 03:00 a.m. there is none of that in the city of Pawtucket. In Pawtucket, all events with alcohol have to be over, have to end by 01:00. Last calls at quarter one. Everybody has, all the patrons have to be out by quarter past and all the people there cleaning up and all have to be out by 130. So that's, and that's been a problem, this advertising of events. And not just in downtown, all over the city. You know, we're going to have a great event till 02:00 in the morning. Till three in the morning. I mean, that's, that's not Pawtucket. That's not what Pawtucket. I'm paraphrasing what I've heard from the council many times. That's not what Pawtucket wants to be. Pawtucket doesn't want to be province. We don't want to be open till 02:00 we don't want to have all, you know, these late, late nights. So those are like the three things that I see right off the bat that need to be addressed and can be addressed. They're not, they're not difficult. You just have to, you just have to do it. You know, you want, you want to own a lot of properties. If you want to allow events, you have to make sure that the fire go in and inspect them for places of assembly. They inspect them for being mercantile places because they run as a business, but then they want to have assemblies at night. Well, that's a different inspection. That's a different inspection. And you need to make sure that gets done. If that's not done, you cannot have the event. And that was the reason that the last events were canceled, because they didn't have the inspections for assembly. And I think, Michelle, I don't know if there's anything else that you think you need, but those are the three things that I see right off the top. If those things are corrected, 95% of the problems. Yeah. And I will say, Miss Moore, one of the reasons we thought it would benefit you to come in is because as the lesser. Right. Like, you know, we kind of wanted to see where your head was. Like, if you are always aware of these events, is there something in your lease about events? I mean, I think from my point of view, I kind of wanted to know as the person who owns it and is leasing out to these business owners who are then having these events, what your take on that is. So I'm really happy that we're here. I think there's just an issue that I didn't know. And we have a bunch of new businesses who also did not know that beyond getting a business license and having a space and being able to sell whatever you plan to sell at your event, that you also had to turn in this thing to city council. We just didn't know. I didn't know. And so I think in the last two weeks, everyone found out, oh, there is another step. Now, I also think that it hasn't been clear, like, where you go to find that out. I would like to tell anyone who has the space, and I do think there is this reality that downtown Pawtucket is a place where not everyone, in fact, most people are not thinking, let me just go there. And so these business owners are saying, this is so great. We've opened up a business, now we have to do something so that people are thinking, let's go there. And so they're having events, they're saying, come listen to music. Come do whatever. To me, I'm thinking, yeah, that makes so much sense. You're trying to get people to come to your space for an open mic, for whatever it is, you're trying to get people there. So I have thought that that's a wonderful thing. I'm excited. They're trying to get people to get used to coming down so that they can see their businesses. So, yeah, so I thought that was crazy. I just think people didn't know about this other step. And it sounds like tonight there's going to be a lot of folks there making sure that they're doing that step of requesting permission for that. I did want to talk a little more tonight about other. I imagine that there are ways to not have to every month say that you want to invite people to downtown Pawpucket, and I don't know what you do so that that doesn't happen for every time you want to invite people to come to downtown. I thought that would be really good because there may be something that I can do and spaces that I have businesses to get that kind of license or get those kinds of things done so that I feel like I'm not a great planner a month in advance. I can imagine that some folks may not be so great at that either. And so if there is a way to sort of cut that time down some, that would be helpful. I mean, I don't think there is. I mean, I think 30 days is actually very, this is just, from my perspective, very generous. And we do have a lot of organizations and businesses that do their applications for events in a timely manner, sometimes months ahead of time. So I don't know, Michelle, if you wanted, if there was, I don't. It's 30 days, right?

So I don't know, Michelle, if you wanted, if there was, I don't. It's 30 days, right? Like, yeah, so our ordinance does say that it's 30 days that you have to apply for in advance because it's, we're rushing sometimes at the last minute to try to get things on the agenda. They even talk about extending that out longer so that it could be 60 days in advance. So you'd have to apply because there's no promoting of an event. And people want to promote and they want to advertise and they want to post on social media and they want to post online and on event spaces that they're having this event. And they want to make sure you have all your permissions in order first. And it's not just a Pawtucket thing. This is state law that Pawtucket is following. So it is state law that it's required anytime you have an event. So I don't think Pawtucket has a choice in saying, no, we're not going to do it that way because it is state law. Any event that's open to the public that's providing entertainment has to get a license from their city or town, city council. So that's a statewide change if it had to take place. And then the other thing I just wanted to mention, because I know Rick was talking about the different times for last call for alcohol and stuff, entertainment in the city ends at 1230. And so just as part of that whole timing of things, you know, just the entertainment ends before the last call, before people leave. So it's, we had some events that were advertising entertainment starting at 1230. And I'm like, oh, that's going to be a problem for people that bought tickets when they show up and it's ending at 1230. And so we don't want that kind of confusion for the public. And so I know that, you know, we've had many conversations. You sat in my office and we've gone over the process for obtaining an event license and for when you need one. And I don't think so. I don't, I don't think we had those conversations because I feel like I still don't. I mean, I'm not the event planner, so I don't tend to ask the question because, you know, when we had those conversations at my counter or in my office, you know, for those types of events that wanted to be kind of promoted downtown. I've had those same conversations with other places in the downtown, and I'm happy to work with anybody to try to make sure that you get approved. You get approved on time. We want to make sure your, your events are successful. And so in the clerk's office, we try to go out of our way to make the process a one stop shop that, you know, everything is routed properly to police and fire, that we're getting those approvals to public works or if needed, and handling that all in one space. Years ago, people had to run around to all those departments and get signatures and do different things, and we try to consolidate and make it easier. We're going live online in another couple of weeks with new. A new system for that to make it even easier. But, you know, if there's any suggestions that the council has on how we can help, we'd be happy to do that. Yeah. And I think as a committee, we've talked about kind of coming together as more meetings as a committee and sort of working through that process. Councilor Corday, I had a question. The first question is, since it's my district, I just want to let everybody know that I am very happy what's happening with the other businesses there. They have the cafe, but before I go into that, is there a way, Michelle, that we can send Leslie a list of the stuff they have to take for before they have an event? Because that way, she can give it to everybody. And because I know that some of the businesses are under different names, different llc, and I know that they need a different permission. If it's another person, it's. So it's. It's there a way that you can make that list and send it to. So I did send the application to Leslie a few weeks ago when we were having an issue with the event that I couldn't find who was in charge of it. So I was reaching out to the property owner to try to find out who was in charge of that event, because I did see it advertised online, and so I did include an application for any future events. I'd be happy to send that again, one of the issues is there are different types of events that have different requirements. So there's not one list for every business. Some businesses, some events, they want to sell alcohol on their own. That's one event. Some want to bring in a class P licensed caterer to do it. That's different. Someone to have a private, you know, a private event, that's a different thing. So what I would suggest is anybody wants to have, have an event on your property, first thing you do is you tell them to come to the clerk's office. Don't stop at go, don't pass, you know, don't pass, don't collect your $200, come to the clerk's office. Before they do anything, they can tell us exactly what it is they want to do. We can tell them exactly what it is they're going to need.

We can tell them exactly what it is they're going to need. What type of event they're having will depend on what type of inspection they need from the fire department. Will depend on which licenses they need will depend on what, you know, what, what they, you know, what hours they can be operating. So that's the very first thing I would do. When somebody comes to say, I want to have an event. Or when you have with any of your lessees, tell them, because apparently a lot of them want to have events there, which is fine as long as they follow the rules. Just tell them, come into the clerk's office, talk to Ivona, talk to Michelle, talk to me, talk to anybody in there. We'll sit them down. We'll tell them exactly what they need to, need to do and how they need to do it. You're more than welcome at any of these meetings because I know we've had you in a few times to talk about these types of things. And, you know, maybe. I don't think so. Maybe. Well, I don't, I don't think I've been in your office to talk about how events work. I just don't think we. Then it's time that we have that meeting. We did discuss that you needed that. The only ones that could have an annual license for events were those that had a liquor license. So you can have entertainment for an annual license if you have a liquor license. And if you don't have a liquor license, it's on a case by case basis. Okay. So we did have those conversations. And because you just, I remember you said that there was not going to be any alcohol in the mall initially when you first came to see me, when we were doing the backyard and all the different, the stoop and all those different businesses, that I do not have any alcohol. That I don't. That you didn't want to have any alcohol. And so we talked about then that you'd have to come back and see me on a case by case basis for any events because there is no annual event license in those instances. Right. So I guess I just want to be clear. I feel like I'm saying it over and over again. I went to the office to get a license for food, to sell food. And so I said, I don't want alcohol. I wasn't talking about events. I just am not somebody who tends to plan events. Yeah. So we didn't have that discussion, but I thought it was like if you wanted to have music, you were going to have somebody come in and play you wanted to. And I said any kind of amplified sound would need an event license. And because you, you did want to incorporate music into part of that playing in the mall, just kind of being there. So it was some of those conversations that was early on. And then I think we sat again when we were trying to go over all the different things that were happening in the mall space. But it's these other spaces that are. The property owner should be accountable for what's happening in their buildings. And so that's why we wanted to. I mentioned having you come as the property owner. Then maybe it would be best to have you here. Yeah, no, I think this is good. I mean, I think everybody's getting a whole lot more clarity. I think so. But I do think the biggest issue that Rick said is the fire department. And as the property owner, God forbid something happened in those spaces. Right. And it was not approved by fire. It did not have the proper inspections. You had two or 300 people in a space and something bad happened. Nobody wants to see that. Right. And I think to me, that's actually the more concerning is, you know, how Michelle's saying, like, if, especially if we don't know about those events and then our resources, you know, fire police on a Friday and Saturday, they're not as stacked as you would think they are. I don't know if. Captain, you want to talk about that a little bit? Yeah. There was to have something to be happening downtown and there was an emergency. So our resources get taken up pretty quickly. And that's the ten people. And if we have a prisoner at the hospital, realistically we have eight. You have another fall, you may have seven or six. So an event that we're not aware of have four or 500 people practice pre exam pretty quick. Yeah. So I think probably where there's a little bit of a disconnect with me and I can imagine with some other folks who are in this, in this area is playing music. I don't tend to connect that with an event. You know, it's like, oh, that's just what people do, is they play music. But I'm like, oh, that's cultural we always play music. And so that may have been the conversation that when can you play music? When can you play music? And I do want to talk a little bit more about that. If there are times when you are playing music, what do you have to do to be able to play music? Is it the same thing you have to get? Yes. So that is what feels especially challenging for, you know, we're trying to have a cultural hub, or there's, like, music all the time and people are doing things. Is there a way to just be able to play music without every saying that every day we're going to play music? What does that look like? You mean either instruments or music, like a dj music or just the instrument?

You mean either instruments or music, like a dj music or just the instrument? Because I know that there is. Do you still have the, the practice with the kids in the piano and downstairs? Right. There's a piano down there. And people are always showing us all of their piano skills. That's maybe what the clerks need you to explain. You need to. It is either with the speakers, because that requires the license, or it's just playing the instruments downstairs. Are you talking ambiance? Are you talking? So I do. I mean, I do wonder where the line is. Is it, if you just are inviting people to come, then that makes it an event, or is it just the presence of music that makes. That makes it an event? Yes. So it could be a lot of different things. So on our application, we have, is it a concert? Is it a dj? Is it a dance? Is it, you know, it could be a carnival. It could be a circus. There's lots of different things. It could be. Right, of amplified sound, right is what the state law says entertainment is. So if there's any kind of amplified sound. Right, of any kind. That's why the only bars that can have music are those that have an entertainment license. Okay. And so a retail establishment that's selling clothing typically would only have what's called elevator music, which is kind of like that background music that you hear when you walk through a store that is a very, this is a cultural. Some retailers would have it, and it would sound like ambient music, and others, it would probably not sound so ambient, but so. And that is the thing that I do feel like, oh, man. I could see a little bit of trouble looming because people have different ideas about that. But I know that a couple years ago, we did talk at a city council meeting about this thing. If you had an entertainment license, that you could play music louder. But in Pawtucket, which didn't seem the same in every place, Pawtucket, you had to have a liquor license to have an entertainment license. Is that still the same? I was hoping, yes. What we're talking about, and the other ones are individual event licenses, entertainment license. I'm going to have a grand one day or two days. Right. And so I would really ask that we consider in Pawtucket an annual entertainment license that has nothing to do with alcohol. But that is saying, yep, you have applied and approved to play music. To play music. But if you invite a bunch of people for whatever reason, you put something on Facebook, then you have to let, you have to let the officials know or you have to, you know, go through the process. It's just. It does feel countercultural to me to not be able to play music without alcohol. You know, like without having to have alcohol with that. You know, it's just music is a part of so much culturally. So yeah, I do wonder is we talked about it before, has there been any more discussion about separating or just making the possibility when it does not have to do with alcohol being able to have sex? There has been no. Well, I thought in other places you could do entertainment without alcohol. You can do entertainment without alcohol. But you have to either apply for the, you know, even when they used to have, what was it, the theater, the Leroy theater, you know, in the gam theater they need licenses for their events, right. So there's, you know, under the state law, I don't think that there's. They still had to do it on a case by case basis at that time. Yeah, no, unfortunately, unfortunately not. Anybody else have questions on the committee? Mister president, you're allowed to. Any questions? No, I think we're talking about. I think we're conflating a couple different issues as we. You know, one of the examples that Michelle gave was music in a. In a store. You know, you're. It could be louder than you might expect in one store or another, but you're there to shop, you're not there to be entertained. You know, I think that's what the difference is. We're talking about entertainment. And that's why the state law says entertainment ends at 1230. Alcohol service, last call at 1245. Everybody out by 115. And even the people who work there, lessees, everybody has to be out the door by 130. No exceptions. Not I'm cleaning up afterwards and all the rest. I think the other aspect of that is there are venues down there, right? Different types of things. One, I think Mister Montero, his is an art gallery, right? That's the main purpose. If it were every Friday, Saturday 52 weeks a year of special entertainment. It's something different. It's kind of like a nightclub, you know, it's kind of like the Met Cafe, you know, a different sort of thing. If it's, if it's an art gallery, if it's some other sort of business model and you're having a grand opening, you have something whole different story that also. The state law also limits the number of special event one day entertainment license. That license is at twelve and again, twelve a month. No. Okay, events, there's no limit. It's just.

If you do get, not you, but whoever the applicant happens to be, you know, and I think part of the problem probably too is that you are the landlord and you have lessees who then, you know, so now you're one removed and two removed. As to who knows what's the. In order to have one of these events, you know, I think if you just look at it in your lessees, look at it as events, separate events and what they need to do with that, I think that will be a little bit better way to approach. And I do think people are sort of getting that and they're applying for that. I am trying to make sure we're getting a better sense of what is happening over there. And that is trying to push culture and a vibrant place where music plays and people are spending time together. And I'm hoping it looks and feels a little different than most other spaces that the folks go to. And so I'm really trying to sort of get ahead of it and question is it that at this point, because we're holding those two together, do I need to go ahead and get an entertainment license? And does that mean I also have to get a liquor license for different spaces? So that I hate planning events, but if I can just say it's a place that's very lively and fun and there's music playing and I don't have to send out invites. It's just people know that's what it is. It does sound like that would be the only way to go right now is to get a liquor license and an entertainment license. So that it's this idea of vibrant and people just sort of know it's a fun place to go. The thing you also have to be aware of is that you get a liquor license. It's what's called the class B license. It's basically a restaurant license. Yeah. To get a liquor license, you really have to open a restaurant with a functioning kitchen that's left by the department of Health and all around, because that has other requirements, like food all the time. But you get a liquor, you get an entertainment license for that with a class B, unless the council denied, but it's under the law, it's automatically yours. And then you could have an event. You can have events there, but what you can't do is move an event from, like, from one to the other across the street because there was an issue with that first location. I don't know what your involvement was with that or not involvement. Yeah. Are you aware of that? Or. There was an event. I think there was an event that was two weeks ago. People had things planned and realized, wow, there's a step. And they were trying to be considerate of people who they had made commitments to and said, oh, you cannot have it here. Try there. Try there. There was no sort of. People were just trying to make sure that they honored commitments. And I don't. I don't. You know, they were. And they didn't even know what the process was. They just were like, it can't be here. Yeah. And so I, you know, I feel like, yeah, everybody knows that. I really am just really wanting to make sure this is not deadening, sort of what has been momentum to sort of get people thinking about going there. And I also am hoping that. I don't think it's something I can do, but that folks who are here might be interested in thinking about what would have to happen so that music can be played, so that I don't have to get ten liquor licenses and open up ten cafes, so that this could be this fun, vibrant place where music is played. Like, that feels like there's just this very big disconnect with culture and that we have laws that don't totally connect with subcultures, and here we are trying to push a cultural hub. And so I'm really excited about that. I can see where there's a bit of a disconnect. I'm wondering if there's any room for that. But it does feel like on my end, if. If we do want to keep this sort of thing, that we may just have to think about that idea of having the liquor licenses with the entertainment. So that music is played more. But I do. It is not lost on me that events cannot happen after 01:00 and that people do need to go and to city hall and ask for those. And I'm not even pushing back on that. I just am recognizing some spaces. Oh, we probably need to think a little bit more about this hope that we've had and how to make that work together. We can't in a clerk's office change what the law is. That's for the council and for the General assembly, although you very well, we very well versed, I think now that we understand that it is a state law, it's not ordinances as the chair. It's set by state law for each municipality. So we can't just choose what we do. But they are very well versed. So if you have some thoughts, some suggestions of maybe we could move in this right.

Get them cobbled together, put them. Yeah. Sit down for 15 minutes or 4 hours and say, is this possible? Is this possible? Yeah, maybe this is, but this is. And maybe some, some massaging of the two. And maybe the answer is flat out is no. State of law doesn't state. Florida doesn't allow, you know, so I think, and I think my own personal opinion is that since you have a handful of lessees, that's where probably things kind of get away. You know, if it were just you and you were operating all of the businesses and planning all of the events, you would have your mind around, you know, you've got, you know, I'm a lessee and she's a lessee, and he's a lessee. And we have different ideas of what's what. You can see how there'd be a disconnect or something would fall rack. So that's why I was going to say, have your tenants, have your lessees come to our office. This is what I want to do. Can I do it? How can I do it? What's the best way to do it? Where can I do it? You know, with enough time. With enough time? Yeah, I mean, don't. Don't come in. The problem you get into is when you come in, people come in three days beforehand, one vent license, and then they find. And then they put it out there that they're having this, and then they find out they can't have it because they don't have time to do what they need to do to be. To be legal. And believe me, nobody wants to be going out there and shutting down events, because on these technicalities, because first of all, it doesn't create safe, a safe environment and it doesn't create a positive image of the city. That's why it's very important, I think, members of the council, if you do it right, we don't have to have those issues. And that's why I've been. I'm offering you as the landlord and your lessees to come in, talk to us and we'll go over it. We'll go over each one. You want to have. Ten different events will tell you which ones you can have and where you can do them and how you can do it. That's what we're there for. Councillor, I just want to say thank you for everything you're doing down there. I see it. I appreciate it. And as a business owner, I know how hard it is now coming from a business background, not knowing the right steps. And I think you bring up a good point that we really need to collaboratively work on is how do we create a sheet? Whereas, yeah, these are all the steps, but have something ready to hand out to businesses that we can support them through the process because there may be 20 people going to your office. But what if we create a document that we could supply all these new businesses who come from no backgrounds at all. So I think that that's important and maybe a discussion we could even have with commerce to support you in that process as well. When you come in for an event and we give you an application, part of that application is the list of things you need to do. But a lot of people don't even know that step to go to city hall to get an application. So what I'm saying is when she leases, just tell them to come see us, even if she's not, if they don't have a plan at the time. But why not? So we could get ahead of the game. We can try and support businesses with supplying a document that, or an online portal, whatever it is. That's the other thing is we're working on an online. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Pretty sure you're not going to be able to do it in writing. You're going to have. Then you'll be mad that you have to do it online. Right. As I'm thinking quickly, and only very quickly about the list. There's not a list. There are lists, several lists. So we can work on that we could consolidate and work on something. Yeah, yeah. But it's. Yeah, we'll have to think that through and do something that's not overwhelming. Online portal. Absolutely, yes. Putting you know. Yeah. Are you going to be doing gambling? Are you going to have a rambling? Exactly. Bingo. Then this is where you need to go. You're going to have a cocktail class. It's just. Yeah. Are you going to have people, you're going to have to have crowd control training from the state, you know, because you're having more than 50 people in a space. There's going to be a link, you know, so hopefully that's, you know, whatever we can provide on paper and online. Absolutely. And what I would also say, a lot of times it's better for the people to come in, speak to us because they can ask the questions, we give them the paper and they say, this is their list and that's fine, we can do that, we'll work on that. But sometimes they don't understand and it works better for them. That's why I'm offering again, have them come in and see us, talk to us. We can do it that way. And then if they, I mean, it doesn't have to be right away, but don't have them not come in to see us, because sometimes, sometimes that's the best way for them to get the information they need.

Councilor Cordair and please let me know so you text me and let me know so that way I'm aware of and I can advocate for you. I just want to say that I am a supporter of small businesses and these people are new in business and they are trying to reach their goals and their dreams. I personally and my husband, my family, we like to buy locally. We like to spend money locally. Almost every Saturday or every other Saturday I go to downtown and I walk around, I buy products at the skincare products. The lady that makes it, it's really good. Sometimes when I'm walking, I get hungry. I go to Mister Monteiro's Pixar that now you under construction. So. Okay, perfect. So I can go there. And I love your coffee, the sea cafe. My daughter and I, we went to the green area and she didn't want to leave and she's 17 years old. I'm like, you kind of fit for this. But yes, everyone there is so friendly, so welcoming and I really feel good. I think you, Leslie, despite the confusion and obvious, I know you guys are new and we are here to help you to understand and help you to succeed. And like I say, oh, and also I've heard that, I haven't seen it, but I've heard about the theater, that the families are coming and have storytellers and soon you will be having apartments, and so it's gonna be good for the city of Pawtucket having more businesses. I am a supporter of you as your councilwoman, and every time you need something doing, any event, please go to them. But you text me and let me know that you're gonna talk to the clerk's office. And so. And I'm sure they're gonna help you to go through everything and do the right thing. Okay? But I'm really glad with what you're doing down. Thank you. Thank you. Anything else, mister president? Clerk's office. I know. Fire. I don't know, chief. Or if you want to say anything before we wrap up, captain. Okay, then I'll just say that, you know, the purpose for this meeting, why we called it was to simply sit down, discuss, be on the same page. And I think we were successful today at that. And that's really great. I think we're all super supportive of small business. We love the change happening to downtown. And hopefully we'll just maintain this collaborative discussion and let your lessees know. Yeah, we're here to answer any questions, and hopefully we see them, you know, 30 days or before, so. All right, next on pizza, I'll take a motion to adjourn. To adjourn. Okay. It's been motioned by Councilor Rubio, second by councilor, that we adjourn this meeting of the license committee at 05:58 p.m. all in favor of adjourning? Aye, we are. I'm ready. Okay, I'd like to call to order the committee on claim impending suits to order on March 6, 2024, at 06:00 p.m. clark, please take a roll. Senator Rugio? Yeah. Council Moreno here. Three, and attends. Is there any public input? No. So do I have anybody joining us online that's here for public input? For the committee on claims impending suits, please raise your hand by using your raise hand feature at the bottom of your screen, or star nine. Joining us by phone. So, mister chairman, I have Brandon who's here. He's a claimant that's joining us online. Great. And I also have another person joining us online. Hold on 1 second. And so the person that's joining us by phone, can you state your name? Can you unmute yourself and state your name? Hi, my name is Brandon Barahona. Right. So I have Brandon, and then I also have somebody joining us by telephone. Angelina. Che Angelina. And you're here as a claimant. Gotcha. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. At this time, I'd ask counselor Moreno to take item two. Take the first person and councillor will take the second. Okay. The first one is John F. Allison. It is for vehicle damages in the amounts of $436 and $669. End. Fifty eight cents, I think. Move by council Moreno. Seconded by councilor Rubio, that we take up vehicle damage claim of John F. Allison for $436 and $669.58 for a pothole. So is Mister Allison here? Okay, so, as we saw the field inspection report, we noticed that, well, first and foremost, it was received. The claim was received on January 26. And the date of occurrence was January 23, which is three days, but well within our seven day timeline. And the field inspection report noted that on Friday, January 26, the pothole was found at that location. The two amounts, 436 and 669, 58, exceed our max cap limit of $300. However, we did find that there was a pothole at the location. Committee members, do you have want to add in or anything to say about this? No. So, any thoughts of what you would like to do? Motion to approve the 300. All the second at the motion by Councilor Moreno. Seconded by counselor Rubio, that we approve the claim vehicle damage of John F. Allison for the max amount of $300. Any further discussion? Boca Rugio? Yes. Council Moreno? Yes. Yes. Next one is Angelina for 200, 110, and $12.30 for a pothole. I move to take this up. It's been moved by Councilor Rubio, seconded by councilor Marino, that we take up the claim of Angelina Che. But she. I hope I'm pronouncing it correctly, for the amount of $212.30.

And my understanding is Miss Che is on the line tonight. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So we did notice that we did a field inspection report on this at 450 Utfield Avenue and near the Burger King restaurant, and they didn't see any pothole there. Now, the big thing that we. I see here, Councilor Milos, is it was received on the 24th, the claim of January. But we have a dated incident report of the 18th of 2023. Is that accurate? I have a timestamp, son che. I have a timestamp of January 24. And you're right. And it was a date of occurrence of December 18. So my notes show it's an untimely claim. All right, miss. Check. Can I explain? Sure. So, the day I hit the pothole, there was multiple cars that hit that same pothole before me and went into the burger tank parking lot. I had a baby in the car. And I called AAA, and they said it was going to be over 3 hours for a wait. So I started changing the tire myself. And some off duty firefighters came and helped me. And they told me that it was providence line to file it with Providence. So I originally did file it within seven days to Providence. And then it got denied saying it was Pawtucket. So that's why I filed it really late. Okay, so, miss Che, do you. First of all, I hope I'm pronouncing your last name correctly. Did you. Do you have. Would you be able to supply proof that you claimed to put the claim into Providence? A date? Because we have a seven day max window of making a claim. But if. If you can provide even some type of documentation that you put a claim in with Providence, then, you know, we. There may be a way we could, you know, approve it based on your claim, based on seeing evidence that you. You put in a claim with Providence. The only thing I'll point out, because as you already have indicated, the field inspection report doesn't. Hasn't determined the existence of potholes. So even if we deem it be a timely claim. Right. Maybe. I don't know if Joey's here for that. Maybe he has some additional information on that one. Sure. And this is pretty clear from the field inspection report, they couldn't locate a pothole. So. Mister Wilson, do you think. You know, there was no. There was no pothole noted in January, a month after. But it doesn't say if they saw one filled at all too, either. Right? You just didn't see one? We didn't see one. This 458 Smithfield Avenue. I believe there is a 458 Smithfield Avenue in Providence as well. Yeah, she filed claim Providence. And they told her that it wasn't theirs, but yet we drove. We drove Pawtucket and Providence and we did not see anything, but definitely nothing in our jurisdiction. No, we did not. We did not see any. We did not find. I mean, an experience shows our public works folks, if there's a pothole out there, they tell you this pothole. They'll tell you what they did measure. We even went to. I'm just surprised that all the other cars that had a flat tire the same time as me didn't file one location. I don't think so. I. We have other. We'd have to review that Burger King that this happened. We don't license. That's problems. That's Providence. Yeah. Yeah, we drove the. We drove the problem. So I'm not sure why Providence is telling her that. So it does sound like as we're discussing your claim is Che. It seems like it's a Providence location. Because if it happened in front of the Burger King. You know, our city clerk just mentioned that we don't provide a license to that Burger King, meaning it is a Providence location. It's over the city line. So it does seem like it happened in the jurisdiction of Providence, based on. On what we're seeing. And it's. It's right on the line. I know, because I drive by that Burger King all the time, and it's. Right. You know, I'm not. I didn't know if it was talking to Providence, to be honest. Yeah. Okay, so. So we can't pay for something that's not within that jurisdiction, even if we deem it to be a timely plan. Right? So I think, you know, at this point in time, we may be looking at, you know, if you may want to look back and reapply this claim with Providence, knowing that Burger King is a providence location, trying to find out if that Burger King is licensed by the city of Providence. Some kind of proof that it's a providence. Right, but you and you. And we're certain we don't license them, right? Yeah. 458 Smithfield Avenue. Providence is the location for that Burger King. Okay, so it's definitely a providence location. Okay, I'll call again. Maybe they gave me the wrong information. Well, yeah, and, you know, yes, definitely. That's why, you know, I'm glad that we had the clerk here and our public works supervisor here, so this way, we can discuss it and try to give you a clear path of, you know, where you can go to, you know, to submit the claim, you know, accurately.

Some kind of proof that it's a providence. Right, but you and you. And we're certain we don't license them, right? Yeah. 458 Smithfield Avenue. Providence is the location for that Burger King. Okay, so it's definitely a providence location. Okay, I'll call again. Maybe they gave me the wrong information. Well, yeah, and, you know, yes, definitely. That's why, you know, I'm glad that we had the clerk here and our public works supervisor here, so this way, we can discuss it and try to give you a clear path of, you know, where you can go to, you know, to submit the claim, you know, accurately. So you're very welcome. At that point, I'd obtain a motion, make a motion to deny flame. The motion by Councilor Rubio. Seconded by councilor Moreno, that we deny the claim, based that it. The area was a providence location, not call. Yeah, Moreno. Yes. All right, next up is Eddie and Christensen in the amount of $319.32. It is for a second move by council Moreno, seconded by councilor Rubio, that we take up the vehicle damage claim of Betty Ann Christiansen for $319.32 for a pothole. Is Miss Christensen here? Okay. Um. I know, I've been taking leave. Guys. Want to speak to. Okay. Uh, it appears that this is a, um. A state. This is maintained by the state of Rhode island. This area. Is that accurate, right? Yes, it is. Okay, so we don't have, you know, that that would be something that it's been my experience that we normally denied such claims and, you know, refer to the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. Yeah, transportation. Is that what we normally do, councilor miles? It is many. Do you have anything to add or say or any thoughts on this? I'll second what you said, and I'll make a motion to deny and refer to the Rhode island dot. All right, it's been motioned by councilor Rubio, seconded by councilor Moreno, that we deny the claim of Betty Ann Christensen and refer to the Rhode Island Dot. May other discussion click local? Yes. Yes. Next one up is usually. I'm sorry. Okay. And Heather Depina, for $172.79 for a pothole. I am to take this up. It's been moved by Councilor Rubio, seconded by councilor Moreno, that we take up Euclid's. Euclids, is that correct? Euclids inhabit the pena for a pothole in the amount of. 172. $172.79. All right, motions them to take it up. Okay. Field inspection report. They did locate a pothole, and this was received by the clerk's office on January 30, and the date of incident was January 28, so two days later. Do you have anything that you would like to speak to on this? No. Who approve of the amount of 172,902nd. There's been a motion by Councillor Moreno, seconded by councilor Rubio, that we approve the vehicle damage claim of Euclid. To my apologies, Euclids. And Heather, the pina for the amount of $172.79. Any further discussion? Correct. Well, yes. Yes. Johnson. Rubio. Yes. All right, thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. And thank you for coming tonight. You as well. Take care. Next up is Ruthie and Joseph in the amount of 210. Where's. It's Otto? Would we like to take the other one, too? Ruthie and Joseph White and the others? Second. So, motion by councilor Moreno, seconded by councilor Rubio, that we take up the two claims of vehicle damage from Ruthie and Joseph White. The first one for $210 for pothole, and the second one was for $110 on a pothole. Okay, so the motion was to take up. Yeah. All right, so we have the first one was received on February 5, and the date of incidents look like it was 130. All right, yeah, it looks that way. Right? It looked like 27, but then he changed the 30. Um. Okay, but is that. Am I reading that correctly? What 30 was here? Yeah, down here, we're signed it signed at 127. Right. And then we received it the fifth, so. Yeah. And I have that. I have that circled as well. I did see there was a disparity. So if it was on the 30th weather within the five day window. However, on the 27th, we would not be. However, as we look at the field inspection report done on February 6, Mister Wilson and Mister Travis had responded out to the area and they could not locate any pothole in that area. So they asked if we could provide better pictures of the location. So what's confusing about that first one is it signed and dated on a 27th for an occurrence three days later? That's what I said. Yes. Yeah. So doesn't make a lot of sense. It looks like this was changed. It looks like the date of occurrence. Yeah. Was 27 the 30th. Yes. But yet it was. Looked like both had been 27th, so. And in addition, we couldn't really locate it. They couldn't locate. Yes, neither. Okay. Any other occasion? Yes. And since we took it up, council miles well within a right to take both up at the same time. Right. So if you look at the second one for the $110 claim number two, that one has a date of receipt of the clerk's office. On the fifth, it looks like it has 1129, but it signed 127. Unless that was a 127, they just inadvertently vote 29. And so again, there's a little area, gray area here. What, that actual date was based on the signature where eight days removed. Correct. Except 28, 29, 30th, 31st day, late daylight. Right. And they both could not and again, could not locate a pothole in that area. Based on the field. I agree. So it appears that at least on one, it's untimely. Both you can locate it. What? Do you have anything you would like to. No, I mean, it's. I'd agree with both ends. It's late and we couldn't locate a pothole. So unless we get more pictures in an actual update, I've moved to deny the claim. Okay. Then moved by counselor movie or seconded by counselor Marino that we denied both claims of booth and Joseph White. One in amount of 210 and one in amount of 110. And if they.

Well, I mean, they could always ask the committee to reconsider, consider based on evidence. But then the date. My thing is going to be an issue, at least on one of the two. All right. Just want to make sure we, you know, we're doing. Covering everything that we need to cover. Okay with that? The motion's on the floor. Correct. Can you take a vocal, please? Yes. Yes. You're killing me with the names here today. I think so. I hope I'm kind of for a pothole of 301 with twenty cents. I moved to take this up. It's been moved by Councilor Rubio, seconded by councilor Moreno, that we take up the vehicle damage claim of vying Giannakis for an amount of $301.20 for a pothole. Emotions on the floor to take it up. Is Mister Giannakis here? Okay. Okay. So this basically said it was a cutout done by Rhode Island Energy or magic gasoline. They were notified, a 129, that the cutout needed to be refilled. They responded and refilled it. So normally under a case like this, we refer the claimant, um, to island energy and we deny it on our pop. Um, this is one of numerous times that we get these things from an island energy. Wish they were doing a little better job with that. But that's a discussion for another day because, you know, this definitely a discussion for another day. Um, so what happens with Rhode island energy at this time of the year? Um, they can only do a temporary patch. So it's not your permanent patch. They have to wait so many days for it to settle. So what they'll do is they'll come through our city and blitz it with all the cut offs from the winter, or if they were ready to be filled for the amount of time that they've settled, and it'll be a permit patch. But when they first come out, it's just a template. So is that called what a cold patch is versus the hot? That different or at times they will use a cold patch. Yep. But depending if the plants run in, they will run a winter mix, which isn't that fine. It's more bigger rocks, so it's considered a temporary. A temporary patch. So, you know. Um. Okay. I wish, you know, and I guess sometimes too much time elapsed and, you know, maybe the weather has something to do with it, depending on how cold, how warm it is. All right, well, you know, maybe we'll have to consider reaching out to them and coming up with the plan of action where it's checked a little quicker so these things don't happen. But in the meantime, we're faced with this claim right now. And so I'll entertain any more conversational or any type of motion. All right, move to hi and refer to Rhode island energy. Second. Okay, so it's been motioned by councilor Marino, seconded by councilor Rubio, that we deny and refer to Rhode island energy to claim vehicle damage claim of vangus in the amount of $301.20. Any further discussion local, please? Yes. Yes. All right, next up is Brandon A. In the amount of $189.58. And it is for a second. All right, then move back constantly. Take it a second by Councilor Rubio, that we take up the vehicle damage, uh, claim of Brandon A. Barahona for the amount of 189. 58. And my understanding is, Mister Barahona, you're on the line, correct? Yes. Oh, there you are. Sorry, I keep looking at the computer. I forgot we have the speaker here. So, you know, as we're looking at this report, Mister Barona, we. This is similar to the previous claim. When our field inspection was done, it was found that there was a cutout done by Rhode island energy, I guess, you know, for an emergency gas leak. And we, the city VPW, reached out to, mentioned to them about the cutout and there was an issue with it and they came out and patched it up and fixed it. But this is something that, because it was a religion, what they did, we. We would generally deny this and refer the claim to them and, you know, give you their information on how you could, you know, file a claim with them. Okay. Right. Did you have, you know, only because, you know, that's it's something that, you know, how would you wear that council miles as a liability? Because they the ones that did the cutout. Yes. As far as we're concerned, when we're not culpable, we didn't actually create the defect. Okay. Although we have a duty to maintain our roadways, we have to know that the defect existed under the circumstances. We did not until it was brought to our attention. And then again, it wasn't us. It wasn't one of our agents or employees that actually caused the defect. So it should be denied. Right. So what we'll generally do, Mister Baroness, is we will deny this and then have you reach out to Rhode Island Energy and put your claim through them because they were the ones that did the cutout in the road. I will put my claim on Rhode island energy then. Right. But do we usually give that information to that? We'll send out a letter telling what happened and we'll put in their contact to Mister Baronas or the rail energy, Mister Daron. All right.

All right, it's been motioned by councilor Rubio and seconded by councillor Moreno that we deny and refer the vehicle damage claim of brandon A. Barajona and the amount of 189 58. Any further discussion? What? Could you take a roll call, please? Yes. Next payment is Mary Amaro for an amount of 489.87 for exposed water pipes. Uh, I make a motion to take this up. It's been moved by councilor Rubio, seconded by councilor Marino, that we take up, um, the vehicle damage claim of Mary Amarol in the amount of $489.87. And this was for an exposed water pipe. Okay. All right, so as we look at this, the inspection. Field inspection was done on Thursday, February 2. Um, and see here first. Okay. And, um, they were approached. Uh, note that it seemed like this was a water supply issue board. A water supply board issue, correct? That is correct. It was a water gate cover that was, um, broken in half. We contacted, uh, mark Ponce's supervisor for that division and sent a crew out to replace the Watergate cover. Okay. All right, so it sounds like it's definitely something that was that we need to refer to them because that was their issue. Anything further? Make a motion to deny and referred to the protected water supply board. All right. The motion by council Lubio, seconded by councillor Moreno, that we deny the vehicle damage claim of Manny Amara, Mary Amaral in the amount of 4987. Deny it and refer to water supply. Any further discussion? Could you take a roll, please? Yes. So item number three is property damage on the first claim, even Hamilton's end. There's an amended agenda. Sorry, do you have. Did you have extra agendas? Yeah. Okay. And there was an additional claim added. Uh, Elida gone costs. And do we have the documentation on that? Yeah, the field inspection is there, but we have a. Right, right, right. Yes, yes. So I'll do that. Yeah. Oh, it's under the alive. Oh, here. No, but it has no amount specified. And there's an amount. Now, there was an amount at the time, but we did get an amount. This is all words to share. Okay. Okay. So I remember. So the tax and travelers in insurance in the amount of $1,145. Okay, so it's been seconded by councillor Rubio. Right. Second. Okay. It's been moved by councillor Moreno, seconded by councilor Rubio, that we take up the vehicle damage of Eli to Gonzalez by travelers insurance in the amount of $1,145.16. The motion is to take up. Councillor Milos, did you, you have this information in front of you? I do. I see that. Fires here, too. I'm just a little bit confused. Just based on my reading, the field inspection report, it's unclear to me if we side swiped a parked car. It sounds like there were parked cars to the right, but this car was in motion. So the car was a motion. Was it while the rescue had its lights and sirens on, or was this. Yeah, it was three times off the side. There's one car approaching. When they were going through, the car pulled over but was still in motion. Okay. Didn't pull over far enough. Basically did not pull over far enough, but it's got this something I need a little more time for the police here. We have a police report on this. Anyway, this was a film. Jasmine mustard. This one was just added Monday. Yeah, I was going to say it wasn't in the claim packages when I looked at them. This was added Monday. We kind of held it because we didn't know if it was going to be over the $2,500. Oh, yeah, I know that, Michelle. Want to make sure we get it on tonight. I mean, I have no problem with that, but I think we've seen in any plan in 36 years. Those pictures are, you know, useless. You know, council Milo says, you know, you've been in the solicitor. Do you think we have, you have enough to rule on us or would you like to postpone? I'm looking at the police report now. I mean, it's. You have both drivers basically obviously agreeing that their vehicles came to contact. Operator one, who is the claimant, basically states she was traveling westbound Russo street. She claims she moved to the side of the roadway to allow the rescue to pass. She states, though, that notwithstanding that as vehicle two passed her, the rear bumper of the rescue scraped the rear bumper, causing scuff marks. The operator of the city's vehicle said he was responding to a call from westbound on Rousseau and does concede that the railroads struck. I think it really comes down to did the claimant do everything she could to move over to the side of the road? And if she did, then to me, it's probably more of a 50 50 case than anything. If she didn't pull over, if she didn't follow the rules of the row, when there's an emergency, at least attempt to do so, then I would say there's no liabili", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Rhode Island Energy", "insights": [{"observation": "Discussion about referring vehicle damage claim to Rhode Island Energy because they were responsible for the defect in the road.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Protected Water Supply Board", "insights": [{"observation": "Exposed water pipe issue referred to the Protected Water Supply Board, which sent a crew to replace the Watergate cover.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Travelers Insurance", "insights": [{"observation": "Discussion about vehicle damage claim involving a rescue vehicle and another car, indicating a potential issue with following traffic rules during emergencies.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Rhode Island Energy", "insights": [{"observation": "Discussion about referring vehicle damage claim to Rhode Island Energy because they were responsible for the defect in the road.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Protected Water Supply Board", "insights": [{"observation": "Exposed water pipe issue referred to the Protected Water Supply Board, which sent a crew to replace the Watergate cover.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Travelers Insurance", "insights": [{"observation": "Discussion about vehicle damage claim involving a rescue vehicle and another car, indicating a potential issue with following traffic rules during emergencies.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 4730240, "chunk_end_time": 5261204, "base_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240306b", "chunk_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240306b&iCurrentPosition=4730"}, {"start": 59000, "end": 65000, "text": "ve enough to rule on us or would you like to postpone?

So that's really what it comes down to. So I'm unclear. Did she do everything she could. We might need a little bit more, maybe from the actual driver of the rescue, from his perspective anyway. You know, would the claimant have done something more than what she did? Because sometimes you get pinned. I've been in a situation where there's a rescue coming and you don't know what to do, and you pull over as far as you can. I guess the only alternative is to go up on the sidewalk, if you can, in some situations. But I think we would need to know that. So it sounds like the claims committee would need to know that before you could actually rule on this. And to me, I would think, based on what your opinion, and based on, even though it came to us on Monday, I'm thinking maybe we postponed for further sure and maybe get a statement or some type of narrative from, not a sworn statement, but something from the driver to the extent that he can, to maybe offer a little bit more factually in terms of could this claim and have done something more in his estimation. I'll get that for you. I appreciate that. Thank you. Thanks much. So at that point, I'd entertain a motion. Second. All right. Promotion by councilor Moreno, seconded by councilor Rubio, that we postpone the vehicle damage claim of Alita Gongals and buy travelers insurance for the amount of $1,145.16. So the next claim meeting would be month from now. Basically the first meeting in April. Okay. All right, that's the one. I need that. Okay. Item number. Item number three. Property damage. Stefan Hamilton from fair Value Rentals, LLC, for the amount of 1870 for a sewer line collapse. I make a motion to take this up. It's a motion by Councilor Rubio, seconded by councilor Marino, that we take the property damage claim of Stephen Hamilton, Fair Value Rental, LlC. Any amount of $1,870 for a sewer line collapse. Motion is to bring it up. Is anybody here from that? Is that you, Stephen? Mister Hamilton. Okay, great. Okay, councillor Milos, if you arrive, I should have done it. So, yeah, Joey, from your perspective, based on what we do, folks did, this is basically our issue. Well, I was off that day. I was filled in. When they came back, we went out, we responded for a sewer backup. Typically, if they don't have a clean out, we can't help them. They have to call a plumber. In this particular case, the gentleman did call a plumber. They reversed, jetted. So what they did is they went into our manhole and sent the high pressure line back into the property. Looks like we used the camera, too. We used the camera. We used the camera after the fact. Yeah. And we saw a. We saw a break in line. This could have happened from the amount of pressure from the jetted line. We were not on scene when they accessed our sewer main. Okay, so you can't say it's public works perspective. It was the break in the line that caused it back up. I cannot, because we would not call. We would not call when the plumber was on seeing reverse jet the line. If we were there, we could have done a little more investigating. But there's no question that there was observe a break in the line. You're just not. You're not able to state, based on your experience, whether that did in fact was or contribute to the backup or not. That is correct. The. So that. The concern that I have here is that that pressure from that hose gives so much psi that it could crack the line. But I don't know if that crop was already there or not. According to the claimant, the Reuter company that was called, they opened the cabin street. They found that the line was covered in sand. As the only other piece of factual information to me. Right. In terms of trying to figure out whether the city was at fault or not. What do you think based on that information and certainly the claimants here, I was not there when they popped this cover. I'm not sure. Stephen. Yeah. What it comes down to on these is sometimes we come to a conclusion that we're liable if we feel that through our action or inaction, we may have contributed or caused what you ultimately experienced. Kind of tough when we're not out there on the sure. If we have some of that up. You have sinkhole that formed over the sewer line in June that you guys had to come out with built clear it up. Ten days prior to this, I did call saying I had an issue where I did jet from the inside of the property. We had to put the jet in almost 100ft, which is outside of the property. When we did that, I was informed that it was too late and I guess shortage in your sewer department. There's only one guy who does field work, as opposed to four usually, are there.

Kind of tough when we're not out there on the sure. If we have some of that up. You have sinkhole that formed over the sewer line in June that you guys had to come out with built clear it up. Ten days prior to this, I did call saying I had an issue where I did jet from the inside of the property. We had to put the jet in almost 100ft, which is outside of the property. When we did that, I was informed that it was too late and I guess shortage in your sewer department. There's only one guy who does field work, as opposed to four usually, are there. His understanding. My understanding was they would come out and at least pop the COVID the next day, which they would have seen all the sand be jetted out of the line, which would have shown them that there was a collapse. But his understanding was if you didn't hear from me in the morning that they were just going to go out there and drive by. Which did you pull the cab? You can go through and probably find the call records to either the fire station or police station on the evening, I believe, of the 18th, which might be in the report there, or might not, which was ten days prior. Not asking, being reimbursed from that general. We did it from the inside of the property. We couldn't get a camera in access 90ft in to see where the brakes were, because they were so far out. The brakes that were there were evidently. Secondly, pop, when the whole line is covered in sand, we had to watch just the end of the line, where it ejects into the main sewer line in order to even access that line of the camera. When we did jet, he didn't have to jet. He just put a little bit of pressure to it, pulled it out to put the camera in. The brake was within 2ft of the sewer line, sewer cap in the sand. So my issue is the inactivity is they should have gone out there and investigated the ten days prior. If not, they should have probably investigated by there was a sinkhole and up over the sewer line, or within 2ft, sewing along that review. So my understanding is they did pop the COVID When I got involved, I set up for our vendor to come in. When we put our camera in, I saw a break. I immediately called our vendor, who was out on one two, to repair this line. Stephen still does not have a clean out, so in the future he may run into problems again. Sure. But so the committee can make a proper decision. You heard the statements from the gentleman. You don't have any reason to dispute what he's saying in terms of what he saw. Every sewer has dirt. Every sewer has sand. That's where it goes. I can say that I did see a break with our camera and we repaired that break. Was that break there prior? I couldn't tell you that. But when we did put the camera in, we did see the break, and I made a decision to call our vendor in and repair that line immediately. Would be there was a sinkhole, Mister Hamill Hamilton was saying, so could that cause the break as well? The sinkhole, I mean, wouldn't happen. It's pushing through the cracks, going under the pavement and pushing sand down into my line. That's where all the sand is gone. Look, I can only say that I've seen a lot of sewer claims, and I know the ones that I wouldn't mind defending in court, ones that I would. This is not one I think I would want to be defending in court based on all of the information that claim is offering tonight. Did you have something possibility. I know you had. No, everything just kind of clarified. I just had a couple questions about what was happening. But yeah, no, I'm good. I'll entertain a motion. I'll make. I'll make a motion to approve. Have to say that we did motion by council. That's right. Absolutely. Any other further discussion. I'm sorry, I do have a question. When this happens, procedure for when what happens when this type of situation happens, are they able to take the cap off and if kind of. So the. The sewer main is the. Is the property of the city. So we can, for them to come in and access that manhole cover, they need to notify the city. Okay, because it's the city's property. Just like we can't go onto the gentleman's property without his or hers permission. Then we don't go into the house for a lot of different reasons. More liability and safety. So it's important for every city, every property to have a clean out so we can offer this service to the taxpayer. He still does not have one, Stephen. I would recommend that. So really have your recommendation. Yeah. So moving it forward in the future, you wouldn't have, you know, my friend. Oh, vendor Richie drain. Yeah. Before you say that too loud. Yeah. I would really recommend putting one in so we can help you. Because you have a very long run from where that property, where your property building ends through the roadway. It's that Dexter court is very tricky. So I really put one in so we can, so we can help you. Oh, you never know. Sewers is very tricky. We don't think about until we have a problem because it's underground. So, Mister Hamilton, so you do have the recommendation from the DPW what to do moving forward so that to protect yourself in the future. All right, so we already have a motion on the floor to approve this. Any further discussion for the entire amount of $1,870. Any further discussion? We good? Okay. Local. Yes. Yes.

Property damage. Now this is an instance where, if I'm reading correctly, that the fire department went to the house and they needed to access, according to, and I know the fire chief, Sia, the field inspection report. I'm sorry? The inspection. It was necessary for them to get in to make sure that there wasn't any type of emergency medical cell wellness type of situation. We've come across these types of scenarios before, correct? Last time we've had one, Bruce, research on it. There is the so called public necessity document, which property but sometimes have been safety, life safety issue. I'm a little bit unclear. Just, again, looking back at the statement, what was it that actually had you to that address? Was there a call. It was a medical call on the third floor. It was an interior door leading into the basement. And it was the type of situation that you really reasonably couldn't wait for somebody to come to grant you the access that you needed. Is that fair to say or. Yeah, well, they. It was getting the patient out. The way the stairway is configured, I see. Along with the door. They asked for access through the first floor, but nobody came to the door. And they were being carried out. Stair chair. And as they being carried out, they had to go in hallways. The basement door, e restaurant opened up. So they had to do one or the other. They go down the stairs or they had to go through the bed. And this was exterior. You had to get in. So, no, this was coming out. Okay. It was a interior door that was. Didn't plow and shouldn't that always just swing? Oh, yeah, that's. That's a little building code there thing going on. Okay. All right. Well, got it. All right. Because to me, you know, that's always got to swing out. Always swing out. All I can say is it doesn't sound like it was an alternative circumstances. It really comes down to what the committee thinks. I think you could use the public necessity doctrine. You could deny the claim or for some compensation. I'm not necessarily saying that, really, it's what the committee feels comfortable with, but I can tell you from a legal perspective, that would be the defense. Yeah, I. Yeah, I think, you know, when it's a matter of safety and, you know, they tried calling out, tried knocking, and tried to get somebody to open. They couldn't do it. And knowing at the door, you know, it's bringing in, not out, made it a little more difficult. So what say the committee? Do you have any to add up? So take a motion. What would you. What would be a motion that you would like to pose? I will post soon. Second. It's been moved by councillor, seconded by councilor Rubio, that we deny the property damage claim. Levando Garcia in two different amounts, 700 and then 1650 for property damage. Any further discussion? Yes. No further business. All favor. And so at this time, I do have some people that have joined us online, and if you're here to speak at public input and you joined us by the 635 deadline, could you please raise your hand as we move into the other room?

Circle follow. Councilor Moran here. Council coder here. Councillor Gregor. Two in attendance, if you want to read off number two. Yep. No one put public input, right? No. Nobody online or anything. Yeah. Okay. All right, go ahead. Okay. Item number two is an ordinance in amendment of article 23 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Pawtucket, 1996, entitled Public Art Fund. Motion made by Council Gutierrez, seconded by myself, that an ordinance. An amendment of article 23 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Kentucky 1996 entitled Public Art Fund certainly be filed and up for discussion. All right, Rob, you're here. Jennifer, you're here. I became chair of ordinance for this new term. I am not familiar with this, to be quite honest with you, because I wasn't part of the ordinance committee prior to this. So maybe you can just enlighten me and niecy as well, Councillor Kadir, as to where was left off with Frank and the audience committee at that point in time. Because, I mean, I have the audience in front of me. I don't know if there are changes already in here or there are going to be proposed changes, but just let me know what, you know, what's going on. Okay. So what we're doing with the public art fund is we're extracting out the public art piece of it. Okay. And just making about what. What the public art ordinance was for. And that was for the 1%. That was for public art from private contractors that are doing construction in the city. It takes out funding from city bond and band money and takes out the capital improvements for the city. So as we're looking at, like, I've got it in front of me. So that would be what was extracted from there would be, I guess it'd say the city construction project section. Correct. All right. And then, you know, wherever the lines are, basically, that's new. That is what's coming out. Coming out. Okay. And again, just, this would be everything that you see here that is stricken. And again, the rationale for that again, or for the whole point of that, like, why was it there, I guess, in the first place? And now it's being taken out. Just being taken out. Because usually when we do capital improvements from the city, it involves grants, cdBg, and that money can be used for. To be given back to the city to use for public art. And we're taking out public art from the public art fund, which are two different things. Public art would be under. In public spaces that public art is being handled. And this is actually for, again, the 1% that comes from contractors. All right. So this is kind of the tidy it up and stuff. Okay. Was that an issue before or anything? I was just curious why it was in there like that and begin with. Not to be thinking. I was just curious. I don't know how it was written that way. Okay. I was the audience chair when we. This came through. I think we did have a little bit of huffburn about some of the, like the requirement for the city construction project and things like that. But it went. It was suggested by the planning department of time that we do with this. So they're now pulling those things out. Required to spend public art on city construction projects. Correct? Correct. And then kind of cleaning up and putting it under planning and redevelopment under commerce. That is correct. It's moving from the planning department to the department of Commerce. The two major cleanups on the tire pin. Correct? Correct. All right. Anything else you wanted to add to that? Not at all. Do you have more questions? Any questions from you? Are you good? I understand that here. Okay. So again, just go over. Just explain it to me. The two main things. I know you just mentioned it. I'm just trying to get it in my head. It's going to be controlled by commerce and not planning, correct? That is correct. They're going to oversee it or make the decisions on it. And then the other thing was, what about the construction project the 1% is going to be based on? So not going to apply to city construction projects. Not apply to city construction. One of the rationales to that is that the HUD money that we do most of our constructions is not allowed to be used for that purpose. Right? Correct. Okay. Being educated. All right. Any other questions? No. All right, I'll take a motion to approve. I make a motion to approve the ordinance and amendment of article 23 of the Court of ordinances on your behalf. Motion made by Councilor Goodere, second and by myself. That approval be given to the audience and amendment of article 23 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Pawtucket, 1996 entitled Public Art Fund. Any discussion clerk or Colorado Chairman Moran? Yes. Councilor Kodak? Yes. Two to zero. No further business before the audience committee. The committee is adjourned. Thank you. You're welcome. Painless. Yes. So I see.

Excellent. Thank you. I'll make a note of it, and we will recognize you at that time. Thank you. Welcome to Tuckett City hall of Tucker City Council chambers. First on our agenda tonight is what we call pre council. It's an appointment of William Rogerio to the personnel board. We would have had William come up, but unfortunately he had a conflict and he's out of town tonight. We will be taking up his appointment later on, and I feel certain we will prove his appointments at the personnel board, but that was on our agenda, so I just wanted to address it. It is now 645, so we can begin with public input. We have two people in person and one person online. The first is Mister Michael Pompelli from Longley Court. Mister Pompelli, how are you? Got it. There you go. Thanks. Good evening. The financing update and item G on tonight's consent agenda by JK equities for their proposed main street truck terminal is extremely concerning. The letter dated March 13 states, we continue to work diligently to secure construction financing. As previously mentioned, interest rates continue to remain elevated, leaving the capital markets for new construction very challenged. Typical banks are still not in the market for construction financing for this asset type. Private debt funds are the only source of capital which we have found to be prohibitively expensive and uneconomical. Perhaps one reason banks are not financing these types of projects is because they're not currently needed. The project is designed to create jobs in our community, but there's currently a labor shortage with similar businesses struggling to fill positions. The ability to secure financing may be challenging and uneconomical for JK equities, but this project is also challenging and uneconomical for the city. It's challenging for the city. There are visual gateway via Main street. Once you pass the warming center, there's piles of debris surrounded by construction fencing. It's challenging for the city that the only appreciable green space in the Woodlawn neighborhood has been closed for years and is fenced off more securely than the adjacent piles of debris. It's uneconomical for the city that a parcel purchased for $3.3 million two and a half years ago gets a tax abatement. While the city's in a financial crisis requiring a special meeting of the school committee last night and a special council meeting next week, it's uneconomical for the city to be hiring consultants to conduct studies in support of a land and water conservation fund conversion application to Ryland Dem and National Park Service to build a new riverside park in Oak Hill to justify paving over Morley Field for parking since the development of the proposed truck terminal continues to be challenging and uneconomical, perhaps it would be beneficial for both JK equities and the City of Pawtucket to pivot on this project. Since we're experiencing a housing crisis, not an employment crisis, and since nearly every development featured on JK Equity's website, aside from the Pawtucket truck terminal, is residential, perhaps we could instead develop housing on the microfiber site without the additional parking on the Morley Field parcel and leave Morley Field alone. Or even better, use american rescue plan funds, if the city has any left, to buy the microfiber site and develop an expanded park at Morley Field extending all the way to Main street, providing a truly beautiful gateway to our city. On the subject of the LWCF conversion application, I learned from the city's response letter to Dem that 184 comment letters were submitted to the city opposing the Morley Field conversion and development of Riverside park. Of these, the Department of Planning and Redevelopment responded to portions of three of these letters with disagreement, and these three were included in a revised application submitted to DeM. The remaining 181 letters were not sent to demonstrate people submitted comments via Google form on the city's website in good faith. They were commenting to Dem, not to the city, and it's appalling that the city refused to share these comments with Dem. I'd request that if the council has any capacity to do so, to direct the city to submit all comments received to Dem for their review. Thank you. Thank you Mister Pompelli. Next, Mister Ford from 1210 Admiral street in Providence. Board good evening and again, thank you for the opportunity to speak. I just want to put something on the record. As a movie once said, we Houston, we have a problem here. In a letter addressed to Superintendent royal from the administration, specifically the chief financial officer of the city of Pawtucket, it's become clear that the city is in a cash strapped position that leaves them unable to meet its current commitments in terms of construction. And while no formal announcement has been made as to the cessation of constructio", "esg_v1": [{"name": "JK Equities", "insights": [{"observation": "The financing update for their proposed main street truck terminal is extremely concerning.

Next, Mister Ford from 1210 Admiral street in Providence. Board good evening and again, thank you for the opportunity to speak. I just want to put something on the record. As a movie once said, we Houston, we have a problem here. In a letter addressed to Superintendent royal from the administration, specifically the chief financial officer of the city of Pawtucket, it's become clear that the city is in a cash strapped position that leaves them unable to meet its current commitments in terms of construction. And while no formal announcement has been made as to the cessation of construction at Baldwin or any of the other smaller projects that are taking place, clearly this has ramifications for both Baldwin ongoing construction and maintenance, as well as projected expenses for the unified high school. So I just want to read this very briefly and hope you'll forgive me for this, but I want to put this into the public record. Dear Superintendent Royal, we have been made aware that the school department chief financial officer is no longer employed by the district. Given the current vacancy the city's finance department needs to bring to your attention several issues that would normally be overseen by the CFO that severely impact operations and will be further exacerbated if there is no continuity of financial operations. Mister Fox, can I just interrupt you for 1 second? Are you reading item g into the record? Probably, yeah. It's already on the record. It is not our agenda right now. Okay, then we're not going to read the entirety of a three page letter? Oh no, I was just going to read two lines, basically. Okay. All right, I'll wrap this part up quickly. I know that time is always of an issue. Let's just say this. Please be advised that absent any additional reimbursements for the approved school department projects or anticipated reimbursements from state and federal grants, we must put the school department on notice that as of April 15, 2024, we will no longer be able to make substantial contractor payments in order to reserve sufficient funds for normal operating expenses, including payroll. There was a meeting of the school department. I've got it online@coalitionradionetwork.com. dot ultimately, the signal that is sent to the community, to the teaching staff, is one that's terrorizing certain people, particularly given the recent breach of payroll this past November, which on a certain level, people are starting to question whether it's truly a clerical error. One of the school committee members brought up last night, as I've sort of beaten to death over the last few years of my appearances here, that the town, and I'm paraphrasing, but the city of Pawtucket has money to build a stadium, and yet at the same point in time, we're facing a fiscal cliff now with the construction of the Baldwin school. I went by the Baldwin school yesterday, and what's glaring is that neither the folks there were aware of this issue, nor was the governor when I questioned him this morning in person at an event in central falls. In addition to that, $3.2 million was sent by the state of Rhode Island, Rhode Island Department of Education. Part of the confusion from that missive to the public is that it's called housing, but it's not housing. That's how the Rhode Island Department of Education refers to the housing of students, that is, classrooms. The city has decided in all its wisdom to hold onto that $3.2 million and not transfer it via an accounting entry to the books of the school department, again citing the need to hold that for cash reserves. I've spoken to two attorneys, and of course you're not going to take my word, but that's fine. Who say pointedly that that is illegal so now you've got a situation where you've got these ongoing projects which there seems to be no public direction. Hopefully that'll happen tonight from the city council, but no public direction from the administration, and it's fully into the media. Myself last week, the channel twelve Sunday night, this needs to be addressed. Public confidence is shaken and the city's ability to meet its responsibilities and in some sectors infuriated by recent purchases of real estate to the tune of, I think it was about $14 million using APRA funds and $10 million capital injection into the stadium. Again, as one person pointed out last night's meeting, there seems to be a willingness to support pet projects. There doesn't seem to be a willingness to support school investments. And this follows a long train when the. You know, we've had a number of occasions over the last few years when the schools committee was asked to donate money from its capital reserve fund into operations budget with the city, and this past year, them having refused it, causing controversy and leading ultimately, some would say, for the mayor to create a city action committee to transfer the power of school committee appointments to an appointment from the mayor, as opposed to an election. So the petty politics and the chaos and the confusion that surround this and all bonding efforts needs to be cleared up. Finally, what appears to have happened, from my perspective, just doing my research documents I've requested, is that it appears that the winter school may have been paid for out of, well, cash flow. Cash flow generated by pay go payments, which essentially acts as quick reimbursements to the city. If in fact, we're paying for school construction out of cash flow, that's grotesque and belies every.

Thank you very much. Third is Mister Seamus Whedon, who is. Joins us online. Mister Whedon, good evening. We can hear you. Okay, great. Good evening. I just wanted to speak on. I got a notification that the harmony kennel dog Training LlC is. They've just moved into 65 Patterson Ave. Which is right behind my house, and they applied for a kennel license.

So I pretty much have everything lined up for security purposes. I understand there's always concerns for barking. My mentality is there should be no barking. We should all be in a peace, calm state of mind. There's an occasional bark here and there, but my door is always open for anybody to always come and ask me, hey, there's some issues, can we work on this? And there'd be no issues to work on it, but usually it's pretty quiet, like kind of. It's an art, keeping them nice and calm and relaxed, not chaotic. Mister Rosado, you're not looking to do overnight? Currently, no. Yeah, we're. It's going to take some build out. I'm very particular in just putting dogs in kennels. Anybody's always welcome to come by and take a look at the facility. And so right now we're currently just trying to get an operation. Doggy daycare, nothing. Staying overnight, day training, getting these dogs, just, again, just start an operation. The plan is to eventually open up a kennel side when that could be, we don't quite know. It's just going to take a lot of legwork. Talking to Dem and everything that comes along with Ken and getting a kennel license can take some time. So three, four, six months, who knows? Operating hours. Operating hours would be 07:00 a.m. to 07:00 p.m. we're going to be extending what currently I have. I've been operating from eight to six, but we want to kind of contour the second shift. People that can't quite have debt, daycare availability for people. And I find, as I've been in the industry for a very long time, a lot of people get out of work at like, five, six, got to pick up their kids. Rushing to go pick up their dogs can be really challenging. So being open a little bit later can be helpful for them, too. So that's the main purpose of just staying open a little bit later. I don't have any other questions, unless. Does anybody else in the board have any questions? Is it primarily inside? Yes, there is an outdoor area. Not exclusively. We do have an outdoor area. Potty break, little play area. Again, we're focusing more on training and not like a doggy day play area. Just red wild have added. Yeah, it's a very structured type of. Very structured type of training. Gotcha. Okay, this is a public hearing, so there are other folks who might want to weigh in. I know there's at least one online at once, so I'm going to have you, if you don't mind, just stand right there and maybe we'll have a question for you. Michelle, can we put or attach in Mister Whedon, please? Hello? Hi, mister Whedon. Okay, so this is the appropriate time for you to weigh in on this particular matter, so feel free to give us your opinion and ask. I'm sorry, I know it's Seamus Weedon. Address, please. 64 Vale Street. Gotcha. Okay. Thank you. Welcome. What's on your mind? So my concern is that I've moved into this neighborhood about a year ago, and it was, like, really quiet when we first moved here, which is with the exception of the highway being nearby, and it's continually gotten, the streets have gotten busier and busier. There's constant traffic going up and down the road and noise associated with that along with Mother Earth Wellness center. The recreational marijuana place just opened a drive through at the end of my street. So I'm situated right behind the building that the cattle license has been proposed at. My wife has worked with dogs her entire life, has worked at several of these building, mill building training kennels. The noise is impossible to mitigate. There's going to be barking. It's unrealistic to expect that there won't be barking. And I think it's going to disturb, it's going to be more noise in this neighborhood, and it's going to be disruptive to the families that live over here. So that's my main concern. Any additional traffic that that'll create. Well, mister weed, it seems like your concern extends to other ceramic businesses outside of Mister Rosado's kennels. Yeah, but I'm saying that'll be another contributing factor. I'm mostly concerned about the noise. That's. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. My understanding is that he's, he's agreed he would make himself available to, you know, any issues that you may have, see how, what, and if he can do anything about it. So, I mean, I'm of the opinion that he should at least be given a chance to see how he does. And if she issues do rise up, we can always take a look at it. At that time. Did you have something you want to say? I was just going to mention that if his wife is a professional, she's welcome to come and pick my brain on how I am going to control the sound and things like that. Again, my doors are always open. Feel free to pick my brain on how I'm going to control that and how I plan to keep dogs just nice and calm. It's an art. Unfortunately, it's not something a lot of people can do with the. With being able to prove it. We're allowed to open the doors to other facilities. Maybe potentially interested in wondering how I can keep the facility so quiet.

All in favor of approval for item two to consent to general correspondence? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries. I'm going to, with your indulgence, take Q and R first out of order and address them together. Item Q is a communication from the finance director from the city to Patricia Royal, the school superintendent, regarding critical school and city finances. And in response to that is a letter from me as city council president to the Commissioner of education, Angelica Infante Green, Mayor Grebian and Superintendent Royal, requesting their participation in a special council meeting I intend to call for next Wednesday. So just for a little bit of timeline on how this played out, the agenda for this meeting was completed and put together on in the afternoon of Thursday last week. Late that day and into the next morning, I was notified that we had the, the administration wanted to add an agenda item, which is item q, I allowed that to go on, and once I read that letter, which is very alarming and included in it kind of a quick deadline for building of the school's budget to get it baked into the city's budget and get approval in time for what we have to do of April 17, and we wouldn't be meeting again until April 10. And I just felt that if we didn't do something to pull these two parties together and try to come to some sort of a cooperative approach to handling this, we would just be burying our heads in the sand. You know, it's not too frequently we get involved in these things, but the importance and the tone of the letter, I think, left us no choice. So I hope you agree that holding a meeting on next Wednesday, and I will say that all three of the individuals I sent the letter to, Superintendent Royal, responded within. Within the hour, probably within a half hour, saying she would be happily attend. The mayor told me he would attend, and I heard yes yesterday from the commissioner's office. Although she herself cannot attend, she will be sending the appropriate representatives from ride to help us get through this. So I appreciate all three parties agreeing. Having said that, I also put in the letter. You have it in front of you. I actually gave each of you a signed copy today, but it hasn't changed. Other than the signature, it indicates that I was. I hope to have the clerk's office approach each of those three tomorrow with a better understanding of what it is we're looking to get addressed next Wednesday. So in order to do that, I actually asked that the city's finance director appear tonight so he could expand on his letter. And there are a couple things that I'd like to know a little bit more about so I can inform the participants for the next week of what it is we're trying to get to the bottom. So I know the director is here. You could come forward, please. You don't have to state your name and. Sure. Good evening. How is everybody? Good evening. Evening. I guess since we all have a tough time with it, why don't you. It's on. Why don't you state your name first? Director Mark Stankiewicz. But everyone should just call me Mark. It's much easier. And with. With you is Ryan Holt from the mayor's office. Right. Thank you. Yes. Thank you, mister President. Nice to be here. Thank you. How would you like to proceed? Let me toss it to you in just 1 second. Okay. Okay. And then you can kind of flesh out what's in the lemon. I think you'd agree with us that it's a bit of an alarming letter. I think we're probably meant to get attention. Yes, I can back it up a little bit. As you know, I'm not a long term employee. I've been here almost a year now. And also on the school side, this CFO left in July of last year, and then there was a replacement. And unfortunately for the school, there was a number, significant number of school personnel on the financial side that left during that period, which left them fairly well strapped. Now, during that time period, we have been working with the CFO on a number of issues because it was a learning process for him, learning process for me. We're working it along. We had conversations, we had emails, we had. Towards the end, we were actually meeting once a week with each other to go over particular items. And then in March, unbeknownst to us, the CFO was no longer employed at the school district. And unfortunately, we weren't aware of it. We heard from it basically third hand. And with that, there was no direction as to who. The financial team on the city side is supposed to work with the schools on some significant issues. And some of the main, and I just put the main ones down there is, we have an audit that needs. That's late that we agreed would be completed by March 31. And we need someone in charge in order to happen. Sure. Okay. On the audit, in a meeting I was at a month and a half, two months ago, when we were told that we got the extension to March 31.

That was a hard one time only extension to March 31. No, no. If, ands or buts, correct? That's my understanding. And from, from the order. And we got that because the city, the schools had not closed fiscal 23, is that correct? Essentially, yes. And is fiscal 23 on the school side closed? My understanding is it is, all the paperwork is up with the auditor. But even with that, when the audit is being finalized, there's footnotes, there's other additions, there may be questions, some last minute things that need to be prepared or answered or clarified in order to have the audit finance finalized with our audit group. And there needs to be someone on the city side and on the school side to be available and to respond, and be able to respond intelligently if those questions arise. Is there somebody designated on the school. I know that's part of what you put on it. Is there somebody designated to answer the auditor's questions relative to school finance? Not to my knowledge. Okay. No one has been put forward to me as to this. Is the person in response to this letter, correct? Right. Have you had a conversation with anybody in the school site since this letter was sent out last Thursday night? Just email transactions with the superintendent, and I've had conversations with the auditor general and with some representatives of the Rhode island department of Education. And do our auditors feel that we will meet the deadline? We're optimistic, but, you know, nothing's 100%. We're optimistic that it's going to happen, but it's, as you can imagine, it's very important for that to happen to be concluded, and we have a final audit done for the city. Okay. Didn't mean to interrupt, but I. I wanted to go chronologically with your. With your letter, so that takes care of that. Right. Then. The next issue, of course, was the budget. And I was not sure whether anyone over at the school side besides the CFO was aware of the particular timelines for the school to put together their budget, to get it to the council, so we could combine it, get it up to the state, get it approved, because if we missed that timeline, then we're not able to set a budget, have the tax rate approved, and then get the bills out on time. And if we don't get the bills out on time, that means there's another delay in revenues coming into the city. And if I could just expand just for a moment as to how this all works. The budget, the expenditures, and the revenues are estimates. They're our guide plan throughout the course of the year. Many folks believe that they feel that at July 1, the armored truck dumps the entire years with a budget on the city steps. And we just take from that pile. No, it comes in, in the form of tax revenues, state grants, federal grants. There are timing issues to all these things. So it's very important that we have our tax bills out on time, that we send out reimbursements on time, that the revenues that we had anticipated come in, do come in, and they come in in a timely manner, because if we miss a June 30 deadline, falls into another fiscal year, so on and so forth. So part of that, what we're talking about, is that we want to make sure that on whatever basis they're applying for the grants, the ESRI funds. There are some big grants on the school side as you grants is the capital grants that those are being monitored, they're being applied for on a regular basis. And the reimbursements will come in for this year. We definitely need the reimbursements to come in before June 30 or else they can't be applied to this fiscal year, in this fiscal budget. Correct? Correct. Okay. Actually, I want to. I intended to start by saying that tonight and next Wednesday's meeting is not a witch hunt. It's not about pointing fingers, it's not about assigning blame. I just thought if we did not try to join this effort and try to work out some collaboration, it sounds to me like there's a lack of historical and institutional knowledge on the school side. Correct. There's a disconnect on who should be communicating with whom. And again, I'm not assigning Blaine, but you know, we were here two meetings ago and we made a point of saying we don't want to get involved in petty politics and animosity and animus among folks. And that's not the intent of tonight, it's not the intent of next Wednesday. I think the intent is to get to the bottom of some of the alarming things we put in and craft a pathway forward. Schools, city side, us, if we can help, and informed in large part by the commissioner's office. So that I just want to make that clear, this is not a witch hunter or a blame assigning thing. So, Mister President, may I just add to your comments there, because you're right on point. The letter that was sent out by the administration was not an effort to be a witch hunter or anything like that. It's. We saw a problem developing.

And again, I'm not assigning Blaine, but you know, we were here two meetings ago and we made a point of saying we don't want to get involved in petty politics and animosity and animus among folks. And that's not the intent of tonight, it's not the intent of next Wednesday. I think the intent is to get to the bottom of some of the alarming things we put in and craft a pathway forward. Schools, city side, us, if we can help, and informed in large part by the commissioner's office. So that I just want to make that clear, this is not a witch hunter or a blame assigning thing. So, Mister President, may I just add to your comments there, because you're right on point. The letter that was sent out by the administration was not an effort to be a witch hunter or anything like that. It's. We saw a problem developing. We wanted to get the parties to the table to come together and figure out a solution to that problem before it became an actual major problem for the city. So this is an effort at collaboration, solving a problem and working together to get it done, to serve the people that we want to serve. Right. We all want to serve the. The residents of the city, the taxpayers, the students, the teachers, and just get things done. So we agree with you wholeheartedly, Mister president. This is not a witch hunt, a blame game. It's just a way to get the parties to the table, figure this thing out and get done. Okay, so mark, I'm going to try to move this along just a little bit and then some other counselors may have some questions and I could back up a little bit. We do have a meeting scheduled next week, so if there are, you know, you come up with particular questions or you need some information, feel free to send them to the chief of staff between now and then. We'll do our best to answer the no, to have the information available at that meeting. If you desire something. Okay. Thank you. And that's much, that's much appreciated. So a couple of things I had, and again, I don't want to litigate this all tonight. I just want us to be able to wrap our minds around what it is we would like to see next week. So a couple things that struck me. We've already talked about the budget and the audit. There were a couple mentions in here about concerns about not. So I know we have a bonding disconnect of how it works. The voters passed a bond. That doesn't mean that's the end. The end of the work. That's the beginning of the work. That's correct. We cannot know. Should we not bond the entire amount of a project on the first day? We bond it in phases as construction goes on. You need to know in phases or along some sort of a planned timeline. We'll need x amount in bond dollars over this period of time. And then I assume that is informed by what do they call the colliers, their construct project manager, their OPM and somebody. And again, we fully understand that they are decimated in their financing finance department. So. But is it generally speaking, for the last hundred years, or at least the last number of years we'll be doing school construction? Is it a collaborative effort that schools inform the city side when and how much they need to bond or at least approach the process, at least in the near term. And we have staff here that have been here 30 years, is typically the project manager. Their OPM puts together what's been expended, what they anticipate to be expended, usually at least on a fiscal year basis, they gather those figures up together. The OPM and the schools normally fill in the numbers in the paperwork on the request form. The request form then comes to the city. We review it, we sign it, and then it goes off to the state for reimbursements. Well, I'll back that up for the bond. We would go out to bond and this in the same process would typically go for the reimbursement. Once the funds are expended, then similar paperwork is prepared and then sent up for the state. So we get the reimbursements on our bonds. As far as the city is concerned, we don't have the knowledge, we don't have the wherewithal of where they are in their construction projects, what they expect to be doing into the next year. That's really a function of their OPM, help their project manager to provide that information. And that's critical for us to either go out to bond and also for our reimbursements. And has that happened recently on either the Boulder project or. It has not happened. The last bond that went out was, I believe, in the spring of 2013. 3rd 23 22. Thank you. The spring of 22. So 22 was the last time that has happened. So how long is it generally between when you have those types of conversations? Like if it's spring of 22, I would assume there's some sort of conversation between then and spring of 23, let's say, because they're long time. And again, I don't want to get too far, too far afield. So historically, the relationship between the finance director of the city and the CFO of the schools was good. And my understanding is that they usually met it quarterly, at least a couple times a year or quarterly to go over those things, see where they are, see if they're in need of a bond. How big of a bond is it going to be, a bonding disparity node? Is it going to be, you know, a full bond? Are they going to be guide combined with something else? And there's a lot of other factors. What's the interest rate? What's the market? We have financial advisors, we have project managers. We have all sorts of professionals to advise us as to what is the best way to go about it in the right timing. Okay, so the fact that it hasn't been a bond floated since 22 doesn't suggest any problems. It just, the communication was still ongoing. Just, there was no need to actually float a bond at that time. And now, since the departure of the longstanding CFO and not long after departure of our longstanding CFO, is it safe to say that communication, that lead time, that timeline has kind of fall", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "The letter sent out by the administration was not an effort to point fingers but to address a developing problem early.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project management and bonding process includes reviews and approvals by city officials, and information is necessary from the schools' OPM to proceed.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There has been a lack of recent communication and bonding for school projects.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Historically, the finance director of the city and the CFO of the schools met quarterly to discuss bonds.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Since the departure of key financial officers, communication regarding school project funding has declined.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "The letter sent out by the administration was not an effort to point fingers but to address a developing problem early.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project management and bonding process includes reviews and approvals by city officials, and information is necessary from the schools' OPM to proceed.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There has been a lack of recent communication and bonding for school projects.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Historically, the finance director of the city and the CFO of the schools met quarterly to discuss bonds.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Since the departure of key financial officers, communication regarding school project funding has declined.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 4487810, "chunk_end_time": 4917432, "base_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240320&iCurrentPosition=3703", "chunk_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240320&iCurrentPosition=4487"}, {"start": 49000, "end": 55000, "text": "chools was good.

It has. And the familiarity of the people, the trust that was built up over the number of years, how they operate. It's when you work with someone for a length of time, you do get into a rhythm. You kind of understand where the markers are, what needs to be done at particular points in times. And when there's a break, it's a learning curve in order to pick that up again. All right, thank you. And again, my last kind of question about what it is, I want to find out for next week, and then I'll open it up to anybody else? But most recent projections show that without receiving significant reimbursements from the school department, construction projects, reimbursements for educational grants or issue a long term borrow. That's something we would do, not something they would do. But is there a delay, is there a disconnect between seeking reimbursement for construction projects and what is it you mean about reimbursements to educational grants? Can you just tell me what you mean for educational grants? The big one I would point out to her is the essay funds. SR fund. SR fund. That's our funds from the school. Those are millions and millions of dollars. And they. And typically the school department has sent out reimbursements on a quarterly basis. Now, I don't have. Not in charge of their books. I don't, I don't, you know, look at those particular schedules. They don't. It's not reported to me. But best we can figure out, for the fiscal year 2024, no reimbursements have been sent out for that particular grant fund so far. Okay. That's the best of my knowledge. But those are significant numbers of dollars that, of course, come in and we have a pooled cash between the city and the schools that helps bring in funds. So that way we can pay the payrolls, we can pay the vendors, we can do the things that we do on a regular basis. Any other federal grants? There are, but I don't know them off the top of my head. There's one other large one, if you give me an idea which stands for title one. Title one funding. Yes. So we haven't requested from the federal government. We don't. I don't mean we don't do the request. That's where the disconnect is. We don't know whether or not the school department has requested reimbursement from the us government for title one funding that is baked into our budget. Yeah. We believe that that has not happened yet. Okay. To the best of our knowledge, for the resources that we have. Last question for me. Do we believe this is a fixable situation? I personally do. That was the whole reason of the letter. Once the CFO left, we had to bring attention to this particular issue because it's an underlying issue of the continuity of the financial process, both for the state and for the schools. You have to have some continuity to make sure that things don't fall through the crack, especially the big things. And I mentioned big things. Audits, budgets, reimbursements, those are all crucial things that folks have to pay attention to. And it is vitally important that we get folks in place that are able to conduct that business. So that way we don't skip a beat. Will we make it through the end of the year? I have every confidence that we will, but we'll need to work together with the school department, you know, with the state to make sure that it's done properly. And since we've had the disconnect, there are, you know, we will be, you know, more. More communications with the Rhode Island Department of Education, which normally the city of itself doesn't have that many communications, but we will have to develop that system. And I think the meeting, you know, that we're going to have is trying to lay the groundwork for that. Do you mean the meeting we're having or do you have another meeting with the school side? We do, we do. We do have one that we have. We have scheduled an internal, and also the one so that the city council and the school committee can understand, you know. You know, and I'll just. I don't want to be picky on, but, you know, I've heard it so. Well, the city submits the reimbursement. Well, technically, yes, but the knowledge, the paperwork, the cash flow chart, all that is generated by the. By the OPM, the project manager with the school department be filled out. Yes. For then for us to sign, to send in. I just can't put a number on a document instead of in for a reimbursement. It's got to have backup. It's got to have backup justification. Gotcha. Okay, thank you. Last thing for me, Mister Holt. Will you just do me a favor? Yes, sir. I don't really have any authority in this manner, but could we just reiterate to the school department that the first two things that the request in the last sentence of each paragraph to assign someone, can we see if they have, or if they have someone they think they can assign to answering any questions, if the auditors have them. And paragraph two, anybody who can get the ball rolling on them budget.

So we've got probably ten business days, twelve business days to get that budget put together. So if you could just reiterate that ask. I know you don't have any authority to tell them what to do, but I'm happy to make that ask. And can I just add one thing? Your question about this being a fixable problem. I agree with. With our finance director, and that's exactly why this letter was sent when it was sent. Because we knew this was a. You know, you can see something coming. And rather than waiting for it to get to a point where it's not a fixable thing, this is fixable if everybody comes together, and I am very confident, as is the director, that folks are going to come together with the right spirit here and the right, you know, the right shared goal of getting this done. Okay. Thank you. So that's it for me. I know I keep saying that's it for me, but council wilderness, you have your finger up. Yeah. Thank you, council president. I wasn't going to speak on this until you mentioned this meeting. And it's just an observation, I think two months ago, the mayor put us all in a room together. The chairman of the school committee, the deputy chair, the council and the administration. And I know the mayor let off the meeting and made it sound like it was a Kumbaya meeting and asked to say that we bury the hatchet and get things done. I know some people aren't happy with me when it comes to funding and all that. I really don't care. But what I do care about is the concept of knowing what we're doing. And I think one of the points that have been sticking around in my head now is, is that our constituents elect us, school committee and city council, to resolve issues, not turn around and create them. And for that reason, I think, again, it's been mentioned by Mister Holt and yourself and your letter. And even Mark has indicated that we need now to collaborate on fixing this problem, not turn around, sitting here worrying about it to the point where it's going to become a disaster. Let's fix it before it becomes that disaster. So that's what should be the charge for all of us to turn around and say, because I've got severe reservations when it comes to funding in a school department that is, from my estimation, is dysfunctional sometimes, but that's neither here nor there. I'm told sometimes when we try to interject our opinion and our concerns that we should mind our business and stay in our own lane. Well, this is all our business and we should all get in the same lane to make sure that we get it resolved. Thank you. Thank you. Casas. To go yet? I actually just want to echo that, because I did get a few messages about this last night as the school committee meeting was going on. And I said, well, I'll learn more tomorrow. And I know we have a special meeting coming up, but I think what council will saying is so true, because right now we have the perspective of one representing body and our constituents have a tense narrative being thrown at them right now. So I think if all of us, all the representing bodies get on the same page, I think that will really help quell some of the feelings that I think are out and about in the community right now. And our job is to solve that. So, thank you, council president. I'm glad that you already thought I had to schedule this meeting, because I think this is very important. There's a lot of people concerned about it. Now, I did happen to attend the school committee meeting, and, I mean, I left it sort of confused because they completely refuted a lot of the assertions in your letter and large part regarding who was responsible for the money. And everyone there, from the chairman to various members and the school of superintendent, all said that all the paperwork or whatever they had needed to be submitted for not only the audit that's coming up, but also for the bonds to be issued have been submitted. And the city is the one that's not acting up, that's not acting our bills. So these are contrary statements being going around. I don't think everybody said here. I don't think sitting here placing blame on the school committee that helps anybody right now, because I think it does need to be resolved. But these are concerns. And one of the questions I do have, because that was brought up is how was winter and Baldwin construction funded? Where did these funds come from? Because it's being suggested alternative funds outside of bonds that were issued were used for that. Because especially with Baldwin, I mean, it's already been delayed for a year, and I'm not sure how this is going to hold up the community over there and families and how it's going to affect the children over there with what's going on here.

And we will have, the administration will be here, the state will be here, and folks from the school department will be here. So they can answer that question for you next week. But I will not speak for them. Just know that there's a lot of false information out there. That's just, that's what happens in these situations. No, no, I disagree. We are not putting out any false information, counselor. And I take issue with that, with that sentiment. Well, maybe not false, but no, they're varying. They're varying statements. Varying, sure. But I take issue with you calling it false. You use the word false. I was just reading. Their information is false, not ours. Well, see, well, this is the sort of thing I'm trying to avoid, is place. What we'll have next about, you know, suggesting statements that they're making is false, is putting oil in the fire. So I'm not sure how that's going to be useful. Did you suggest that the council of the school committee was making false statements or this is this, there's false information out in the universe, misses misinformation. Yes. Better, yes. Yes. Maybe. Yes. And that's what we're doing here. We're trying to clear everything up, get everybody work together. And that's what the point of the letter is. And that's what the point of next week's meeting is. Okay. Anybody on this side? No. First of all, I want to thank you, Mark, for coming and Ryan as well. And again, next Wednesday, we'll have a special meeting with hopefully ride and yourselves and representatives from the school department. I kind of call it a fact finding meeting so that we can maybe really get down to the brass facts of what's really going on. Because again, I know we don't want to cast stones and cast aspersions on certain people, but I think one thing, my angle as I look at this is I look at it as a prevention thing and it's more on the school side. I mean, I think we can all maybe somewhat agree that there is an issue on the school end of it in their finance department, which in my opinion is the most important department. You've got to make sure that that's shored up and that's stabilized. I mean, that's what pays the bills, that's what pays the bonds. I mean, that's what keeps things going for the school department as well as the city side, too. So the fact that that's, quote unquote, decimated, I mean, personally, like, how long has that been going on? How long has that department been decimated? I mean, back in the day when Melissa Devine was there, I mean, and she was the CFO, there were no issues. She got along with our finance director and everything went along well, like you said, continuity. So there is no continuity. So that, I mean, I don't have any confidence on that other side right now until someone tells me. And hopefully the whole counsel and the administration that that department is stabilized. I mean, I mean, hopefully they'll get a CFO that's not going to leave after so many months. I mean, that is just so important. So until I see that, I'm not comfortable at all. And so I, hopefully we get to the bottom of it next Wednesday. And as the president alluded to earlier, the timelines are very, very tight and it's like a trickle down effect, as we all know. If for some reason there's an issue on the school side, if that was established and that can't be fixed or patched up, that's going to trickle down to our side of the budget as well, and that'll affect the taxpayers and maybe increase taxes. So we've got so many deadlines that are coming up that I'm very fearful of that whole situation. You could almost consider it as being a crisis of financial crisis situation. But maybe we're not there right now because again, we have to get more facts. And like you said, Mark, that maybe everything will all be good and well once we get to that point in the next week or two. But I mean, it's crunch time right now, and I'm really, really, really nervous about what's going on. And again, we don't have a lot of say in the matter, but I do want to at least thank the president for calling that meeting for next week. I think it's important. We can't really do a heck of a lot, but at least we need to know what's really going on. Maybe we can all be on the same page, as Councillor Koviak said. I mean, that's the key. Get on the same page, but also get your physical house in order on the other side. If that's an issue, again, if that's decimated again, that's the most important department. I mean, if you weren't there, we didn't have anybody there. I know we'd have somebody covering. We all know that. But still, we have confidence in that. But there may be no confidence on that other side, on the school side to handle any type of financial issue going forward. So that's kind of scary news to me. So thank you, Councilor Rugio. Yeah, I just want to thank the president for that proactive approach to have a meeting next week and to get", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Baldwin Construction", "insights": [{"observation": "Baldwin construction has been delayed for a year, and current work is halted which affects the community and families.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Winter Construction", "insights": [{"observation": "Questions regarding the funding of Winter construction and concerns about the use of alternative funds outside of issued bonds.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Baldwin Construction", "insights": [{"observation": "Baldwin construction has been delayed for a year, and current work is halted which affects the community and families.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}, {"name": "Winter Construction", "insights": [{"observation": "Questions regarding the funding of Winter construction and concerns about the use of alternative funds outside of issued bonds.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 5525084, "chunk_end_time": 5848842, "base_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240320&iCurrentPosition=3703", "chunk_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240320&iCurrentPosition=5525"}, {"start": 64000, "end": 70000, "text": "ly nervous about what's going on.

Yeah, I just want to thank the president for that proactive approach to have a meeting next week and to get everybody together and collaborate and try to figure this out. We, you know, we don't have a lot of say over what they do with the finances, but it's really scary that, you know, if their title one funding is in jeopardy, that's millions of dollars that's taken away from our children, it's taken away from our educators. It's taken away from the overall education that they're receiving in the city and in the ESSA funding as well. So it's a proactive approach, in my opinion. Having this meeting, it is not about name calling or pointing fingers. We got to elect to do a job. We're going to do our part on this council by having this meeting about taking in it, and let's see if we can, you know, figure out what the problems are. Let's get this era right. Councilman, man, this is crunch time. We need to definitely take care of these issues. We got to get together and work together on this because residents deserve that, our kids deserve that, our educators deserve that. And we represent the city on the city side. Let's, we'll work with them. Let's see if we can figure this out in, you know, you can't lose, you know, asset funding and title I funding. It's just so much money, it'll be a detriment to the school district. Thank you. One last thing. When the term misinformation came up, so I think sometime late on what is today, Wednesday, late on Monday, you sent an email to the superintendent in response to an email she had sent you regarding roughly $3.2 million. Right. That I have since asked you for a copy of that. But who did that originally? Go to your email on Monday night? That email was in response to the superintendent's email directing $3.2 million of funds into a capital reserve. Capital reserve. Right. And that was, well, when we get, when we monitor the state of fundings that happen, I know it's hard to see, but it's a ripe a, and it's a one liner. And in there it says Department of Revenue, and it's for housing aid. Now, housing aid is a pretty broad category. And given the inability to really speak to somebody over at the school side as to how this is broken up, we now have to go to Ryan. And so subsequent to that email going out, I did have conversation with Ryan. They did send down confirmation as to where the funds should go. And again, going forward, I think that needs to be part of the process is that the city side should be included on these correspondents as well, and especially if the department of Revenue is saying, oh, this fund should go here, this fund should go here. But when we get the notice, it's like housing funds, and we know it goes more than one line item. And generally speaking, I recall having this conversation with the previous finance director two years ago. I don't know why it stuck in my head. But we get housing money that's categorized as housing into the city side. That is correct. I see the assistant director shaking her head. We get it generally in March. Is that right? Correct. That was assumption. So when you saw 3.2 categorized in some way as housing and the superintendent brought it up to you thinking it was x and you thought it was y, is that right? You have since determined that a good portion of it was indeed x is intended to go into the capital reserve fund of the school committee, right. According to department. According to the Rhode Island Department of Education. But also Rhode Island Department of Education says, oh, there's another chunk of money that's coming in in April, and that's. We believe that's the money that we were talking about, housing aid. Roughly something million. I think it's in neighborhood around 4 million. Okay, but don't hold me to that number till the. But you, you cleared up as of late yesterday with ride that it was. Yes. That your initial perception. So I guess my question is this. Yes. And we did. And we did notify the superintendent and the email chain that went along with it that, yes, we confirmed it with ride. That's where it's going to go. But the original email from Monday night to the superintendent saying essentially, no, no, this is this housing money, not this house. Who did that go to? Where did you send that email again? I don't have it in front of me, but it was sent to the superintendent. And whoever she had copied that all that money was, was going. She wanted it, put it into the capital reserve. And that was dinner time on Monday. And by, by breakfast time on Tuesday, it was all over the place with the suggestion that the city was stealing money intended for construction. Is that right? I'm just wondering how within, from dinner to breakfast, it was out there. And the misinformation about stealing, which then informed the misinformation at last night's school committee. I'm just wondering how that happened. Well, it wasn't you. It happened in that we're very cautious now, so we want to make sure that where the funds come in, go into the right place.

And we are going to go to ride just to make sure everything is done right. Okay. And we. And we on the city side should be expecting somewhere between 3.5 and $4 million to come in housing designated money that we always get. And we always use for the purposes. Traditionally we get that every year. That's correct. All right, thank you very much. Sorry to keep you here late. One more question. Yeah, yeah. So again, just as a parameter, I just wanted to get a sense in terms of the funding for winter school and Baldwin. Where would those funds come from? Well, the city and the school is one organization. So what we have done, for example, on the city side, we have a spending freeze. We're only hiring essential personnel. So we're trying to, you know, generate some cash to keep not only projects and things like that, but other operational things going. So essentially what we've done is we've. We've taken money from other accounts to pay bills, and the school projects are some of those bills that we've been paying. So they weren't paid as a result of bonds that were issued. Just. I just want to be clear on that. Not recent. The last bond that went out was, again, as we said, in 2022. But the bills. But the bills come in and as long as they're proper bills, we have an obligation to pay them. Would you mind if I ask the assistant director a quick question? Will the assistant director mind if I ask a question? Just. You can even stay right there. She can't be hurt. Okay. If you would come up, please, and I'm sorry. Sorry, Judy, winter school was somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 or $60 million, right? Correct. Do we have 50 or $60 million around to pay as we go? I don't know what they have from our cash flow. I'm saying it's been suggested that the city didn't bond for the construction of winter school, did we? Indeed. We bonded for winters and Baldwin when we did the bond in 2022. But winters was not paid for $60 million out of your pocket daily. Right. It was a bond to pay for that construction and also carrying bond cost, interest costs. Yeah. It was paid part for winters and then we had went ahead to get some for Baldwin. Right. We weren't paying. We didn't build winters with piggy bank money, right? No. Out of the general operating fund. No. I believe they used Paygo money. Yes. Okay. That's all I wanted to know. Thank you. Just one last thing. Now, we have a strict deadline, I think. Was it March 31 for the audit? Yeah, for the audit. So, I mean, the fact, like I said, is that the fact that the audit was due in December of last year wasn't done. That should have been signal enough to initiate this process earlier. But I've been waiting on the month in which you have a strict deadline to get this done. So these are the sole concerns. We got the extension because it wasn't being done because they had not. They didn't have the financial staffing to close their fiscal 23 budget. So that's entirely on them from the close of fiscal 23 to February or march to close their books. Our books were closed when? On fiscal 23, give or take. When was our. Our fiscal books closed on 23? Well, we had. Okay, and the. And in our city's defense, and the school's defense, we were cognizant that there were staffing issues over at the school department, working with the CFO, you know, getting assurances that they were working diligently to get that paperwork done. The city is the one that went out and approached the auditor general for the extension, for their sake and for ours as well. And we had two meetings with the auditor general, and it was agreed upon for March 31 deadline. And that was done into consideration because the auditor general knew that there were staffing issues at the school and wanted to give them adequate time to get everything together. So it was. Was a cooperative kind of effort. Thank you, director. It was entirely. The school of the prevented the audit from happening in December. That was. That was our hold up. Yes. And that's indisputable. We had a meeting on that, so that's indisputable. Thank you. All right, so thank you both. Rick, if you might just take a pen and pencil for a second. I had told the commissioner, the superintendent, and the mayor that we'd get back to them tomorrow morning with some of the things that we were hoping to get to the bottom of. I'll go and tick off a few, and then the rest of councilors tell me if I've missed something or there's something else you'd like to address. So, we'd like to talk about the school construction reimbursement process and where we are. Educational funding reimbursement. And that. Don't go too fast. Sorry. Google construction reimbursement process. The bonding process. We might as well, you know, the step by step bonding process. I don't think you get the educational. Educational funding reimbursement.

And that at least two of the categories is Esser money, which is the school's version of ARPA, and title one, which is federal grant money for educational purposes. The capital reserve balances. And where that stands. Yes. Although that wasn't in this letter. But let's, uh. The capital reserve balance, I think, should, on paper anyway, be somewhat healthier. With that 3.0 something million director. You're talking about the school capital? Yes. Yeah. If I may, the school capital fund is a function of the school and their accounting department. And how they. Our. How they're calculating the funds that's. They have financial authority. The school does between. Yeah, we're not asking you all. Yeah. We're saying the questions. We can't. We can't get there. Yeah. Hopefully we'll know and hopefully they. Hopefully they'll be able to bring down. Somebody's gonna answer that. So I, you know, maybe I misstated or you misinterpreted, but these questions, these topics are going to go to the commissioner of the mayor and the superintendent, so that all three can give us a clearer picture on everything. So, yes, the capital reserve account, because that certainly will come up, come into play. And Councilor William and Mark also mentioned grant money. Could we get up to date on whether they've applied for certain grant money? I think the Esser grant. Yeah, you had mentioned that, right? Yeah. Did you already mention. I apologize, Esther. Is there Arpa? Title one is federal grant funding for education? I was. I just understood that grant money. He said another thing was that grant money was applied for by the school department. So I just want to know if any of that grant money that. To necessitate for us to get the reimbursement for or to come back to the city for, whether it was applied for or not. And along, along those lines, there's one other thing I'd like to add. As far as grant money, I know the city's been very successful in the last handful of years with what they call community schools, and those are funded with grant money. Can we just find out where we stand on community school grant funding for school year 24, 25, please. Do you have anything, councillor? No, you hit it when Councillor Wilhelm hit it, too. I want to. My concern is to see where we stand with, you know, those fund title one funds and what have you. If they've been applied for, if we still have time to apply for them, they'll be able to hopefully answer those questions, because, again, that's millions of dollars that we need. They need justice to Goliad. Just a quick question. Is this going into executive or it remains public? No, I don't. I don't know. I didn't research it, but I don't know that there's. I could talk to the solicitor to see if there are certain aspects of this that might be better addressed in executive session. We'll figure that out by the time we put the agenda together on Thursday night or Friday morning, I guess we could probably put that agenda together. Rick is as late as next Monday, correct? Yes. Okay. And that we might have to do that. You have one more thing. Well, no, I just want to say, I don't know whether that's a good idea in light of the fact that there's a lot of misinformation going on and people are nervous. If we do need to protect certain things, then we might have to. I will take that under advisement and ask the solicitor for his opinion, and, you know, he may even consult with the school committee's attorney. So I think that kind of does it. Rick and Mister Holt, last thing, I'll let you guys go, but last thing, you were going to. Again, with no authority to do so, just touch base and remind them that it's in everybody's best interest that they assign somebody to the audit and somebody to the budget. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, you know, if you can. One thing, I think it's where do they stand with hiring a new CFO? Yes. All right. Could we mention that? Because that's so critical. Have they started the process? Have they started the search? Or, you know, because again, that collaboration that the former CFO of both the school department and the city, the finance director, they work very well together. And so, you know, Mark needs somebody to be able to work with over there, too. This is probably a question for next week, but do you have the wherewithal or what? What are they calling on the bandwidth to do a little bit of work over there for them? I see. I see you shaking your head no. Deputy director. Okay. A lot of different laws. We'll ask it again next week. Did you have one last question? Oh, I was just going to say, when. When councillor Rougeau said the CFO, I was, to councilor Moran's point, maybe just the health of that department in general, in addition to the CFO, because it sounds like that whole department is.

And Rick, I would just ask one last thing in that correspondence, reiterate that at the outset of this, this was simply about getting everyone together in the same room to address a number of alarming shortcomings and carve the best path cooperatively with those three in this body to fix things. Okay. Just so they. They may not have watched tonight, they may not see anything about it, but that. That's kind of the biggest takeaway from this. So if you would, please, uh, all in favor of sending that communication? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries. Okay, um, we are now on to what's three? Uh, no. Oh, we're still doing the items. Yes, we still. We're still doing a consent agenda. F. You gotta go to f and Councilor Gregor, do you. Okay, I know f is different, but do you. And then I want to take Gene and H together. Yeah. So I'll just like to speak on g. You had said f. Yeah. Separate. Yeah, that one's separate. And then. But G and H together or not? Yeah, g and H together. Okay. All right, you have the floor. Okay, so g is a communication from John Colic, Blackstone Distribution center, LLC, to the armored members of Tucker City council. Response to the one most of 120 24 construction update. And with that, h is ray. That it's communication from Bianca Polycastro, planning director, to the Terrence Mercer, council president. This is in response to maintenance plan for one of the Shasta budding property. So, I mean, as I stated, I appreciate the responses from both to those, JK as well as from the director. However, I'm a little puzzled that JK letters is suggesting that since the last update, they have hired a local third party property manager to conduct weekly site visits, inspect the property, and clean up loose thrash along the perimeter. And they get a monthly report. Let's see. And related with that is, they say they in constant communication with the planning department, as well as the zoning and code enforcement to immediate issues they arise, and they have regular phone conferences on top of that. So if that is in fact the case, then I really have a hard time trying to say, how is it that property has remained as it is in such a deplorable state? At one point, right before Christmas, up until past Christmas, almost the entire primitive fencing on Moshasak street was on the ground several weeks before that was addressed. So if there's weekly communication, telephone meetings, and they hired someone to do the inspection weekly and submit reports, how does that happen? I don't get that. Until, you know, I and the community come together and ask for something to happen, nothing happens. The entire side of Greenville street is just so terrible, with trash all over the place. And I believe the last core report that they had submitted, they had mentioned about setting up a fence behind ten rocks on the annex property to make sure it doesn't end up as a dumping ground. Well, it was never done. This was the report back in June wasn't done. So they were reiterating something that they already said was going to be done, which isn't done. So this entire thing is terrible for the community. It's terrible for the health and safety of the community. It's a present danger. And we shouldn't have to constantly be asking this developer and the city's owning and department to be. They all have a responsibility to maintain. If the developer is not doing it, the zoning director, planning department have a legal responsibility to make sure it's done and then charge the developer. These are basic things. Two years constant. And the other thing is, again, as it's been mentioned, and they continue to report, they don't have the financing to do anything with that property, short of trying to steal morley feel from the community. So here we are, two years, no funding, places the same looks terrible each time after gospel beyond them. And what are we doing about it? And if this costs of communications they're suggesting, then blame needs to be a boat. The administration as well as the developer, there's no other response to that. I mean, that's all I'm going to say on those two items. So I have in terms of item f, and that's the communication from the director of the recreation, John Blay. I appreciate him responding back to us. And based on his letter, he's confirming that the last time the annual status of the parks in the city was submitted would have been in 1994. Let me see if I can find that. It was 94. 90 what? 94. Yeah, 94. So. And to me, that's extremely concerning. You have an ordinance that requires an annual report on the state and status of the parts in all the city. And as I've been done since 1994, notwithstanding, the statue on point, to me, that's concerning. None was done in 2022. So hopefully, he says, that they decided to put one together for 2023. But from 1994 until now, we've had several parks, public parks, protected parks with the LWCF, that have been converted unlawfully. They've been taken away, and all sorts of things done.

And had this reports been conveyed to the council and the people of Tuckett on a yearly basis, these sort of things would not have happened. And what's currently happening in Wally Field would not be a current situation. But this is why these sort of ordinances are in the charter is to protect the people's public recreational land. And we get a report, and we haven't been getting a report. Nobody's saying anything about the fact that there's been no reports since 1994. To me, that's shameful. And an entire section of the city is losing on an incremental basis, all of its green space, its public parks. The kids are being affected. And these are the most vulnerable population here, environmental justice population. Kids living in mostly three deckers, no front yard to play in, just taking their parks and converting them. So I'm not sure if this is the city's idea of how development, economic development, happens in the city. So steel take away from the most vulnerable. Reverse Robin Hood. So you take from the poor, and the vulnerable give to the rich to develop. In the meantime, what do they have the situation at, Wally? The last clean space in that entire neighborhood. After they take that away, and I'm hoping that's not going to happen. They'll be left with Paine Park, a basketball court, court with a playground, nothing more. Because everything else is being taken increment. And all of this happened between the years here, 1994 to now. And that's all I'm going to say on it. Thank you. All right, thank you, councilor. I don't believe there are any more correspondence, so I guess we're on to item three. Item three is a communication from his honor, Mayor Donald Grebian to the honorable members of the Pawtucket City Council, submitting the following appointment as a member of the personnel board for confirmation. William H. Rogerio, 55 row Avenue in Pawtucket. Term expires the first Monday, January of 2025, to fill the unexpired term of Gary J. Convertino.

Councilor Moreno. Yes. Councilor Koviak? Councilor Wilderness. Yes. Eight to zero. Number four is a resolution opposing cuts to RIPTA services in Kentucky and requesting service to 100 freight Street. I move for approval on a roll call vote. Second, the move by councilor Kojak. Second by councilor Rugio that a resolution opposing cuts to rip to services in Pawtucket and requesting service to 100 Freight street be approved. Any discussion on the resolution, counselor? Thank you to Councilor Rubio with the help from leadership to get this resolution on today's docket. Basically, the resolution is opposing cuts that are going to affect the Pawtucket Route 7173-7576 a lot of our residents, RIPtA is their lifeline, so this would be tragic for them. And then in addition, this resolution is also pointing out that we are moving to a temporary city hall and expanding the roots versus cutting them. And even so, expanding to 101st street is very important to our city and our residents. Thank you, councillor. Anyone else? Yes, I want to thank Councillor Skoviak for bringing this up last meeting. And Councilor Rubio, who's not here, who helped penn it as well, author it. And yes, it's very important that, you know, they don't cut these routes. City residents, really, a lot of people really rely on these. And I can't stress the importance enough of having public transportation in front of our relocated temporarily or permanently, whatever the future holds our city hall, because, you know, daily business goes on there. Residents need to go in and out of our city hall. So I'm hopeful that they understand and our urgency for not cutting these routes and adding the freight street drop off and pickup. I really feel strongly about it and I hope they do as well. So thank you for your leadership on that and Councilor Rubio's as well. Thank you, councilor. I'm glad you brought up Councillor Rubio. She's not here tonight, but this was important to her and she wanted to make sure we got the ball rolling on this. So, Nelson, further, Eric will call the role. President Mercer. Yes. Councilor Rugo.

I had mentioned about a month or so ago that I intended to appoint a, what I'm calling a city hall building review ad hoc committee. The idea is that we will look at every possible aspect of what to do with this building, whether it is fixing it and bringing it up to a 21st century office building and seat of government and returning from Freight street or something else. There's a pretty hefty price tag that's been suggested for that. And my hope is that we can look for every possible way to accomplish that. And for that committee could take as long as twelve months, if not longer. And I would like to assign this starting April 1. And there will be three members from the council, three members from the administration, and three members from the citizens at large. I've asked Councilor Rugio to chair this, and he has agreed to do so. I've asked councilor Moran to be the vice chair and he has agreed to do so. And councilor Rubio was very much interested in serving as the third council member, the mayor himself or his designee from the administration, someone appointed by the administration, from the planning department. I think it's going to be the assistant director and somebody from public works. And then we have three folks from the citizens at large. Miss Barbara Zardevsky, who is the. From the Pawtucket Preservation Society. I think that's an important voice we need to hear. Mister Kevin Minotti, who is a lifelong Pawtucket resident, second generation builder and construction expert, to be perfectly honest with you, and member of the zoning board. So he knows a lot about all of those things. And finally Mister Kevin Barry. He is not related to former counselor John Barry and he's got quite an extensive background including being the number two person at the Quonset Economic Development Corporation with expertise in development and grant funding. Again, a lifelong Pawtucket resident at least both Kevins Miniati and Barry are lifelong Pawtucket residents. I don't know about Barbara, but I do know that she is dedicated to preservation and dedicated preservation specifically in Pawtucket. So with that I hope I've put together a good committee for you consular Rugio and again the charge is go in with an open mind, see what can should reasonably can be done with this building and take as long as we need. There is no rush. We know we're going to have to move over to Freight street and there'll be quite a bit of time to do whatever we have to do. So don't rush it, but be thorough. Well, thank you for choosing me to chair this very important committee. It's an honor to serve. I want to thank Councilor Moran and councilor Rubio who's not here to serving on ourselves. So thank you for that. And yes, there's no. This is an open ended committee. We don't know what will be done with this building. That's the point of the committee. Try to figure out what is the best use of this building if there is a use for us. So I'm looking forward for the committee to start working. So thank you, thank you. No further business. I'll counsel motor Council. I'm sorry before we adjourn tonight, I got a few things that I'd like to take care of. I apologize, I didn't see you. That's fine. I know I'm in the corner and I disappear a lot. First off I want to thank my colleagues for their condolences, the ones that came tonight and expressed it for my mother in law that passed. And I also want to thank you from my Cape Veridian family for the flowers that you sent. It was really appreciated. My mother in law loved flowers most of all. I guess I want to thank her for the last 20 years of my life and bringing nothing but love and joy and for the 92 years of her life that she was part of a community, unfortunately, wasn't tuck. It was Central Falls. But she was part of a cape verdean community that loved her, her family loved her and mourn her, as we all saw tonight, and we lay her tomorrow into eternal rest. And I want to thank you all for the condolences that you've sent to me and my family, and just let you know it's appreciated. And I'd like to. To turn around and adjourn tonight in the memory of Dominguez Duat. We will certainly do so, councilor. We're happy to do so. Happy to commiserate with Maria and her family. And the fact that there were hundreds upon hundreds of people in line for her wake tonight speaks to what that family, that big family means to the central falls community and the Pawtucket community and beyond. So she will be missed. She raised a wonderful family and lived a good life. So we will adjourn in memory of Dominguez Duarte. It. Thank you. They actually put her.

All those in favor? Aye. Let's go with Lieutenant Skahan. First you want to give us a brief overview of what's going on. We're up to seven days a week now. Over there, the hours are, have they changed or they just back to the way they were? They've changed slightly. We used to break for an hour for lunch. Yeah. Now we're straight through. So the hours are currently ten to three months. Friday, ten to two. Sunday. There's no more lunch break in the middle of the day. Okay. So a little bit more. Went a little bit longer. Okay. Sorry, what's the weekend? We get ten to two on Sunday, ten to three. Allies. And anything else? As far as updates with there, I can give you some, some brief improvements we've made in the short time we've been working there. At council request, we have a pizza log and I regret that I didn't get any of the information. Was clerk in time? I wasn't aware of the deadline. I will have it next meeting. Okay. Writing us a copy of some of the tenants? Yep. We do visualize. We're tracking tenants for over a month now. The DPW came in, they secured our kennel access. So we can ensure that nobody's going in there unless given direct permission and escorted. We got our Facebook access to the page that we have access been given to all shelter staff. They've all gotten training on it. So now we immediately address the backlog of comments going back to the beginning of this year and comments are being addressed as they come in. We're also engaging community letter Facebook access. TPW came out and replaced some of the cleaned up and replaced exterior features, including the signs and exterior appearance of the building. Okay. We secured interior cleanup. We got a donation from Home Depot to I saw that they did a very nice job. We cleaned and painted most of the interior filling. I'd like to thank Home Depot for that, that contribution that they made. I met some, one of their employees and they said that they had extra supply of paint and stuff. And then they volunteered and came out and did a nice job. Fantastic. They were excellent. Now we've been continuing to just get animals adopted at the regular rate. We have some upcoming improvements planned. Urge to improve computers. We're working with the it department to improve phone access. We're still waiting on auto attendant, which will. One of the complaints that's been ongoing is the inability to use staff at all times. Once this auto attendant is up and running, that should resolve that complaint. We're also working on fresh to streamline that application we have right now. It's a little clunky, but once the new website is up, more streamlined version on there. And we're still working on implementing the volunteer program to start with city hall employees, not completely on that. I want to thank you for that. Number one, too. I want to thank the staff over there. I know with our recent boarding situation that we just had this week, you guys are full out over there. So I want to also thank the public for reaching out. I've understood that they've reached out to you and people willing to donate and volunteer and everything else. I thank them for that. I would also ask people to have the patience to give you guys a couple of weeks to process the animals and figure out. And then you said you were working with the SPCA. Yes. And has there been a determination on how many animals are going to get left here in Pawtucket and how many animals are going. There's no determination at this time. We're working with the SPCA and multiple other groups. They've asked that we did not be named this time. They're going to release on their own press releases. Yeah. We have at least four organizations, our SPC, working with us to give us veterinary care, home the animals, clean the animals. All the things need to be done. It's going to be involved, hands on vent situation. We do have many other shelters and other organizations that are volunteering. We can't say exactly how many animals are only in still in the early phases, but what is normally the process for when you take an animal in? And by the way, I got through the quarterly report and I appreciate that. And I want to thank.

She'll make sure the rest of the committee members have it so that we can turn around, but I reviewed it and I appreciate it. What's the timeframe for when an animal gets brought in? That it gets checked out and then usually gets posted for adoption. So typically we can do that immediately, within a day or two. With so many dogs, just the lack of veterinarians in general. We're sending out the dogs in batches. I would presume by the end of next week, all the animals will have their initial check. All the dogs need to be at this point because of the condition, need to be sedated, fully groomed so we can get access. Skin is fur on them, they need to be vaccinated, and that's before we can begin the process of vetting them out. Councilor Rubio, you have any questions? Pretty much all of them. All right. The only thing that I, again, like I said, I would ask the public to give the kennel a couple of weeks to turn on. Let us go through the animals and make sure they're up for adoption, too. And I know Hershey's got some updates on the website that might help you guys later on with this process. So why don't we just go right into that too, if you want to do that. Sure. I brought handouts, so when strip out. So I did a couple of things. I just wanted to point out the website, I'll also show it up on my computer here. But the website itself, when you get there, it's going to link from the shimmy site. It'll link directly here. So we'll have everything that we have on pet finder, plus more on our site. So if somebody does go through pet finder and find the animal, they'll find them there. But at least we're first starting off by going to the target's website, find them here so they're not kind of diverting in a different direction. A couple of things I want to point on the site is the hours. It will be up here right on the front page. So this is a live view right now. The site, I don't have it launched because I wanted to show the community here first before we hit live. And then there's a section there for the application right there where the animals are, they can click. And that's where we'd like to kind of streamline the application because like I said, it's a little clunky right now with all of the information we're asking there. So we're going to have a new signup form there. The animals that we have and actually have graphics. This is live as of yesterday, will all be right on the page here. So there'll be a picture description. The description can be as much as we want or as little as we want. What I did right here is I just grabbed them from Patchfinder and I just copied and pasted in here. It took me about, I would say a minute of peace to do this, which is a great opportunity. Like I said, we get volunteers to this page as we write. And so those are the animals that we've had. The footer of the area. The one thing I want to point out is the website and the front page itself. We do have links to their current Facebook. Instagram is also on there. It's also as far as I wanted the site to be multilingual, to translate. So right up at the top, if I click at the bottom, there'll be a drop down. It comes up with languages. So I speak Portuguese. So let me just pick the portuguese one. And everything will automatically translate, including the hours. The application over here will have the multiliners, but all the description of the animals will also translate. And I see the one for adopt where you click on that and go, now what about if you chose to want to volunteer and may not make out an application volunteer. And I see you have it there. We have it there. We put another link as well. Go over to it and then also there's a volunteer page that's there. So what I like to do on the volunteer page right now, I didn't have the material yet, but I like to take pictures of actual volunteers within the site. So we use our own people would be nice. But right now, if you go to volunteer page right now also listing volunteer opportunities because we may be looking for something specific and somebody might go there and say, I want to volunteer. Or also donations, we can also put on the site. So the site is basically ready to go. I like to. We can add to it. It's not like it's not a one and done. Anytime we make a website, make sure that it's up to date. Okay. I have a question about the, in regards to the multi language component. Do you have to update in different languages? No. Or just you update it in English and it automatically transferred correct. What's the accuracy in translation? It's pretty, I mean, it does use a Google, Google translate on the back end. So you're going to modify like monitor that because I know some translations, like for example in Spanish, don't always translate correct accurately. And I think sometimes it's the wording. So absolutely we can we can do that. The one we're using is G translate, which is one of the better ones for WordPress sites. That's out there.

But 100%, some of the words, I think sometimes paragraph structure is different than just basically two words together. Sometimes it just ends up saying a completely different, completely different sentence. Absolutely. I'd be kind of. Absolutely. The other point I actually mentioned, we also add the other PC at once. It goes live with the ADA accessibility because visual and things like that is also important that you can change the contrast and everything else that we're at. The website, it's not on here, it's a tech site and it's also mobile friendly. So the same site that's there is right now on phone in general, you don't modify. So it's a responsive site that would build on that. Now the application that does that go directly to a drive or is that a live application within the website? So the city currently was using a jotform application where they were filling it out. We're going to convert that over to a form application that's built into the WordPress. So they'll be able to both get an email as well as being. So they automatically get notified as soon as they submit. Correct? Correct. We just have to decide. And that form, is that based on what's already there or have we modified that to make it more current? We're going to work on that. So the existing form. Yeah, it's clunky. I want to work with Hersh on that. We'll find one that has all the information we need, which can kind of be a barrier to injury. People want to adopt the dog. They eventually want to fill out the entire application ahead of time. They just want show interest. So we reach out to them. But we'll have to work on exactly what information we need to make sure to get in contact. People aren't going to have this now, I know you mentioned. Is there the newsletter? Can you say a newsletter or something that goes out via Facebook? Oh, we should have our Facebook post. We were just doing more regular posts now, which for the last two years we didn't have access. We want to make the posts now that we have access again. We started making regular posts and communicating with. I'm wondering if it makes sense to collect their email information for monthly newsletters or something. Sure. That people could stay lesser. Exactly. And I don't know how you feel about that, but more access, less, that's fine. And the more access and more visibility and the more chances we have of these animals being adopted out. And that's. That's what this has always been about. So you have any other further questions, counselor? I'm all. Lieutenant, you have any other thing you want to add before we move on to number four? Okay, number four, then. Councillor Rubio, an ordinance and amendment of chapter 116, ordinances of the city of Pawtucket, 1996, entitled impoundment fees. I move to take this out. It's been moved by Councilor Rubio, seconded by Councilor Wilderness. We take up the ordinance for the amendment of chapter eleven six dash four, the code of ordinances for state of Pawtucket entitled impound fees. All those in favor? Aye, Lieutenant. And this is you. You've gone through this. I got the information ahead of time. So if you want to explain it to the committee, what you're looking for, I'd be more than happy to. Yes, sir. So, currently, per ordinance, we are charging $5 per day at the shelter for any animal that is in our shelter. That $5 is explicitly spent. $3 of the five we collect goes to the full fund. The remaining two is allocated by the keeping of animals. Those two amounts are put in different funds, one of which is controlled by the animal control committee, the other one which is used for daily operations. Each other. The expenses, it appears, have not been updated since 1996. Decided to look and compare with other shelters $5 per day at the low end from most other shelters in the area. I compared with with various local shelters. Many of them do charge $5. However, all those shelters also charge a pickup fee. A pickup fee would help to make up the cost spent when our and patrol also have to go out and pick up those animals, and then other shelters charge higher amounts. For instance, Lincoln Cumberland charge $15 per day in addition to pickup fee. Northern female charges $8 per day with addition to pickup fee, and the RiSPCA charges $30 per day. They do not have pickup fee. Just today, I received a mailing from the RIS PCA in reference to the Horton case where they mentioned it costs over $30 per day to maintain the animal in their facility. Essentially, this $5 a day while the money is used to take care of animals. Every day that we keep an animal in the shelter ends up being a greater expense. So we had suggested that we add a pickup fee to accommodate for the amount of money that our amount of time surface our Amtrak spending and increase our daily fee to $10 per day and to allocate that fee the same. We were previously split between the animal control fund and the daily expenses but just spend $5 into each account rather than two and three.

We were previously split between the animal control fund and the daily expenses but just spend $5 into each account rather than two and three. And I understand the medical cost it's passed on is based on, you know, what, what we're having to deal with when we deal with a vet. So any medical cost that we incur while we are taking care of somebody's animal. So for instance, if we find a loose animal, we currently charge that $5 per day and no other expenses if medical care needs to be treated. If you find a dog has a broken leg, we take the dog in, we charge $5 per day, the dog is there and we charge dollar for dollar the medical expenses back. So if our vet charges us dollar 500 care for that broker type, we would pass that dollar 500 on to the dog owner. That is by practice. Currently it's not in the ordinance. I would recommend we keep it that way because it allows us to reduce or waive those fees in the event that somebody had a hardship and cannot pay those fees. We can get them a dog back, but it also allows us to recoup all of the money in the event that we incur significant charges for veterinary determine that the person who owns the dog is capable of paying those fees and is responsible. No, it all makes total sense. I'm okay with that. Well, then you want to. Yeah, I'll make a motion to approve the ordinance. The ordinance change. Okay. Motions are made by Councilor Rubio, second by councillor wilderness to adopt the changes to the ordinance and make a full recommendation to the council. As such. All those in by roll call vote. Council, yes. Councilor Rubio, yes. Two to zero. No further business before the animal control committee. We are adjourned. After you guys put in your. That was in my package you sent to the house. So I'm just saying I usually bring it with me, but just. Do we have an amended again? Hold on, let me check and see if I got it here. I know. No, no, I might have to retake the picture. I just need one even stretch. And that's why that and made it with the black rub that way. But I know I wouldn't do. It's okay. I'll call order. The finance committee meeting clerk will call a roll. Chairman Wildingham. Councilor Moran. Yeah. Councilor Rubio here. No public input or anybody online. Do I still have one member that's joined us online? If you're here to speak at public input this evening, please raise your hand by using the raise hand feature at the bottom of your screen. No, I see none. Okay, then we'll go with number two in ordinance and amendment of chapter 202 of the Code of ordinances in the City of Pawtucket, 1996, entitled Fees return checks. I guess. Motion to take up a motion made by council Marin, seconded by councilor Rubio to take up an ordinance in an amendment of chapter 202 of the Code of Ordinances, the city of entitled fees return checks. All those in favor taking it up? Aye. What are we going to do on this, Mark, both of us? And this is basically, this is basically increasing the fees to what we're having to pay. Yeah, well, long and short of it is this, is that these fees have not been adjusted in so long that it actually cost the city money when someone bounces a check, cost us. So we need at least recover our costs for bounce checks. And Irina has done some surveys of what the fees are in some other communities around the area. I'll turn that part of what's occurring. We'd like to make a recommendation. Right. So it was brought to my attention when tax collectors association conducted the survey about the NSFPs in each communities. So most communities are above our threshold so they have higher accept tax fees. The next step we did looked how we are processing those fees, what's the volume, how long it takes to process, what's the procedure? And we did realize that it needed to be taken care of. Trees are impossible. Plus $10 these days. It's not really like, it's not punishment. People ignore it. What is, do you have the costs associated that we've incurred at this point? Well, typically what's happening if we have, for example, one return check, we have someone in our department that enters the system, reverses payment, adding fees not to files by reading letter whoever violated that account out of balance. And then we're waiting. What's happening then? And it's usually time and effort of the staff. Yeah, and plus we are paying typically what's happening. It depends on what bank and what, depends what department has return checks. But for example, our major TDB, they charge $40 and 30 minutes, charges $10 for that. Okay, so what are we going to again, I do believe I proposed $20.30. So is that the highest overall in your analysis that banks are charging variable charges, 35 banks. You have to understand that sometimes, for example, water department, they're being even not charged up. It's all fees of wait. But that's a penalty and it's a fee. Not really fee. It's a penalty for during one thing. So I do believe that they have higher than $30.

An ordinance and amendment of the schedule of pay rates for classified non union positions in section 80 812 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Pawtucket, 1996 to add human resources director and to delete consolidated director of human resources. I move to take this up. It's been moved by Councilor Rubio, seconded by Councilor Moran, that we take up an ordinance and amendment and schedule pay rates for classified nonunion positions in sections 80 812 of the Code of Ordinances, the City of Pawtucket and add human resource director and delete consolidated human resource directive. Mark or Mister Holt, which one's going to take this way? All those entailed. You and I have had some discussions along with the current human resource director. So. And the committee hasn't been party to those. So if you want to take a brief overview for them while they ask any questions. So the chairman and I had some conversations about the current proposal that we have before you and the potential amendment to it. That we still accomplish what we're looking to accomplish, but would not create two new hay bridges. So we changed this instead of right now we have it as 22 x. We've changed next 22. It give the director position the same salary range, but just would not require you all to create two new grades in the pay plan as it currently sits. We trying to get this accomplished because everybody knows we're in a very, very competitive. We do not currently have a human resource director. We have an interim who's working right now, doing a great job, but he's on the interim and charging to. Sorry, he's not somebody who wants to take on the job. Postman find something for an organization size and complexity as a city dealing with several different unions, with a large amount of employees, dealing with all of the other instances that come with just running a large organization, we feel that having the position of director makes it a much more palatable item or for a recruit to have and a salary range that is competitive still immediately better with the private sector, definitely lower than we can get in the private sector, but it puts us in a better position than we currently are. Was it ever director of human resources before that way back in the day or. No, we had, I believe the consolidated director came in when we tried to mix the school, the school and the city to have one human resource director through our discussions, just like Lieutenant Skahan said in the previous meeting that we had here, that a lot of these things haven't been changed in 20 years. And, you know, the discussion I had was my uncomfortability of making two new pay grades within a category to accommodate this when it already existed in another category. And I know the administration's interest right now is purely to get it posted and get it out there and stuff like that, too. My feeling is that a director of human resources should be in the category with other directors. And we've had some conversation that in order to accomplish that, it would have to be a charter change. And that might have happened, you know, might not have happened over 20 years ago, but even human resource director's responsibilities and with the state and the federal government have changed, too, to that category, because they made me understand that the human resources director answers to the finance director. So it is essentially a function of the finance department, if I'm not mistaken. So that. And then the clerk and I had some discussions, and it really gets convoluted then. So this sounds like it's something for us to discuss in the future, but not to hesitate to allow them to go out and get a new HR director, which is essential for the. For the running of the administration to make sure that all the federal and state laws are being abided by. So we've come to the point that I believe, at least in my opinion, that there was no need to add two new positions in the 40 hours ranks or pay periods in it. We could do that just by the one that's in the 35 hours ranks, let them go out, advertise it, and then at this point, the administration can come back to the council and discuss either a charter change or the reason for or not to have it. And then we'll have those more thorough discussions, maybe after somebody's in place, but also to indicate that the person coming in would be told that there are going to be possible di", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Pawtucket", "insights": [{"observation": "An ordinance and amendment of the schedule of pay rates for classified non-union positions to add human resources director and to delete consolidated director of human resources.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Discussion about making HR director position more competitive to attract candidates in a challenging employment environment.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Refinement of pay grades to avoid creating two new grades but still achieve desired HR recruitment goals.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The need to adhere to federal and state laws in HR practices was emphasized.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Planning charter changes for long-term adjustments to HR director roles and responsibilities.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City of Pawtucket", "insights": [{"observation": "An ordinance and amendment of the schedule of pay rates for classified non-union positions to add human resources director and to delete consolidated director of human resources.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Discussion about making HR director position more competitive to attract candidates in a challenging employment environment.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Refinement of pay grades to avoid creating two new grades but still achieve desired HR recruitment goals.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The need to adhere to federal and state laws in HR practices was emphasized.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Planning charter changes for long-term adjustments to HR director roles and responsibilities.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1656548, "chunk_end_time": 2149548, "base_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240410&iCurrentPosition=6240", "chunk_url": "https://vid.opengovideo.com/playvideoiframe.asp?sFileName=http://video.clerkshq.com/RI_Pawtucket_CityCouncil_20240410&iCurrentPosition=1656"}, {"start": 24000, "end": 30000, "text": "n of the finance department, if I'm not mistaken.

So it will allow us to comment it because we also know that Sarah Miranda left recently, so it leaves us a vacancy down there. And I believe Lisa is going out on maternity leave. So that department is going to be really cut short. Staff. Two people. Two people on maternity. And as the clerk pointed out to me in the past, our finance director became the HR director in the past, too. I'm sure he doesn't want any responsibility. So the opportunity for us to get somebody in place so that they can determine what the laws are and stuff and make sure they're enforced, I think would be in our best interest at this point. So I agree with the amendment. I'll leave it up to the committee. So what are we doing again? Explain this to me. So we're going from. We're just changing the. You can get rid of, you see these two pay. Put these two pay rates which are added. Yeah. You're going to get rid of those. Right. And instead of going to a 22 x, you got to go to an x 22. No, I understand x 22. So what's the pay ranging after the x 22 foot? HR 95, which is what they were looking to add. It was going to be really. No, there's no change per se. It's a technical change. It's not a solid change. Yeah, but not substantive to the proposal. Proposal. Basically what you can do is the same, just like do it. Do the same thing that we're proposing just in a year, and we'll be changing the name to director of human resources rather than consolidating. Director. Yeah. So this would change the name. So this would change. Correct. Correct. And it would be under that pay schedule. But wait, but you're proposing that. But you made it sound like we're going to come back and do some later. Go ahead. So there is potentially discussion around reforming the role, but we would need it under charter review. Oh. So basically changing it right now, as per se, falls under finance. But it might be time to revisit that. All right. So this is one step maybe of another step that they have. That feels odd. We would need to change the chart. I got that from legal. We sat down with Frank, and Frank told us that that would have. He reviewed it. And again, that's how I found out it fell under the finance director's position. And when you look at it, you're talking a director of human resources. I thought it just naturally fits with other directors. And some of their responsibility, as pointed out to me, does not happen that way. So you have to. We have to really review it and see where it would actually fit and whether or not the change actually makes sense. But that. That could be a discussion down the road, I believe that's right. And that. And voting for this has no impact on that going down. Currently. It's a division. Correct. It's a division of the finance department. As it's payroll, as it. As tax collections, as assessor, as a purchasing. They're all divisions of the finance. Because everything back that was done in 52, everything that had to do with money, was put under the finance. Got it? Yeah. So I'll make a motion to approve the request. I'll second. As amended. As. As amended. As amended. Yeah. Well, you gotta move with the amendment. The thing is, you move the amendment and then you move to your ordinance as amendment. Okay, so make a motion. Move the amendment. Motion been made to move the amendment by Councilor Moran. Seconded by council Rubio to eliminate the new pay rates in x 21 from 85 to 110 to an x 22 from 95 to 120. And number two, change the pay rate for the new director of human resources position from an x 22 to a. Excuse me. To. From a 22. X to an x 22. We'll do that by roll call. Chairman Wilderness. Yes. Councilor Moran. Yes. Councilor Rubio? Yes. And then as amendment. Okay. Then. Then it would be to approve the audience, as amended and recommended to the full council by roll call to Chairman Wildenheim. Yes. Councilor Maria. Yes. Councilor Rubio. Yes. Three to zero. Thank you very much. Thank you. No further business before the finance committee. We are adjourned. But other people come in, get their work done and you got.

And item three is a communication from Albastiano, the president of sleep and heavenly peace, to the Honorable Terrance Mercer, council president. That is the peace of apex. I move take up items two and three. All right, moved by Council momento. Second by Councilor Rudra. That we take up item number two and three. Number two is communication from Bianca M. Palacostro, executive director of Pawtucket Redevelopment Agency. To the honorable members of Pawtucket City Council. Sleep in heavenly peace. Request 100 Main street. As well as communication from Gail Sabastayo. President, I don't know if I pronounced that right. Okay, President sleep in heavenly peace to the honorable Terence E. Mercer, council presidents, elise of apex building space. All right, motion has been to take up these communications. Miss Sebastian, can you explain what your organization is and why they're interested in apex property? So we're currently made up of 914 members. We're a nonprofit organization made up of all volunteers and of a faculty. And we're looking to support building beds for children sleeping on the floor. So we needed a space to start off or a nonprofit that starts to build and grow. Great. And what service are you providing? Who are you providing the services to? So we're providing the services to the community, to families and children that don't have beds. They contact us through our website, through an application process. And then we contact them kind of to deliver the beds. The beds include not just the frame of the twin bed, but also all the winners that go with it. So they get the pillow, the comforter, the mattress, mattress protectors and such at no cost to them. Fantastic. Council, do you have any questions? Okay, Councilor Milo, so we've got a sublease agreement. Could you kind of. Yeah. So based on the information that I was given, I didn't reinvent the basic template. The sublease that the council approved relative to Qualcomm Electric who was before you back in December. Yes, also looking to sub space. So really the only changes, most of the provisions that were in the service as well, just the pertinent provisions such as the premises, the use of the premises. So in this particular instance, they're interested in exams. From what I understand, approximately 3000 school fee in the area, formerly as the apex garden side, you know, as opposed to side, main structure. Correct. Right. Basically a month to month lease with three month notice, which is exactly what we want to see. So again, to be consistent with what we did previous summits, see month to month, three months notice, potential tender line with that. Generally speaking, that's pretty much what it is that we want to deviate major wave by actual edge of. The only thing that is still kind of a work in progress, though, on this is we don't really get a chance to talk until this happens. And so there is still some ongoing discussion about parking spaces and what will be allocated and for parking. Okay. So we're going to continue to talk about that over the course of the next week or so, and if we decide that we need that specific parking, we'll do that. I'll get that up to. So. Okay. And we can just, you know, if we decide as a committee to approve this lease, even if there's any amendments to it, we just. Okay. To improve it on the floor. The full council, right? Yeah. Just want to make sure you're all set. Yeah. All right, well, I don't have any further questions, so. Because you spelled it out, and it's a month to month to help, you know, to lease to this nonprofit that's going to be working, making beds for families with children and eat. Right. All right, I have no further questions to you. Approve items? Well, it would be a motion to sublease, right? Yeah. Motion to put a resolution together to bring a resolution to the full. All right, so it's been motioned by Councillor Moreno, seconded by Councilor Larudo, that we approve the creation of a resolution for the sublease agreement to sleep in heavenly peace at the apex site, bring it to the full council for their approval. Any further discussion, Councillor Rugio? Councilor Moreno? Yes. No further business coming from public reading. Motion to motion. Motion by Councillor, second by Councilor Ludro, that we adjourn this meeting. All in favor? Aye. Aye. Thank you. Thank you.

Councilor Rugio councilor Moreno. Councilor Rubio. Three. And attend. There is no compromise, correct? No. Then item number two, consolido, if you like to take backwards, take one out of vehicle related claims. I'll take it up. Wait, I'm sorry. Item number two, vehicle related claims number one. The first one is Tara L. Gagnon for $275.33 for a pothole. It's moved to take that out. Sorry, move by councilor secretary. By councillor. That would take up the claim of Tara El Gagdin for $275.33 per poto. I see that as we were reading the inspection report, this was in Central Avenue and it was here. This was a cutout for Rhode island energy, Mister Castle. Ovid, did you agree with that? Yes. Okay. All right. And let me see something. I had a question. I'm not sure. What was this one? Okay. It was, uh, within the given timeline, too, as well. But again, there was evidence that there was a cutout, um, by virtue and energy. Um, so, you know, any. Any discussion on this? No. I'll make a motion to refer to virtual energy. All right, I'm going to put deny and deny. Okay, thank you. It's the motion of a councilor. You'll be a secondary by counselor Romino that we deny this claim and refer them skagnum to Bolan Energy. Roll call, please. Councilor Ruja. Yes. Councilor Moreno? Councilor Rubio? Yes. All right, next up is a claim for Doreen towering. It's in the amount of $189.78. Since it is for a pothole, I move to take it up second. It's been moved by counselor. Seconded by Counselor Rubio, that we take up the flame of Doreen Maori and the amount of 189. 78 for a pothole. Okay, I noticed. If anybody wants to. I noticed in the inspection field. Inspection report, again, this was energy issue. And I did have a question on this council. Milos, this was past seven days. That's. Is that something that Rhode island energy has to abide by to that statute? I mean, if we normally deny and refer to them, do we. I'm not sure about the statue and how that applies or affects Rhode island energy. I don't know that there's a seven day rule that applies to Rhode island energy. Okay, I know how we would handle it if the claim had gone to Rhode island energy inadvertently. We know the committee typically then will look to see what was the day that filed with them. I don't know. They'll do that here. Okay. Thomas, the casalova. Do you have anything on this? All right, and refer to morale energy. Second moved by council Moreno. Seconded by councilor Lubio that we deny the claim of domain Maori and refer her refer to burial energy. Any further discussion? Councilor Rugio? Yes. Councilor Moreno? Yes. Councilor Rubio? Yes. Three to zero. Anthony Dean for a pothole for $467.06. I move to take this up. Second of a consular marino that would take up a claim of Anthony D. Megalillo. I'm sorry, the meglio in the amount of $467.06 for pothole. Motions them to take this up. This is one of those rainbow issues. Mister Kostlovich, do you have anything to maybe weigh in on this? Yeah, this pothole, I guess, was never reported to us. We went out upon receiving the investigation of the report from the city clerks and it was already filled. So it must have been either noted by our crew when they were out doing potholes and sort and filled it or something, that it was a pothole that was on the city side. So it was a city pothole and it wasn't above and it's Whistler way road. I don't think this. No, this was not a west. This is. There is. Oh, you know what? I got my apologies. I thought I picked the wrong. My apologies. No, but this one was. It was filed to the police first and then a month later filed to us. So. Which is why it was late right on the date of the occurrence. But it was on time to say they filed it with the police. They filed the plan where they just contacted. So the time frame claims committee. Oh, I see. She says she was the first. Yeah, I'll leave that up. So what say the committee? I mean, what are your thoughts on that? I mean, I think it was a mistake. They just thought they'd have to file it to the police station and not to us. I hope to approve. And it was on our end. Our mistake or. Well, not our mistake, but we filled the pothole. There was evidence that there was something there, two tires. So that was. So I wouldn't. So. Right. The only thing I'm saying is, like, what was absolutely conditions of the tires if they were won that much? But that's something. I'll leave it to the committee. Well, you know. Right, but I wouldn't approve for the full amount, but yeah, so we couldn't. And I mean, one of the things too, we could. Was there a motion on the floor? Yes, it was moved by councillor secondary, by the council that we approve the claim for the maximum amount we can is $300.

You know, a lot of times we'll go half the amount, you know, because the burden does fall on a person to put the clean in on the time. You know, my thinking would be going half the 467, but for committee, we feel strong. Well, motion would have to be amended for that. That's just my two cent on that, because I know sometimes when there's, when there's a little gray area, a lot of times that's how the direction we're going and we're going half that amount, and not even go looking at half the 300, looking at half of the four, that's just, you know, my take on that. That's how I would. But your motion is there, so, you know, we'll be the vote out of motion. Or we could, you know, we could make it recommend to. Well, that would have to come from you if you want to keep the motion. We'll vote on that. I'm all right with, with drawing the first one in. And I'm changing it. Who approval in the third? 2nd. All right, so it's been moved by council Moreno to amend, withdraw his first dollar 300 award and amended to $233.53 2nd by Councilor Rubio. Any, any further discussion? I just want to say I'm looking at the precedent. That's what we normally do, so it's not, it's so much about the Dallas assessment, you know, as we move forward, you know. All right. There's a little gray area here. That's what we generally do. I've seen since my time on the committee. Okay. Roll call, please. Chairman Arugio. Yes, Councillor Moreno. Councilor Rubio. Yes. Next office. Store idea. Hand count by travelers, which earns no amount specified just for a fire truck. And it was postponed from the 36 24 2nd. It's been moved by Councilman second by council Lubia. That would take up the claim of Alita Gonkals by travel insurance. No amount specified. Fire truck postponed from the meeting on 36 20 24. Councilor Milos, did you all get the email that was sent by the fire department as follow up put in the file it was in? Yes. So I think that was the further explanation that the committee was looking for. So from the driver's perspective, he did not believe that the plane did everything that she built vehicle on us. We weren't sure if you remember, based on what was before you last time. So the request was made of the department to have the driver supplement the inventory, what we have. So before we get into that part of it, how come there's no dollar amount specified on that one? We have a receipt claim, a summary, etcetera. You know, that was just a little confusing to me. Why there was no dollar amount associated with this. I mean, looking at it looks like there's 1140, $5.16. There was a deductible of 500 on this. And, you know, so that was the first thing. The second thing was on this one is. Yeah, you have one person, the driver of the vehicle, saying that they were stopped, the driver of the city vehicle. I just said that, but wasn't completely stopped. So there's a little, there's definitely a factual yes. So in your eyes, Carol Nylos, do you think the city was not coupled on this instance, according to the driver of the fire apparatus? He does not think he was responding to an emergency statute does require drivers to pull as far as they can. All I have now is his information, his personal first hand. Does any of the community members have anything? Sure. So I guess in this letter it says the reimbursement they're looking for is $1,145.0.16, right? Yeah. And then that looks like travelers. Right. Is the one that they pay. This is a segregation. Right. And then it looks like the $500 was some paid by the deductible. Okay. And I do, yeah, I did the driver, the apparatus did say that the driver didn't come to a complete stop moving. Is there any cameras or videos or anything in that area that we could use as a point of reference? They have. I have no idea. I mean, at this point, it's he said, she said it is. I do think, you know. Yeah, yeah. I mean, if I were, you know, I really mean, you know, with council Michaels stating that there is some, you know, evidence here that there's testimony that the person didn't come to stop. So that's a concern of mine, I'm sure. I mean, I can only tell you that that's what the driver of the city's vehicle said if claimed. This claim was denied and suit was filed, this driver would be the city's witness. His testimony that for his vantage point, claimants vehicle must ultimately it would be up to the trier back to hear versus her story. Easy answer to the question. This is what the city's driver is saying. And based on a statue, this is correct, I think based on vaccines, that really wasn't right. Obviously, city drivers, public safety drivers. So fire. They still have to obey the rules, but they have more clearance when they're responding. That's what emergency statutes say. And we rely on. Second.

But since I asked you before. Right. What do you field inspection report. Usually, you know, when it's deal with them. This, in fact, was their issue. Correct. I'll make a motion to deny and refer to the Worcester Railroad. It's been motioned by councilor Ludio, seconded by council Marino, that we deny the claim of Daniel Gosselin of $171.02 when claimant to the providence of any further discussion, please, Chairman Rucho, Councillor Moreno. Councilor Rubio? Yes. All right, excellent. Hamilton, Alice R. That is in the amount of $117. It is upright. Take it up. Second. It's been moved by council Moreno. Seconded by councilor Rubio. That would take up the claim of. To Milton Salazar. I hope I. Hamilton. Oh, it's Hamilton as an h. My apologies. All right. Hamilton Salazar, an amount of $117 for a tow. Okay, so I did read. We all read the information that was provided, Councilor Milos. The wrong paper was provided. I think it's pretty clear. Yes. How does this happen? Yep. And there was a doubt they didn't double check, right? Yep. Motion. Who approved? Second. It's been motioned by council Moreno. Seconded by councilor Rubio, that we approve the claim of Hamilton Salazar on the amount of $117. Any further discussion, roll caller, Councillor Moreno? Councilor Rubio. Yeah, three to zero. Number three. Council Jen Lisker, for the amount of dollar. 575 for a sewer line claim. I move to take this up. Move by councilor will be a second by councilor. You know, that would take up property damage. Claim of Dan Liska, $5,775 sewer line. Okay, Rick, I mean, I think it comes down to, was it out of city side or not? The claimant says it was. Have you guys confirmed that that was. It appears that they just ran a snake and pulled back snake. We did actually replace the main, the lateral for this place. So they must have found something. So you feel that this is more on a city side? This is more of a city issue in my opinion. It's. There is no answer, to be honest, because I've been researching this for years and trying to find ordinances on exactly what the city owns on these levels. I can't find anything in any of the ordinances. What's basically the property on the sidewalk? That's what we. So the question is, was this truly the ladder up to the sidewalk? Is that where the block is not known, but it's a sidewalk trail. So it would have been. The roots would have came with sidewalk trail and. Okay, so the sidewalk tree now belongs to the city. So that Rosenberg pipe. Bizarre. The roots were ours. Okay, just gotta be clear as we try to make these decisions on clavity. Yeah, I mean, I know you can't always tell. In this case, they say there was a camera. I don't know if we had access to that or. They say they were up there, but brain pop up, right. That was the private vendor that the resident contact. Right. And they said they did. And again, I don't know if this is true or not, but the city had come out, but they didn't have the appropriate apparatus. The claim, it says to take care of the issue. I'm just going by what he says. Paid out of pocket for private contract. Did it fail? A blockage sewer. The city came out, they only had a spearhead cutter to deal with the issue. Something more powerful. Now be that as it may, that still doesn't question. That sounds. Yeah, you have any questions? No. I'll make a motion to approve. It's been motioned by councilor Lubio, seconded by councilor Marino. That we approve the property damage claim of Dan Lisco in the amount of $575 Sioux line. Any further discussion, both of these. Pastor Rubio? Yes. Moreno? Yes. All right, item number four is the update on the province, honey. Right. Removed by Councillor Moreno, seconded by councilor Rubio. That update on the province of Scarrero company be taken up, Mister Miles. So I reached out to Providence in Worcester. I had talked to Chris Frawley on a few occasions. He didn't have any up to date contacts over there. He was in the process of working on it. I decided to just try and reach out. So I just simply went to the website.

And I ended up talking to a person who basically liability. He told me he wasn't the right person. That I should probably speak to the general manager. I did. He answered, he spoke.

I said I'd like to see. Set up a meeting where we had an informal discussion about the state of the defects that are in the area adjacent to the tracks. He was very amenable to that. So we did set up a zoom. Basically it was just Chris, myself and Jim. He basically told me that it's probably going to take about a year for them to get the grant money that they're seeking. But what they're intending to is to basically rehabilitate all of those existentials all the way down to Georgia in the interim. Suggested. It's terrible, Ken. He said that he was going to have their first person get in touch with Chris directly. And allow me with Chris at various locations. Better sense of what the immediate issues are, what they might do short term. While they're waiting to hopefully get grant money at some point. They suggested that as they continue to pursue the grant, they might be looking to the city for some support. I didn't think that was going to be. I'm sure that the council are happy to pass an ordinance as Oji in furtherance of that. So it wasn't a very long conversation. I'd say about maybe 2025 minutes last Wednesday or Thursday at this point. I'll take a step back, let Chris deal with the misfold here. But fierce person, see where that gets them in terms of. Like I said, short term relief on some of these issues. Especially in the. The intersections. Cottage street talks about it. Central. Walcott's bad, but maybe not as bad as central. But I mean, they definitely need to support. So I can only say that they were responsive. Answered the phone, set up the meeting. Didn't even take a week to get the except. And gave us the next point of contact. Assurances that something short. I asked if they could provide us with a little bit more information in terms of the grant that they're seeking, how much they're seeking, exactly what areas they plan on doing the repeated work. And he did say happy Chris. So it's only been a week. Not even quite a week. So I figured I would wait. Sometimes next week I'll reach out to Chris, had further communication with them. Yeah. And then I can report back to the next month. That would be fantastic. Lease from a lot of my colleagues to speak. Definitely go ahead. After you. No, no, I'm doing. I guess my question is, okay, that's a long term plan. If in the event they don't have a. Get a grant, what is that? Second option would be my question to them. That's something that we'd like to communicate to them in their letter to us or. But also, who in the interim would meet when we get the go ahead to get patches going in that area? Who pays for that? Is it the city? Well, if it's their defect, they pay more. So we get reimbursed. No, we wouldn't do the work. They would do the work. Okay. But has there been instances where they can't get to it and we do a temporary patch or anything? We added we could never touch it, no matter what situation is. Okay. I wasn't sure. That's why on these claims, it's 100% their liability. Right. So it's a statute. Absolutely. So in the claim that we. It's just approved for annual. We had reached out to a man on the phone. No, on the railroad line. But that was the night. No, that was the night we didn't pay anything. Okay. And we don't pay if it's within so many feet of the tracks. And I forget exactly what it is, but the statute spells it out. We are absolutely not responsible. We've actually been, as I've articulated to many in the past, we've had instances where we've been sued and we've gotten out of cases because based on a statute, we're just simply not responsible for that. But it cuts both ways. We're not responsible, but we don't have jurisdiction control over those areas. We can't just go out there. Anything that could potentially some type of issue or jeopardize the tracks. So it's a catch 22. Me personally, I was more than happy to reach out because, as I suggested, I think when we spoke about this a couple of months ago, I drive down to George. Horrible today. But in the last year, it's gotten worse. Some of those claims have lifted. You take that left on George Bennett onto Central Avenue. I mean, you basically just cannot take that, right? You have to circumvent, and you have to be careful even when you're coming down cottage. The gaps between the street and the tracks now have widened. But we just can't go out there and build. So we need to get them out there to take at least some temporary. Look, all I can say is this. I've dealt with Provenance of Worcester in the past. It's been a long time, though. And, boy, I gotta say, they could have just been given a slip service, but they were responsible. The two folks that I called them. I mean, they literally just. They answered their phones, which was unheard of from my perspective. And when I got the right person a second time, didn't even hesitate. He said, frank, send me an email. Simple. Some days and times I'll try and leave it. He did. He immediately responded the next day, and within a week, we had a meeting schedule. I thought I was going to chase these. That's very.

That's awesome to hear. That's really. It doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't solve the problem, but at least it shows that there's an open willingness to communicate. A part of a corrective action plan, of my knowledge would be identify the problem and fix the problem. Now, that doesn't mean it fixes it all the time. Yeah, but by, you know, their willingness to meet with Chris Crowley, identifying the problem areas and trying to mitigate some type of plan temporarily. And then I am all in favor of get a resolution going and see if we can advocate whoever they need to get there grant funding from, say, you know, because there's a lot of liabilities, a lot of people hurting, you know, their cars get hit, their money. I thought I'd go out two tires a week ago, crossing the tracks just because of that gap. But what I will do, just, I will reach out, even though when I say I'm taking a step back, it was only, I don't get involved in catching. Of course. Yeah. And so I figured, let's let Chris deal with that and I'll get involved, but what I will do is, since now I do have this kind of pipeline, just can't. But I have no problem reaching out to him, basically just saying, look, I never really thanked you for meeting with us this week. I told him that I was reporting back to the Post, kid. I would tell him that. I did. The question that was asked was, council is appreciative that we've been trying to take some short term action solutions for grant classics. I will ask because I think what would be plan b if, for whatever reason, he seemed pretty confident that they were going to get this grant money. But what if they don't? What happens next? The question. Question asking earlier, the council was asking earlier about us filling, because it says here from Gil in that claim, and that claim that denied, it says they gave us permission to fill the missing within the railroad tracks with temporary coal patch. But that's okay then that's good to know because I didn't realize. And I was speaking also in the us question in council mentioned in the past they basically said don't debt go back several years ago also industrial or joy senate at central it was really bad council wilderness involved in it and we actually replaced asphalt. Okay. So I learned something because really for years I've always heard but in this instance that's good to know that if anything kind of shows a bit of consistency in terms of now whoever it is that's in charge of they're actually letting go out there and do it. I would never just go out there and do it. Even though previous one we had permission, giving the permission, do we get reimbursed for our patches was my question. Because it's. They're doing their work, it's our manpower, the hours, supplies, it's our people that are doing it. Yes. So it's materials more than rest. Yeah. The central lab was a bigger one. This would have been a patch or might have been a couple shovel photos, you know, probably cost 5000 batch, 10,000 batches just enriching out. Yeah it was just, it appears a small one, the central lab one would have been a larger one because if I recall right at least did between the tracks and we did almost a lane, lane and a half because we actually, if I remember we had to close the street, that section of it to do the work. So when you go back to them, you know, and speak to consular Luvio's question regarding if they don't get the funding can the conversation be had that in the future any work that is done by the city get read first for that time, materials if we can prioritize the worst areas. And as you're writing down, did you happen to have any conversation regarding life, lighting and painting and all that? I didn't get into that now I focused only on, okay, just the general state of the drugs itself because that's really what I was charged with. It's more or less. Is that something that. Well, was mentioned at the council meeting. Talk to him about his meeting? Yes maybe Chris colleague, you know, mentioned, you know as they're talking to this municipal liaison, if I dare say maybe they can talk about the lighting, you know, so many cars that just miss that turn and what have you. So whether it's painting, lighting, et cetera, that would be great if when they're out there with that representative that they could bring that up as well. The only other thing that I asked was, and I don't know what the property is, but when you have the tracks, it's like an offshoot where it goes in front of the business. Historically, I know some businesses actually still utilize rail. I think most of them, though George Bennett don't. And we had a claim maybe five, six, seven months ago. We referred somebody to problems Worcester. He claimed that problems of Worcester's back because it wasn't their track. At a city's response, I clarified with the gentleman, the general manager, that he said, no, they must have misunderstood. He says, we don't believe it's your responsibility.

It's a hazard thing to drive on the city streets. What do me next you guys are going to say, refer to P. And I thought about it today. I'm like, oh, my goodness, there's no plate here. I had to go around it. Councilor Miles, I appreciate your work on this, and thank you for your efforts. Thank you. So now you can go up there and you can listen to all the bad things that I do and then up to the floor. Any further business to adjourn, second. And motion to adjourn by council. Second by council will be all favor. Aye. There we go. All set. Good. Good evening. Welcome to Becker City Law Council chambers running just a little bit behind us. Committee meetings tonight. One thing on our agenda is public input. Just one thing before we start public. I know I've heard from a couple of members that our rules require that we're not personal attacks. Things of that nature. I get it. It's kind of devolved just a little bit over the last few weeks. Entirely my fault. Not staying on top of it. So I would be better on that. And I would ask anybody who's lawful republican to refrain from any public personal attacks or political statements or vocabularies and things of that nature. With that first one sign up is Linda. How are you? Welcome. Hi. Can you bear me the green light? All right, I need some clarification on that. So who can I attack, and who can I attack? Personal attacks. There are no personal. No personal attacks. Those aren't in our bylaws, in our rules, so. Okay. Oh, so did you talk to Frank Miles before I got here tonight? No. All right, so, anyway, no personal attacks. No personal attacks. Good, good, good. So I'm here tonight for 270 something days. Frank Milos was not giving me my son's rescue report after 270 days. He came up with this. Three pages of b's. So there's a little backstory with this, because I can't see. So. And, you see, I travel and I wheelchair quite often. I went down because I thought that, you know, Frank Milos had come up with a waiver for us to sign. And it's illegal. This isn't illegal. He can't be asking people, for what reason, if they're going to get any monetary values or for the records or what you're going to use them for. And that once I signed this, that now it's not covered under HIPAA. Okay. Now, normally, you'd be like, oh, okay. So it's not covered on the HIPAA once you receive it. But there's another copy of this that I think that you might remember. I don't know. Because I think sometimes I come up here and nobody pays any damn attention. But my son's report was printed. It was not only printed. It sat on the fire chief desk. And then when I questioned where it went, the fire chief told me that he sent it to Frank Milos. And at 10:00 at night, after Frank Milo's call, called him to let him know far enough, he was upset. He said, oh, he called me back. I misspoke. I had somebody shred it. And then he told my husband that he shredded it himself. And I just. I'm really having a problem with this. Not only this. Not only this. I mean, this is three pages long. It's full of, like I said, bullshit. And I'm not finding my son's rights to his privacy array. Yeah, not only that. Not only that.

And I'm getting really tired of constantly saying, maybe you misunderstood, or maybe they're really just a jerk to everybody, but I'm really getting tired when there are. And I'm not calling anybody in particular out, but I even. I'm going to say it. I see it on the council. I'm tired of the racism in this city. I'm really tired of it. I can't see. And I had a minority woman going to help me. They took us 4 hours, and she had to read it for me. She had to push my wheelchair for me. And by the way, you know how, like, there's no AdA over at the fire department? I mean, at the police department. There's none at the five department meeting. But anyway. No Ada compliance. But anyway, I know you don't want me to attack anybody tonight, but I have a right to speak about something. Frank Milos, he brought me to court. Does everybody know that? I'm sure you all are aware, right? So Frank Milos brought me to court to tell me that the public records that I had in my possession that he gave me were not public. So it cost $9,200 because Frank hired his own attorney. Now, I think Frank is an attorney. I don't know. But anyway, besides that. Besides that, we also just found out that Frank Milos hired another attorney because Frank Milo sleep is a little game with some of my son's records. Like, he gave some of my son's records to the media. And then he pulled back, saying that they weren't public record and maternal boy sports was coming for me from the police department. Remember James Bayno? He had the third boy sports people coming to my house and everything. When. When they requested my son's file. Frank Milo's office was going to give it to him for $75. $75 for my self privacy. Now I'm going to tell you here and now that man over there is sick of coming here. You know why he's sick of coming here? Because you all just sit there and nobody pays attention. And you know what happens when you don't pay attention? Kids get shot. Kids get shot. Because nobody pays attention to what's going on in the city. And I get it. You know, I'm sitting, I'm standing here addressing you. But the public needs to know when there's problems, people stand up here and they're calling people out. It's a damn good thing when they call people up sometimes, right? So anyway, so let's get back to Frank Milos wanting to give turtle boy sports my son's file for $75. Now he's saying he can't give it to anybody. So he gave it, gave it, gave it. And now he can't give it anymore. And he has hired an attorney to now protect his again mistakes. And I'm just wondering, how many times does Frank Milos have the higher return? I think it's ridiculous. I think it's completely ridiculous. And I can see, I can see Mister McGuilderhy in here is very, very uninteresting. What I have to say. Yeah, you are. You really are.

Because that man right there, he deserves in his district, what everybody else, he'll vote for you guys to have playgrounds and everything else. And when that man got something for his community, you vote. No, you vote now. Why? Why are the kids in his community not deserving like the ones in yours? You want to shake your head? No, but we see it. We see it. I thought you weren't supposed to interact, right? You're getting called racist. But that's all I see here. That's all I see here. I'm sorry that you don't feel it. I see it. I see it. And you know what? Yesterday, you don't want anybody to say any names. You want to know something? The person I was with yesterday was so disrespected. Stop cringing. Stop cringing. The person I was with yesterday, I'm not going to say their name. They were so disrespected. Not just Monday. They were so disrespected. It was. It was ridiculous. It really was ridiculous. You know, the person kept saying, oh, my. This is not an Ellie live. I want to help you. And then the other person was trying to explain what was going on. Honest to God, racism is in this city, and we have to stop it. Enough. Enough. We're in 2024. Really? Do we really need to go through this?

I'm an artist and a retired art professor, and I am the person that, in 2016, initiated the percent for the art program in Kentucky. I researched the city ordinances from all over the country that outlined their programs, and based on that research, helped to offer the Pawtucket ordinance that was approved by city council in 2017. Since then, I have chaired the Pawtucket Public Art Committee, which is the committee of the city's commission on Arts and Culture. I am here this evening to object to the amendments that are before you today. I speak for myself and not for the Pawtucket Public Art Committee. Because the public art committee has never had a chance to meet and thoroughly review these amendments before they were submitted to the ordinance committee on January 3, my requests for meetings were denied since I requested twice. I requested to meet personally with Robert Grundy, our staff assistant, to discuss the amendments, and was ignored until finally we met yesterday afternoon, four months after my initial request. I oppose the amendments for several reasons. First, I do not see the need to a new committee titled the Public park on the committee separate from the already existing public park committee when the public park committee has provided oversight for the present for the art program for the last seven years. The amendment describes the membership and role of the new public art Fund committee in the very same language that defines the public art committee. I have had no explanation that makes sense to me as to why it is necessary to have two separate communities duplicating the same mission of overseeing the acquisitions of public art in the city. The only difference is that the public art fund committee would oversee projects funded by developers who choose to turn over their percentage obligation to the city, while the public art committee would oversee projects funded from other sources such as grants and foundation. To me, it is just confusing and adds an unnecessary level of bureaucracy to the public art program when one committee would suffice. I also oppose the elimination of a percent of city construction costs used for public art. That is, the amendment retracts that obligation. Rob explained to me that the reason for eliminating the city construction from the program had to do with funding because some funding sources prevent the use of funds for harbor since not all funding sources have this restriction. I pointed out that a simple fix insert the word eligible funding sources into the ordinance as other cities do. The first percent for art ordinance was put into place 60 years ago in Philadelphia. Today there are more than 350% for other programs in the country and I would say all of them require a percentage of city construction bus be used for public art. In fact, that requirement is the basic core of these ordinances. The state of Rhode island has a percent for the art program, as does province. These are successful programs that are working. I also object to the elimination of the use of bond funds for city construction from the program. Rob explained that the administration did not want to use taxpayer money for public art. I then pointed out that taxpayer money is already used for a number of art advance and programs in the city. Also, the percent for bond funded projects can be reduced from 1% to a lower percentage without completely abandoning that source of funding retained in the ordinance is the requirement that private developers should receive subsidies from the city must also put aside a percentage of construction costs for public art, which I agree with. But the developers also have the option of using the funds themselves for art that would be placed on their own property. How many developers do you think will really opt to turn over the city their percentage obligations rather than controlling these funds themselves? If I were a developer, I would certainly want to use the funds myself to purchase art and place it on my own property. I would want to control the type of artwork and selection of artists and own it. There is an advantage for the city to fund public art in addition to privately funded developed by the developers. The city can specify themes that reflect the values of the city, such as diversity, its history, etcetera, and the process by which artwork commissioned.

Artwork is commissioned and artists selected by the city must be conducted in a fair, open and transparent manner that requires public input. And importantly, Rhode island artists would be notified and be encouraged to apply. In conclusion, I'd like to point out that the City of Kentucky has come under public scrutiny some, not all that constant. Is it in the best interest of the city to backtrack by eliminating city construction from the descent from the art program, a program that is continuing to grow in popularity in other cities across our nation? Does the city really care about placing public art in the community when it claims to be artist friendly and a city of the artist? How do you think the thousands of those engaged in creating business who either work or live in the city, the artists, the architects, graphic artists, designers, filmmakers, photographers, the makers of fine crafts, the art teachers and professors, members of the many art organizations and art professionals from the city, many who occupy studios and offices at Armill, and those who pay taxes, will react to knowing Mississippi would rather eliminate a source of funding for public art rather than find a way to program.

Okay, so we have Mister Hatesh Patel. 5145 Country Pine Drive, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. And attorney Nicholas Lambros. 100 Midway Road, number 16, Princeton. Whereas the sellers attorney is present as well. Would you like to take this? Sure. Well, do you want to tell us today? Actually, I have a family over here. Do you have any experience going with the store? Yes, sir. I have a guest. Thank you. You said you want a gas station in South Carolina? Yes, sir. South Carolina allows feeder line and alcohol and solar gas stations. Is that your experience? Yes. Okay. Just figured out. And you're going to move from South Carolina to Rhode island. We've had a couple transfers recently in the last year and a half or so. To put the main. Patel, are you family members or associates? Yes sir. And. But they'll have nothing to do with your license. You'll have nothing to do with that. So I represent probably dozen clients tell. Yeah, and they all mostly have involved with liquor stores, businesses. Happens is oftentimes one family member may have a liquor store they didn't get experience and other family members decide to open their own liquor stores. They're all separately owned loans, their own loans, getting his own loan, everything all makes sense. Obviously they're well aware about family members. Last month I was here with another family member. It's not only that, it's a separate entity. He's a solo basically. Get back up. Just, I just recently set up a corporation. He's the sole officer and 100% sure. Last question. It's perfunctory. You've got two objections. Nothing happens until they're satisfied anyway before the license is issued. So we're all clear on that, right? Correct. So we understand we have a few more inspections that we've been scheduling so fire things like that. Letters of good standing or in the works or the seller then are necessary in order to get you the liquor license sales permits. We have a number of levels as usual to get through but we are aware of the objection we hear about that and obviously satisfy them. Release something provided in order to mix changes. Got you. Anybody else on the board have any questions? They just have you hang out right there. Probably no need to start. Do you have any objections or any concerns with anything that's going on?

I would see if you want to do a discussion ahead of time. Is that possible? I had realized that she was. Yeah, I didn't add earlier. Karen forgot what you look like. I had to see it a while ago.

All in favor of the exception of those three. First one, X Alpha. Thank you, council president. Bear with me. 1 second x is a resolution from the town of Warren, opposition to h 7983 and it deals with building code inspections. This bill and a lot of us know we're dealing with building codes, offices and managers that each town and municipalities is unique in the makeup of the way that they run their zoning offices and stuff, usually with a building inspector. And this bill will take away that building inspector's right to turn around and have jurisdiction in our municipalities, in my estimation, by setting up a new. What it states here is the state building commissioner. So it's the state government setting up another body for us to have to jump through hoops with and take over essentially the work that we do here in our municipalities. I don't think it's appropriate and I just wanted to support my opposition to that, to that bill, H 7987. The rest of the council, whether or not we send a letter to our delegation indicating our opposition to it, it would be a thank you. So how would you like to answer if you want to put together a resolution and send about the state house? Like just a letter to the committee chair? That's the clerk yourself. What do you think is the best means to turn around and voice our concern with a delegation? I would say if we wait two weeks before we have a resolution together and that much later in the session to accomplish what you want to accomplish, I would suggest sending a finding committee in the house. This is just the house that we send it to the chair of the community that build succession and voicing our strong opposition to the state, creating a taking away municipal zoning autonomy from the cities and towns. And copy that to the city. State house delegation. Thank you for articulating federal funds. Okay. Is that motion by councilor? Will check by councilor. Any discussion on that?

Is to continue item CC to the next meeting on a correspondence agenda for that meeting. Is that accurate? It is accurate. Okay. Any discussion on that motion? Character finally item D, Mister President, item Double D is a communication from Lexis Galileo, Department of Transportation MMC, city clerk response. We got a Newport Avenue on Thomas street traffic light. And again, this was to be placed back on the docket from October 11, 2023. The reason why I put it back on the docket is because the response we got from the state was dated October 2 of 2023 in response to the initial letter that I sent them. Having them look at the intersection, I'll be put out on the street because of the traffic congestion that's out of control. The only response we got was that email from Lexis Galveo back on October 2, and we haven't received anything else since that time. So we're talking about six and a half, almost seven months, and we have got no response whatsoever from DoT. So I'm not impressed at all with what's going on. I want a more definitive response, something ASAP from the state. I did speak with the mayor directly. We had his first mayor's night out meeting a few weeks ago at british school in my district, and I know a few, a few constituents have discussed the issues with traffic in that area, with the mayor, and came over. We had a nice short conversation. He had mentioned to me at that meeting that he would definitely have somebody from his office look into it directly with DOT. So I also want to follow up with that. I mean, public safety is the issue here, and it's nothing, no less than public safety and protecting the people in that area. So again, traffic's not a control at the intersection. Not sure if they can do any of the signalization over there. Maybe they have to add another lane. I don't know. And then you have the side streets in the back, the boundary, Rubia's, Deming, Cedar Brook, Gary, those streets also. And that's another issue, because the city, our city, in contact with public works, was waiting to hear back from the state first about the intersection signalization before they went into the back of the neighborhood there and tried to work on some, maybe some signage over the streets over there. So everything has been held up from DoT. It, quote, s taken way too long. Ridiculous. So what I'd like to do is, number one, is I'd like to have communication sent back to DoT. One of the main contact is over there requesting a follow up as soon as possible to what they really haven't done since October. I'd like a cc of that to go to the administration as well as Chris Crawley and DPW. So that's one motion I'm not sure who the main contact is. I don't know if you do that and then you like that correspondence copy to the administration and DMW and DBW. Same as corresponding? Yeah. Same cars allowance. That's my first that the council send a letter to Dot asking for a better response and more thorough response regarding lethal atom and cloud street traffic light signaling process, that is. Any discussion on sending that all in favor? Yeah, 2nd. 2nd motion will be a direct communication to the mayor's office. Just confirmed the discussion we had a few weeks ago at the mayor's night out. I just want to get a status of where the administration is as far as reaching out to dot on their own, as was mentioned to me by the mayor directly in the conversation we had two weeks ago. So I wanted to see what they have found out, if they did, the maid of contact with Dot. If not, they could do that as soon as possible. And I would like a response to that at the next. For the next council meeting that we send a lever as well regarding this matter to the mayor's office asking if we've had an opportunity to reach out to Dot as they have indicated they were going to. And if so, the status of that we'd like to answer by the next meeting. Any discussion on that motion? All in favor, before we move? Yeah. Okay, we'll go to BB and then before we move on to items. And so I just wanted to invite the members of the public. Oops, sorry. So once again, we have put together as a council a resolution in opposition to. And I just wanted to invite the members of the public. They're holding a community meeting by Rivka here at the Pacific Library on Thursday, April 18, from five to seven. So if anyone feels like we should be a part of it, please support. That was the 18th. That is the 18th. Thank you. And Rick, could you see if perhaps we can get that notice put up on the website? We'll take a motion very quickly. I don't expect to take any motions or any actions on anything, but when council Moran is talking about public safety, there's a couple of public safety issues that have come up recently. We've got some feedback on both of those issues and committee meetings earlier tonight. So in as brief as possible, if you fill us in on the railroad tracks, industrial highway tower accidents and all the rest. And then very briefly, just two days ago, we had a animal hoarding on Senec street. And I think council had. Councillor has a little bit of an update for the city on that matter.

Through his handful control. But again, no action. As very brief, as brief as possible. Updates. Council regent fern. Yes. So councillor Miles has reached out to Department of railroad and they are looking to get some grant funding and it's probably going to take probably a year or so. So. And to address issues such as what we have in our city, it's not guaranteed to walk. So we need a resolution or what have you to help them excavate on their end. In the meantime, they're going to reach out to the director, Chris Browley, to talk about, you know, anything that needs to be addressed right away. They take a look in the city and, you know, see anything that's really. Since that needs to be taken care of by the interim. I also spoke to Costco Miles and asked them to have further discussion regarding lighting and striping, what have you, for the issues that we have. In fact, from my understanding, House of Iowa said that it was. They were responsive. He got a meeting with them through Zoom. Within a week, he spoke with their general manager. So we are hopeful that, you know, once this meeting happens between them and this representative and Chris Crowley, that they can address some of the real significant issues right away. Looking in totality looking at some grant funding that they're going after. And so hopefully they can take care of the tracks and look at some of the inactive tracks that they have there as well. It's all part of their plan. Yeah, it's like anything else, Grant funding that if they got to apply for a full pay, they would get it. But at least there was some kind. They were responsive. Now, Councillor Males, I know. If you want to add to that, that was the perfect summary. I only came up just in case you had any questions. I'll ask one question. I'm not even going to make a motion yet. We just see if Director Foley could also talk to me. I think any swiping on a roadway will have to go through that as well. Yeah, I'll make sure I do that. Okay. Could I just ask one question? Is it striking on the roadway or is it striking on the curb right now there's white striping that's supposed to rest. If we put striping on the curbing versus the roadway again, it retreats, dot the state. Old growth. So they have to make that determination. But we don't have the authority to make them do anything. I'm just asking if we should include the curbing in the conversation versus it just being Chris. Talk about dot about anything they suggest the rations, folks driving on. I will, I will. And I'm one of those folks who get I every single day. So I do have a driven officer. No, I haven't. And the only thing I will say, I'll just echo what conference. I'm really amazed at the response I dealt with conferencing in the past, and it hasn't always been so easy to get their attention. These folks answered their phones and promised me if I knew respond ASAP. I'm pleased with that. That's good. We appreciate you doing that. We appreciate council for bringing it up to you. Thank you, councillor, president. And just an update, brief update from tonight's shelter. I want to thank Lieutenant Skagan and the staff over there. We all know the conditions that they were put into this week. 46 dogs picked up. And I want to also thank Hirsch Kirsten for the adjustments that he's making to the website. I think there's a lot of improvements going on there. The one thing I also want to echo is my thanks to the community. I've gotten more phone calls about people asking how they can turn around and donate or volunteer at the university shelter. It's appreciated. The only thing I would ask at this point, when I talk to Lieutenant Skagen, him and the staff over there are going to need a couple of weeks to process. Councillor Marshall and I were talking about this earlier. One dog was mad. It's so bad that they had to turn around, sedate him just so that they could clip him. So some of these animals need extensive evaluation, so please give them the time that they need to go through the evaluation. And I'm sure that the dogs will end up, they're working with the SPCA, so we don't know I'm going to end up with all of the dogs, but they're trying to do the rest. Apn I would just ask for the public, patients and that. I'd also like to thank former counselor Melissa de Robler. She reached out today and asked if there was anything that she could do. Again, the response from the public has been greatly appreciated. The people in the, the city love their animals and want to make sure that they're taken care of. So I want to thank people related to Molly Field in the conversion efforts. Notice the major violation. We can't. So you'd like to amend the agenda to the purpose of setting up? Yes, Frank is here. This is in relation to the fact that the resolution very categorically specific, the no version application. We're not going to address something that's not on our agenda. If the revolution were on the agenda, yes. But it's not. We're not going far and sealed to make motions on things that are not on our agenda.

Again, the response from the public has been greatly appreciated. The people in the, the city love their animals and want to make sure that they're taken care of. So I want to thank people related to Molly Field in the conversion efforts. Notice the major violation. We can't. So you'd like to amend the agenda to the purpose of setting up? Yes, Frank is here. This is in relation to the fact that the resolution very categorically specific, the no version application. We're not going to address something that's not on our agenda. If the revolution were on the agenda, yes. But it's not. We're not going far and sealed to make motions on things that are not on our agenda. It's just the motion for a while. And again, we're not allowed to do that. And I believe that's been denied in the past, so I don't want to keep it. Any question, are we done? We are now on to item three. Oh, I'm sorry. We're going to motion from council Moran, second by councilor Khadia, that we recess momentarily. The other city council meetings will revisit and reopen the board of license commission. We're back in as the board of license commission. As council. Thank you. Thank you for indulging and giving me the opportunity to speak to Kara Shrumbling, who's the president of happy hour club. It was fruitful, basically having to say that we don't need to have a hearing that an offer was made which has been accepted by license holders. So we'll be hearing recommending a 250,000. Finding posed. This came about based on conversations that I had earlier with councilor Milan and so formally, Kentucky is prepared to book one, which was the failure to appear. Actually reached out to council during the last hearing and recognizing that she should have been here apologizing for not being. But what is being led to tonight is basically the entirety of count two and count three. So in essence, the license folder is admitting that on January 27, February 22, and March 17 of 2024, she allowed employees to continue to remain in the licensed premises well after the 130 timeframe. According to the rule, at 130, everyone, including employees, are supposed to vacate no licensed premises. Two of the three occasions it was close to 02:00 and there were still employees cleaning up. One, it was as late as 323. I had a long discussion with Miss Trembley about that. She clearly understands today what the rule suggests and what she needs to make sure she does in the future. And she can certainly speak to that issue herself. And as far as concrete is concerned, which was the February 16 violation, entertainment without license, this was basically allowing dj perform on that particular date was probably state. She didn't realize or recognize that she needed a license to have that the city equated that to pay. And so I informed her that she should speak to the city clerk's office to figure that out, what she needs to do in the future and what she should be applying for. So with that said, before the council makes a motion, the recommendation. Miss Tremblay is here to speak and answer any questions that people. Yes, mister Trembley, please. Got that. Where do we have that? 68 Slade street, carrying father. Hold on. Just being a formal hearing. Is it ey or a y? Ay. Erase. Rate him. I, Karen, strongly swear that all the testimony you shall give shall be the truth, the old truth, nothing but the truth to help you guys. Are you all set now? And explicit understanding that no one's attainment and then everyone is out of. Yeah, I was just a little confused as the violin. I played music, cars on Saturday, sweating and thinking more of, like, fans and stuff. I know I can't have that. So things are a little more clear now. Do you. Are you still starting running the operation as we speak? Yes. Will you be doing that in the foreseeable future, as far as you know? Yes. Okay. Just only because I. And I say this, you know, I have somebody in the district in front of me with a license holder when there's an issue, you don't want to come back. I always say that it's not a threat, making a statement. You just don't want to come back here in front of me, in front of the rest of the board, because then certainly that means you've done something wrong for a second time. Could mean additional fines and potentially suspension of days and not being able to run the business. So again, you just want to understand what the laws are, you know, operate your business within that and just, you know, again, we're business friendly. The license commission's not only to be successful, but again, the rules and regulations you have to adhere to. I want to make sure you're doing that. So you definitely understand that, correct? Yes. All right. I don't have any other questions. I don't think you heard the solicitor lay out the agreement that you apparently have agreed to. Is that accurate in your opinion on what you describe? Yes. Mistakenly didn't come to the last meeting, but trying to get a hold of council while he was. He didn't see it. Well, I actually. I mean, I saw it during the after license. I kind of turned into a talk. Thank you for letting me come back. Any other questions? In that case, I'm going to clear the public. I'm sorry. The formal hearing closed and I left the motion. I wrote it down. Yeah, I'm just going to, I mean, agree with. We discussed it. Frank and I talked about it earlier, assuming the license holder was going to attend this evening. So being at first offense, and again, I believe the license holder understands, I don't have a problem making a motion that we assess a fine, 250 hours. And then I guess that would be paid?

And the city will count one, which is the failure to appear in count two, is for three separate incidents of allowing employees to be at the establishment after the 130. And count three was to allow live entertainment without a license, even over the DJ. And we're now clear on that. And that would be a $250 fine. 30 days.

The ordinance committee returns the following ordinance with a recommendation for approval in ordinance an amendment of article 23 of the Code of Ordinances of the city Department of 1996 entitled Public Art Fund. This is being recommended for approval from the Audits Committee for course of passage. Removed by councilor. Councilor brand. Second by council, the electorate committee returns the following audits with the recommendation for approval amendment. Article 23 of the total ordinances of the city of the 1996 the most was the first passage on the whole globe. I believe we have two folks from planning here, right? Rob Runge and Governor Kelsey. Are you both here? You're here on this matter? I am still. Right. Would you mind either both. I sat through the ordinance committee meeting last two weeks ago and I used it as chair, and councilor Moran is now currently chair. Okay. Did I just ask you public in couple specific things? I wasn't a big fan of the speedy component of it first time around, so I get why we might be doing what we're doing, but for those who weren't at the community meeting didn't have gone out of committee two years ago, three years ago, I just found out a couple of things that we heard in a couple comments. Why a public art fund in public art, maybe in a public art bond? Is it that the case? Is there two separate ones there? There will be. Going forward? There will be. We'll have two. That is separate responsibilities. That is correct. There was a discussion about private developers who acquiesce their hand holding state and city, or they contain it themselves, and there's a suggestion that why would they turn it over to the city? Is that a concern? A valid concern? I guess what I'm asking is, are you guys fully even? Haven't heard a meeting yesterday. Are you still always informed of this? Are there anything that needs to be tweaked or tweaking or are you styled? No, we're still ready to. Procedurally, no. I mean, you pretty much asked all the questions.

That you know, that maybe not all of our concerns have been taken care of, or at least you feel. I don't know how you respond to that. Like, as far as her concerns, what do you think about some of her concerns, which the president just alluded to, what you had sent on, the concern that she had. We have had the meeting with Joan, and we did listen to all concerns. We're still ready to move forward to make the public art fund and then a public art committee. Any other questions? Jocelyn, I apologize. Sorry that I wasn't at that last moment. The briefly, the public arts fund would deal with the 1% that come from developers. The public art committee would be a committee separate to deal with public art throughout the city, but no more than that, necessarily. The public art fund would just deal with money from developers that would be separate from. If the public per committee had another project or dealt with all the public perk that's in the city. Is there anything that prevents the current committee from being able to get it? No, we're trying to separate those. Why? So that the public art fund would deal with the money separately from the regular public fund. But I understand the distinction. I'm just talking about why can't the company do that, that you need the suffering committee to do? And if I could jump in. Are you looking for different types of people to be on, say, the ox fund committee? You know what I'm saying? It would be different. There are different mandated composition of the two of the two committees. There would be. The public art fund would deal with money that's coming in to a public art fund, where they would only meet when there's money in the public art fund, where the public art committee would meet more on a regular basis. They would also deal with all the public art throughout the city and also handle any, like, murals or any utility boxes that we do throughout the city. Would those two committees interact with each other? Big one possibility. And when you just mentioned. When you just mentioned the materials and the other public eye, that's mostly funded through grants or some other type of funding, right? That is correct. And they would. They would in turn. That committee would in turn, control that. That money. That is correct. They would deal with all the grants and the other funding committee to deal solely with the one on seven. That is correct. Private development. Is there a different composition mandated for that second committee, somebody with a financial background or just to keep the two seven? There are certain people to be on committees. I'm sorry. I understand what their intents are. I just. I'm not clear on why it was pushed forward. I still don't understand it. I'm sorry. Why separating them was kind of like the action plan, other than. I mean, I understand they're going there completely, two different committees. I understand they're going have different duties. But what, why, what's the reasoning behind it? Okay, aspect, same sort of question. Is it because we are mandating private development to give us that 1% versus the other grant funding? Is that it's fair? That is correct. And so what? Has anything changed? Has anything changed? Right. So before it was a certain way, it was both in one and now it's two separate funds. What made you make that decision? I think part of that decision was made because no money has been put into that fund since it was passed in 2017. The public Art Fund, which is the public art fund committee, the one that we're separating the changes. So is there going to be any intent with separating it moving forward? Is there an objective to it? Is her way of response for it? There is. I've been working with Cameron Bennett, who's in the planning department, to put it on the developer applications. I've also worked with Bob Ernest to put it on the other developer applications that he handles through the collections. So we're trying to figure out how to put money into the fund in a different way. I guess my other question is, is it taking away from any public bar initiatives? Not that I see. Separating both of them. Correct. If I may, is it more of a concentrated and conservative effort to get the 1% by having a separate committee to get the funding done from the developers? So this really, that's the focal point of that separation. And again, yes. So this way we can, if no one's been coming to say what, since 2017? That's right. So now with having this separated, there's going to be bonus on the developers because now you have a concentrated committee. Yes. And it's also now on the developer applications. I'm still. I see what you're doing. You're finding a way to make sure the money comes into the application and what have you.

It's less of just the enforcement part of it that's not being effectuated, but developing these forms that they can do thing the body will definitely commit and we just give it back to me. Which you think is yellow. Yes, we think it's a better approach to have them separated. I think it is a much better era to have them separated office it so many times for the purpose of doing that for the city. You already have another people that would be on the fund committee. Are they going to have more specialty in that trying to get the 1%, you know what I'm saying? Like there'd be more of a. I know it's going to be more of an emphasis, or their emphasis only, but is there more of a background for those people that are going to be on that committee which hasn't been developed yet, like I'm just trying to. No, both of the requirements for the committees are almost the same. That being our professionals, people from the community and engineers, people who care about the city, want to see the arts move forward. No, it seems to me that's being done. Except for. Unless you think it's too much for one committee to handle, I guess. Or do you think it's more efficient that way? I think it's easier to handle with the two different, other than the lack of utility or redundancy. Is there a reason not to do one more comment? Last question. Yes. Was there a question for the suggestion? I think I would suggest that we continue this motion psychopath or Gregor to reconnect through ordinance. Do I have a second? Send it back before the review. Do I have a second coming? I still. Why don't we take it in a second and we'll have a hold on. So that motion was by Councilor Gregor, seconded by Councilor Rubio. Any discussion on the motion to leave convict in that case? Clerk? Yes, it's a leap. President Mercer? No. Martin Rugio? No. Doctor Poder? No. Doctor Gregor? Yes Doctor Moreno. No Doctor Moreno. Doctor Rubio? Yes. Doctor Wilderheim. Two to six. Yeah. Well, the motion would be to prove the audience no. The move by councilor, second by councilor could be that a rule will be given to the honor amendment of our efforts 23 of the court of law. This is city 2nd 1996. Inside of public this would be the first act about a rule called counselor. Yes, in accordance with Councillor Greger's motion, this is going to come back to us in two weeks anyways for a second 2nd approval. So if there is any information that kind of clarifies the situation, I would just ask that it be brought up then so that we can address it when it comes time to hold on second approval. You're absolutely right. This would be first passage still gets two weeks for you to consider what you've been asked tonight and see if there might be a better mouse trap out there not fully committed to deal with that. But it does give every two weeks. That's how to digest and remove it. Well, in that case, this is the first passage on a low pole. It was intimate for the audience committee get some more feedback. And now we're on to a little forward. A yes quote is the first passage. President Mercer? Yes. Doctor Rugo. Yes. Councilor Corder? Yes. Councilor Greger? No. Council Moran? Yes. Council Moreno? Yes. Doctor Rubio. So here's a question. Could I say yes? No, I can't get more information. There may be more. That's. We still get more information after. That's the second right. Thanks.

The amendment would be to eliminate the new pay rates, 21 x. That has a range between 85 and 100. 1022 x, that has a range from 95 to 120. And then secondly, to change the pay rate for the new human resource position to. From 22 x to an x 22. That is the motion that I'll be making. Yes. This is an amendment rules committee. Correct.

The motion is to take up an item like Rubio and councilor. So we are probably on the floor. Okay. I'm going to ask that we amend this ordinance repealing replacing schedule paperings classified non union position sections 88, city of Kentucky. And number one. The amendment would be to eliminate the new pay rates, 21 x. That has a range between 85 and 100. 1022 x, that has a range from 95 to 120. And then secondly, to change the pay rate for the new human resource position to. From 22 x to an x 22. That is the motion that I'll be making. Yes. This is an amendment rules committee. Correct. A little bit of background. Let me get a. The motion by Councillor Wilson. Second by Councilor Moran. Is to amend the original item. An ordinance appealing and replacement schedule of a rate classified non position. Eight week twelve. Add director of human resources. Delete consolidated directory resources. The amendment is number one to eliminate uk rate 21 x, which is 85,000 to 110,022 x 95,000. 120,000. Change pay rate new director of human resources position from a 22 x to an x 22. Correct? That is the motion. That is the motion to make. Correct. Okay. Any discussion on the amendment? No. Okay. After having discussion with Richard Colt and the council, Milos and also Keenan, the acting director. There's. There's an interest to get this position built. And the administration felt like creating tuna pay scales within the 40 hours ranks. They could accomplish this, but under different set of different pay scales, it already exists. So the biggest thing is that we're changing from the consolidated director of human resources, which the administration tried to put in years ago, try and do schools, a collaborative thing with the schools that went by the wayside. And we're going back to the point of a director of human resources. After some discussion with Councillor Milos, director Holt, it was indicated to me that in order to accomplish that in a certain role, my role as chairman of finance, I didn't want to expand on the. On the pay rates for the papers, the pay rate guidelines that we have. So. And I also believe that it belongs in a direct spot, but that would require a city charter change. So I welcome that kind of discussion down the road. But their interest right now is to solely get a replacement for the human resource director that left, what, a month ago for somebody. So there is an interest. While the interim human resource director is doing a capable job, he still has other duties and just wants to turn around and get us on a sound pudding. And I appreciate that, but this will allow that to happen. Trust about appetite. And your original intent to go over to the CPA plan with the quiet truck. Correct. Everybody get that? Okay, so in one of the. One other point that I'd like to make moving into the z page, I think puts it in line with other directors, I found out that this position, the human resource position, falls under the director of finance. That's one of the reasons why the charge change is probably required. But also, like everything else that we do around here, some things haven't been adjusted in 20 to 40 years, and the chart is specified in a certain way. So it's just something that we need to have a fresh look of eyes on, especially with the human resource director and the amount of responsibility they are given now for following federal and state guidelines. It's just a lot more responsibility that I believe warrants us taking. Maybe personnel matters just to hold something that if we are going to come in with charter review commission, they take that absolute under their belt. Okay, so the amendment is as stated. Any more discussion on the amendment? That is all in favor of the amendment. What is the difference in resources? Hopefully speak. Sorry for both city and school tends to work in Solomon. That's why we're consolidating. The school department has stuck with their own higher income. Let's go back to 2012. 1112 15. Somewhere back in 2012, it was created because they had some efficiencies in sustaining, like having an HR person or personnel direct city and schools. The school was like the idea at first and didn't like it anymore. It's no longer consolidated. So title change mainly. Mainly a title change, correct? Yes. Yes. It's the leading record consolidated. If you replacing it with that answer your question. So now we are all favor of the amendment. I'm sorry, Rob. Roll call. President Mercer. Yes. Counter Rougeau. Yes. Councilor Gregor? Yes. Council Morens. Yes. Councilor Moreno? Councilor Rubio. Council Wilderness. Yes. Eight to zero now. Motion from council will remain second by councilman. Council Rubio.

Mister president, I will ask that the council adjourn in memory of Mister Harper. Cliff, many folks know offered good Congress council in the city hall of Famer. He moved here over 50 years ago from New York. He's been married to Marian, which most people don't also know for 60 years. He's a member of the Temple Emmanuel and fathers for many many years. He has two sons and two daughter in laws and six grandchildren. He's served on numerous courts and commissioners throughout the city. He strong advocates for the arts and went his way for those construction advocates for the option for each and every community. Always very supportive and I'll say what I said, I don't do much on social media but I posted something about there was something happening, positive happening in the city of Kentucky. Arthur put him involved in it or he was there to support it. And I believe everybody who has ever known this man is a better person for it. He's an icon in this city significantly, you know, missed by the public quite, you know, obviously his family misses him, the light of the world with his passing. The city of Pawtucket is better off for all the contributions he has made throughout the years. And so brain, we decided to move to Pawtucket in New York and he's made our city better in so, so many ways. Maybe best in peace. Just like that. Well stated and also couldn't say any better than you just did. Just want to add in a couple of things. I mean the thing about Arthur Flint, I mean you saw him at so many events, I couldn't have considered him like the face of the talking or the picture of the tucket. The other thing too that struck me not so much in a comical sense, but the fact that if you saw in his email he was King Arthur and in a sense he kind of represented royalty, some of the royalty in talking. He is going to be savvy this. I mean they were married for 60 years. Mary was a wonderful person. He was a wonderful man. And joining my prayers and condolences brought to Miriam and the rest of their family. Love him so. But again, I consider him wanting to play with him. You benefited district five. Yes, I had the honor the other day to turn on go to the week and express condolences. The entire council on the president nursery as well and so on. I thank misses split for his contribution, but not only his, but her contributions. They did so much as a couple for the city of Kentucky and it's really nice and fun, appreciated again, I had the honor to serve this author on the pension board for the fire and police. And he had a keen knowledge of investment. The way he would talk, the actuaries and everything else. It was enjoyable to watch him. They talked about things that are far over my head, but it was again, he was a benefit and an asset to the city. And welcome. I have the privilege to meet Mister Oliver and I have very good memories. But you walk around their house. The first time I met them, I remember I was walking in the neighborhood and then I come to the door. He invited me in and asked me if I needed water because it was a hot summer. And after that I became friends with them. And I had also the honor to meet their grandkids. And it is amazing how they raise older kids and he will be missed. I don't know if I can say it anymore. As well as John Peruja did all the key aspects and everybody else take away anything, it's. The couple moved here 50 years ago and immediately became smart.com. it was there adopted home. They did everything they could. Four buckets. Both wound up being bucket hall of Famers.
