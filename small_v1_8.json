Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the March 4, 2024 meeting of the Borough Council Metuchen. Adequate notice of this meeting has been given in accordance with the Open Public Meetings act. Pursuant to public law in 1975, chapter 231. Said notice was published in the Home News Tribune on December 19, 2023, posted in Borough hall and on file in the clerk's office. All requirements of the Open Public Meetings act have been satisfied. Please join me for the flag salute. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Roll call, please. Miss Zupan. Councilmember Branch. Councilmember Jamboy. Here. Councilmember Hyman. Here. Councilmember Jethuani. Here. Councilmember Candel. Here. Council President Delia. Here. Mayor Bush. Thank you. Madam Clerk, do I have a motion to open the agenda session? I make a motion to open the agenda session. Like to make a motion? You have a motion? I'd like to ask for a second. I should say second. Okay. All those in favor? Aye. Is there anyone opposed to an agenda session here? Okay, agenda session is open. Anything for us, council president? Yes, Mary. I have two here. I'd like to add resolution 2024 108, which is authorizing an executive session to discuss matters involving attorney client privilege after the appointments item on the agenda, 2024 108. Yes, sir. Is there 2024 107? Mm hmm. Yes, the bill list. Got it. Oh, yes, I see that. I'm sorry. 2024 108. Are there others? Yes. And the second one is to add resolution 2024 109, which is resolution introducing and improving the special improvement District Metuchen downtown Alliance budget for 2024. And I'd like to add that to consent agenda. Please. Please. Okay, so 2024 109 is going to be part of the consent agenda because I'd like to act on that before we go into executive, if possible. Yes. So why don't we make that 108? I guess it doesn't matter because we're already skipping to go to the other part. So why don't you make 2024 109 will go into the agenda session. So when we ask to approve, it'll be 2024 94 to 2024 106 plus 2024 109, if that's okay with the council members. And then 108 will be the last thing we do, which is going to executive. So just as our director of communications is watching this meeting, I want to give you permission to go home because we won't have any action to take that will be necessary to record thereafter. Anything else? No, that's it. Okay, great. Make a motion to close the agenda session. There's been a motion. Is there a second? 2nd all those in favor? Aye. Okay. The agenda session is now closed and we are thrilled tonight to welcome our executive director of the Downtown Alliance. Dawn Mackey is here, joining us to provide us with the downtown alliance proposed 2024 budget. Good evening, mayor. Thank you, council members. Appreciate your time tonight. As you know, the last time I was here, I was newly employed and Metuchen had recently been nominated for the great American Main street award. And I am pleased to return tonight after having spent the last year working alongside many of you and working with you in Boston to bring home this esteemed award to our community. The merits of that award cannot be understated. We joined just two other New Jersey towns that have that honor. And since we've won the award, it has been a vessel in which to court other aspirational businesses. Most recently, we've added yesterday to the mix and we have others in line. And we have the coveted problem that we currently don't have enough storefronts to handle the businesses that want to be here. So I commend you for working in collaboration with the MDA this past decade. I hope you will agree that the value of this organization is indisputable and we serve to promote Metuchen as a desirable place to live, work and visit. And I also want to tonight come to you with our 2024 budget, in which you'll see the organization is not requesting additional funding from the borough, but we are asking for an increase from the special improvement district itself. Last year we came with a static budget. We didn't ask for an increase. This year we are fulfilling some of the original requirements of the organization, which was to add administrative help. This organization has run by one singular employee and an amazing group of volunteers. So our volunteers continue to be the lifeblood of this organization. But in order to be sustainable, we do have to add some administrative help. And we are asking for an increase of the SiD of $50,000 on top of a static budget from last year. We would hope that at this point, proof of concept, we most recently added another accolade to our cap in which Metuchen was named the best destination in New Jersey. So that's another thing that we can all be very proud of. And it was achieved in collaboration. And the work", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Metuchen Downtown Alliance", "insights": [{"observation": "The Downtown Alliance proposed budget includes no additional funding request from the borough, but requests an increase from the Special Improvement District itself.

So that's another thing that we can all be very proud of. And it was achieved in collaboration. And the work that the organization does ultimately ends up benefiting the borough and every homeowner by increased property values. And in turn, ends up increased revenue to the borough coffers. We had been very focused during the pandemic of working to preserve our businesses. And with all of those challenges came tremendous amount of grant funding. And thankfully, the pandemic is behind us. So are those big grant dollars. So that's the reason we come here today, so that we may continue to do the work that the district has come to expect, respect and continue to bring home the awards. Thank you very much. Thank you. Does anybody have any questions? Yeah, I just. I mean, I don't have as much of a question as I am. Just the value added piece here is just tremendous from my perspective. I mean, as the executive director described, the coveted problem of, you know, not enough storefronts for interested businesses is really relatable. And we've had many conversations about different businesses that are interested in coming here and, you know, where can we put them? This is something that when we originally had a discussion, well, before I was mayor and before, I think almost everyone except for councilmember John Boy was on this body, there was a meeting in this room that was, you know, filled to the brim. I remember standing along the wall right there because I had no seat and thinking about the controversy associated with the development of this organization and how far it has come and the concept of expanding its role. Originally, it was like, we need foot traffic. What does that mean? And then the original ideas of what that meant, but the eventual concept even of recruitment. I just want to say this to you, Miss Mackey, who we work very closely together, but one of the things I have found in your role is this incredible, you know, sort of agent. The way you see yourself almost as an agent from a touch in our downtown and the way you put us out there and the way that you speak to people about this town with the same passion that all of us do is really admirable, and it's inspiring. And it is helping our organization grow. It's also helping this borough grow because, as you said, these two are completely related. Thank you for everything that you're doing, and thank you for your volunteers and the extraordinary efforts that everybody, your board members put into this. This isn't easy. We say this in borough business in general, and I'm sure the MDA, getting people to roll in the same direction is something that we've done very well here at different levels. And we are extraordinarily appreciated. We appreciate the support. And I just want to say, as an outsider, I feel as though this is my second home now. And it really is remarkable with this. It's a very small organization. What they've been able to accomplish, again, in collaboration with the borough and the property owners, it's no small feat. And I think everybody should be very proud of the achievements this past seven years. So thank you. Any other comments for questions from the council? No? Okay, thank. Oh, sorry. Yes, councilmember, the additional 50,000, is that strictly for salary for a new administration? It's salary, and it's reinstituting the storefront grant program, which I believe was very instrumental in the revitalization. It was sorely missed by the businesses, and it's an incentive, and I firmly believe that when we support the businesses and restoring the outside of their stores, and I can tell you we have a few lined up and ready to go, that's a value not to just that property. That's a value to the block. It's a value to the district. Visitors notice. I remember when I was a visitor here, it was every season when I would come to the Sportsplex, I would take notice of the stores that were being renovated. And it's raising the bar for the district. There has been tremendous, tremendous investment in New bank, Atlantic Health Hatch, Meximoto. So people are really investing, and that leaves a couple of businesses behind. And it. It could be a little bit of a drag on the district. So I think that this is a really good investment and it will inspire more investment, believe it's going to come back to us tenfold. And can I do a follow up question? Yes. So the money then, that you're putting towards facades for grants, that's grant money that is coming out of the assessment. It's not coming from a place giving us a grant, correct. Well, there are multiple things that will happen. So the money that specifically councilwoman asked about would go into a storefront grant that the MDA would manage. It's a matching grant. So a property owner would have to match up to $5,000, what we could support in parallel. I'm always applying for grants, and you can't count on those as part of your budget. And that allows us to expand what we do in the district. We have some really exciting probable opportunities this year that I'll be pursuing.

Thank you very much, councilmember Kendall yes, thank you. So I have an unusually lengthy report tonight and I'm also reading out councilmember branch's reports. So you go. If you're watching this and you want to take this time to fix yourself a sandwich that long, like sandwich? Yeah, it could be. Wow. The touch and historic Preservation committee is planning to commemorate National Historic Preservation Month in May. During that month, the committee would like to showcase residents efforts to preserve and maintain their historic homes. We're encouraging residents to send the committee a photo of your older home and describe any work to fix up that home that you're proud of, whether that is a fix up project, painting or garden beautification. In recognition of how our older buildings add value to our community, the committee will be sharing the submissions on its municipal Facebook page during May. If you'd like to make a submission, please send them to me@tcandellattoucheon.com. dot for the pool registration information will be ready by the beginning of April. Pool management right now is working on preseason prep and coordinating facility improvements that will be ready for the upcoming season. I want to read out some information for the volunteer fire company, which had a very busy start to the year. There were nearly 100 calls in the month of, well, in the months of January and February. A structure fire at 03:00 p.m. on last Friday on High street presented unique challenges. It was a basement fire, which is historically one of the most favorite dangerous, not favorite dangerous, and crews have also responded to several calls for structural fire mutual aid in surrounding towns to assist with our rescue truck, ladder truck and engine. Progress is being made towards the construction of the new firehouse as the design phase is currently wrapping up. And we'd also like to congratulate the 2024 to 2026 crew of fire officers who were nominated and elected by their peers, which include four lieutenants, two captains, a deputy chief and the chief will serve the town and lead the department through the next two years. Okay, on to council member branches updates the Matouche and Arts Council met on February 26 and reviewed the commission chair training workshop.

And other than that, the fishing derby, bike rodeo and mayor's bike tour will be coming later in the spring, so keep a lookout for the information and that's all I have.

It looks like we're pushing it to May, but it is a go and we are meeting on Wednesday, this Wednesday, March 6 at 730 here at Borough Hall. Cares committee is working on has been working with Melissa on the letter invitation for breakfast that they will invite civic leaders from the area to meet together to exchange ideas and plan ways that they can work together to get the message out regarding opioid addiction and other addictions, health issues and drug avoidance. We continue to enjoy working with Brandon on getting our messaging out and sharing valuable information with our community. Small contingency working with sorry. We're also excited about co sponsoring the after the fire program with the fire department. The parade committee is meeting next oh, the cares committee. Next meeting is this Thursday at 715. The parade committee is working on getting people to register for the Memorial Day parade. Our theme this year is honor and remember we have sent out the poster information to the schools for the poster contest and we're in discussions about what talent we can invite to the parade to reflect that theme. And our next meeting at the parade next meeting is next Tuesday, March 12 at 715. Okay, thank you very much councilmember John Boy. Okay, so from the seniors, of course, membership is still ongoing and freedom of touch in residence, age 60 and over, stop by the center to get a tour of the facility and get signed up. In addition to daily fitness classes, ceramics and art classes, board and card games, this month we are starting a crochet club on Tuesday, the fifth and 12th at noon and then we'll meet every month. A fire safety seminar will be this Friday at 01:00 p.m. with Metuchen fire captain David Lathrum. And also, the monthly luncheon is Tuesday, March 19 with a spring is in the air theme and it's $15 for the lunch and you could sign up at the senior center. And also the free monthly health screening courtesy of Rutgers is Monday, March 25 between 11:00 a.m. and 01:00 p.m. also, the monthly movie is shown on Tuesday the 26th at 12:00 p.m. snacks are provided and the facility will be closed on Friday, March 29. So that's it for the seniors. Let's see, I have the environmental commission. We actually had a really great meeting. It was very long but very interesting. Ken Sammond from the Shaytree commission came and did a presentation on invasive plant species, and it was so interesting and engaging that I'd like to see if in a future council meeting maybe he could come in. It's about a ten minute presentation, see if he can come in and do a presentation. But it was very interesting. And then we had Peter Fairclough came as a guest and also did a presentation on the habitat restoration in the Galton remediation area. So basically he went to try to see the trees and shrubs that were planted a couple of years ago, how they were doing, and on which side, I guess, of the bank of where the little stream is. So that was also very interesting. Also, Joe Castronova, who was the artist for windows of understanding and made an art piece for the Barnes preserve, is interested in having a go native festival, and we're talking about native plants. So between having invasive plant species that Ken Salmon talked about, we had another gentleman interested in coming and discussing what do we plant instead? Of course you're going to plant native plants. So it was all very interesting and we had a great meeting also. What else do I have? Oh, tomorrow the Shay Tree commission will be meeting, and that's my report. Okay, excellent. I have no report. Tonight we're gonna move on to new business consent agenda. Council president. Thank you, mayor. I make a motion to approve the new business consent agenda. Resolution is 2024 94 to 2024 106 and 2024 109. Thanks. There's been a motion. Is there a second? 2nd all those in favor?

I did indicate that we would be taking into account some of the suggestions of the board as well as the public. So I think it would be more constructive if I had my witnesses present that, and then we can go to questions. So, are you planning on how many witnesses tonight? Three. So I think procedurally, Mister chairman, we had to witness. So we probably should do cross examination by. If Mister Wiley wants to, and if any members of the public want to before we. Yes, I agree. Procedurally, even if you don't, if you want to waive your cross examination, we were would then be at the point where if the public had any questions for that witness, I was willing to waive it because. Okay, so I think because there was an objecting planner, the public should have time to ask any questions as well. So I think we should stick with that. Yes. Peter Steck, the objective planner. I'm here for the evening. Now, because my other hearing got canceled, and because there is new direct testimony, I would like to potentially offer more testimony. And probably I should do that. Before I get Croix, I agree that that's problem and that's probably fair to everyone here. So if anyone from the public had any questions. Okay. I would also like to remind anyone out there, please speak into the microphone so that they can hear you. Thank you. Or you can use the microphone on the stand. Yes, please. Thank you. And I guess one further request to be, I suppose changes have been made. A lot of testimony has been given by your professionals so far and I guess any alterations that have been made, if one could stick to what the differences are to, you know, to be more. That was my attention, to show how these plans are different from what the board saw. So I would first like to call our architect forward. Thanks, John. Reminder that you're still under oath.

Good to see everybody again. Welcome back. Still valid? Still valid. Yes. Still accepted. Thank you. So just quickly, from the exterior perspective, the design of the building largely remains the same. However we did, we reduced the number of units from 23 to 20 units. We added about 1000 overall usable area of the building by removing the setback area on the proposed third floor and just squaring off the building. We previously had 21 bedroom apartments, market rate, a three bedroom and a two bedroom CoA. The three bedroom Coa and the two bedroom CoA are remaining. We have reduced the number of one bedroom apartments to seven and we've added ten studio apartments. The intention is for all the unit sizes to meet the minimum required square footage recommended by the ordinance. So on the first floor, we previously had one three bedroom co unit on this floor. It fit a little better to put a one bedroom and a studio on this floor. So on the lower section we have proposed one bedroom. This allowed us to get some windows providing natural light into the common living area. And the studio apartment worked well. Since it can only have windows facing Highland Avenue. We still kept sort of a small office in the back. We have a reduced little slightly reduced size amenity room still, and a bicycle storage roo", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Holly Road Associates", "insights": [{"observation": "Reduced the number of one-bedroom apartments to seven and added ten studio apartments, including a one-bedroom and a studio on the first floor with windows providing natural light into the common living area.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Maintained the three-bedroom and two-bedroom CoA units.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Reduced the number of units from 23 to 20.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}, {"observation": "Adequate notice of this meeting has been given in accordance with the Open Public Meeting Act.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Holly Road Associates", "insights": [{"observation": "Reduced the number of one-bedroom apartments to seven and added ten studio apartments, including a one-bedroom and a studio on the first floor with windows providing natural light into the common living area.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Maintained the three-bedroom and two-bedroom CoA units.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Reduced the number of units from 23 to 20.", "classification": "None", "sentiment": "None"}, {"observation": "Adequate notice of this meeting has been given in accordance with the Open Public Meeting Act.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 320, "chunk_end_time": 937394, "base_url": "https://fb.watch/sqe6R9HS7b/", "chunk_url": "https://fb.watch/sqe6R9HS7b/"}, {"start": 4000, "end": 10000, "text": "lding by removing the setback area on the proposed third floor and just squaring off the building.

We still kept sort of a small office in the back. We have a reduced little slightly reduced size amenity room still, and a bicycle storage room. And the elevator is slightly has been enlarged to be accessible. The first floor unit count, you know, has been changed. There's a studio apartment in the upper left hand corner. One bedroom. Another one bedroom here, the two bedroom coa. There's a two bedroom koa on this second floor, another studio apartment in the back and the studio in the front. And then on the second floor, we mixed in another combination of one bedrooms and studios. The proposed three bedroom co unit is on this floor, on this portion of the drawing, and on the third floor, similar. There's another mix of one bedroom studios and the last two bedroom CoA units on this floor. Mister Costenza pointed out in his memo that apartment 2d is slightly undersized at 497, which is an error on my part. Apartment two C is oversized at 562 for a studio. So I would just slide this demising wall slightly to the left, and then they'll all be conforming to the size requirements. And I believe that sums up the changes. So the changes made seem mostly in response to, I guess, direct comments given about the previous sizes of the overall units. So I guess primarily to address the unit sizes. Every unit now has a code closet. Every unit has a substantial storage closet, walk in closet accessible to the common areas. We went through and made sure they all had individual washer dryers, so there's plenty of storage in each unit. Was there anything done architecturally to address any of the concerns the board had made about the massing of the project? No. We're still holding the same proposal to maintain the aesthetic of the existing building. We feel it's familiar to the neighborhood. We'd like to avoid the shock of knocking down an existing building. So our intention was to extend and continue the aesthetic of sort of a. It's sort of a building that exists on the edge of the downtown district. And I know we made this. This argument before, so we feel that it should be sort of nondescript and sort of blend in and not sort of be a kind of a statement building. So that's our position at this time. And hasn't the massing actually increased with how you've changed that top floor? The volume of the building is larger, yes. Because we removed that setback on the third floor. That's correct. And the square footage is larger. About a thousand. A little over a thousand square feet larger, which we needed to make the unit sizes work. Any other questions? The roof now is flat. The roof is still flat, yes. We haven't increased the height, so we're still not requesting a height variance or a number of stories variance. And Nyd asked last time about a sun study. Any thought given there or. No, we don't have one. In your opinion, is this make for a worse situation or not? Well, you can see from these renderings. These are renderings of the existing. Well, there's photographs of the existing building on the top portion of the drawing. You know, one taken from each angle. So you can see when you're looking at the building on the upper right hand corner from Highland Avenue, it looks. Now it looks like a three story building. And the image below it is the rendering of what it would look like. And it does look like a four story building from this angle. And certainly the massing of the building gets a story higher. But you can see the roof line in the existing building. And now you see another ribbon of windows. So, you know, it's essentially the same aesthetic. And on the left side, it looks like a two story building from in the upper left hand image, because the property to the left is essentially a story higher than the front of the subject property. And then you could see the roof line in that photograph as well. And that roof line simply gets replaced by the third floor. Right. But if we consider that you've basically got a full story all around now at, you know, you look at the corners, one would have to think that you cast more shadow. I would agree. It'll cast more of a shadow because the eve line is higher and the sloped roof. And, of course, it goes back further. So it will cast more of a shadow. I would imagine, you know, in the summer months, around 304:00 it'll start to cast, you know, probably about halfway across the neighboring lot. In the winter months, it would be a deeper shadow because the sun angle is obviously lower. Any other questions for the architect? Not really a question, but just thinking at least that, you know, one of my primary concerns, echoed by the board, was that the three bedroom unit was down on that lowest level. There was no windows in the kitchen or common living area. I do see that's now moved to the top floor. And very smartly, you know, the office, utilities, storage and amenities were shoved into that corner where there is no windows. So I just want to at least. Thank you for that. Okay. Thank you. How many bicycles do you estimate you can fit in that? I think we can fit about ten in the storage room.

And then we intend to put individual hooks on the ceilings and each apartment for individual bikes. And the engineer has provided some bicycle storage outside of the building. I have a question now, looking at the plans just to confirm. It sounds like. I guess, although, like, the massing of the building is changed. If I'm reading this right, it's the exact same height. Yeah. The height hasn't changed. Yeah. I'm sorry, just to be clear, like, compared to the existing building, the height is five inches higher than the existing building. Existing building ridge is essentially five inches lower than the proposed flat roof. But it's a full story taller, correct? Yes. It's full story taller. Yes, it's a full story usable space. But compared to the pitched roof, now a flat roof, it may be only five inches taller, but it's still a lot more use. There's more volume, and we're obviously another floor of usable area. Correct. Sorry, Daniel, any other questions? Okay, I have one, if you don't mind. What was the purpose of the photograph? Those two photographs, one of them with a representation of the building on the left side there. What is that sheet? A two. I'm sorry, I don't understand the question. What was. Were you requested to take those photographs? No, I just wanted to show. I thought the planner had requested enough. I don't believe so. I think there were initially have a rendering from the other. From this image is shown on the left side at the last hearing. Yeah. So we just wanted to show that something to depict with those photographs just what the proposed building will look like and what the existing building looks like. Was it not to compare the size of that building to the residence, to the what? East? That wasn't the intention, but certainly that can be seen there. Okay. That's all I had. Okay. As I remember, I think last week it was brought up in the other planner's testimony that the photographs of the existing conditions were missing. Okay. And I think because it's pertinent, instead of. Sometimes we hold questions for witnesses until all of the witnesses have testified. I think because we're only talking about changes here. I'll say this to the public, those here in the public that may have a question about what was just spoken, not about what was spoken last month or commentary, but if there was changes about the unit types or the square footage or what you've just seen. If anybody has a question for the architect and would like to come up, if we could do that now, remind everybody this is not the time to make statements. These are questions of this witness, about what the witness. Witness testified to. Hi, Suzanne. Sia, 58 Robbins place CEA. Two questions about the changes. First, previously there was an office unit facing the front. And that would be. At least half of that would mean half of the units up front were in compliance with having no apartments on the first floor. Is. Sorry, I'll hold. Yeah, so previously, and definitely if you could speak into the microphone. Yeah, okay, I'm right up there now. And take it out of there. And, you know, wasn't working too well for me. Okay. Okay. You got my info? All right. The first question was around removing the office space from the front so that means that both units would be apartments, and you would need a variance for that, I'm assuming. Okay, the second question is around the elevator, since we had talked about that previously. Would there's. Would the elevator be the same size and layout, or would it be larger for ADA compliance? Okay, thank you. Anyone else from the public or the objectors attorney have any questions for this witness? Not, not at this time. Okay. Okay. Mister Wiley, I think we can now. Good evening. Les Walker, Meridian Engineering. I do, yeah, we're still in good standing, so my changes are simple. It was really just to show changes that would affect compliance with parking, and to call out the building areas per the architect's plan. On our second sheet, we call out, you know, each by each floor, how many square feet of building there is. And on our first sheet, we call out the parking calculations with the changes in number of units and unit size. Our required parking is 38, and our provided parking, including the EV parking credits, is now 38. So as the project currently stands, it no longer needs a parking variance. That's it. Okay, so you didn't change the design of the parking, you changed the calculation, just the calculation to demonstrate that now we're in compliance. Okay. Very straightforward testimony as well. That's it, yeah. Any questions for the engineer? Yes, Bob. Mister Walker, you did revise the drainage system, correct? We had submitted to your office before last meeting a concept for putting in a drywall in that back parking lot.

Well, you have to worry about if it's going to get clogged up and, you know, getting the water to it to begin with. We're going to switch to permeable pavement that keeps the water closer to its source and gives a, you know, a stone bed below the permeable pavement for the water to soak into the ground, as opposed to concentrating it into a system in the corner of the lot. So you're testifying that the areas currently shown as gravel would be changed to permeable paving? Permeable pavement. That's right. So it takes away some of the concerns about migration of gravel. How do you, how do you mark the spaces? Things like that. And permeable pavement is a green infrastructure technology that is recognized by NJDEP for stormwater. And we would be able to strike the pavement, is that correct? That's right. There won't be a concern over how do you know where to park. Right. Are you going to have a sweeping plan and backing up. Yeah. That's required to have an operation and maintenance manual that carries with the property. It gets filed with the deed and it's the responsibility of the owner and any subsequent owner of the maintenance, routine maintenance at different periods of the year. One final question about that. Will the applicant. This is not a requirement, but will the applicant be putting up signage saying that this, this is a permeable payment to discuss that it's what it's doing environmentally, it's often a benefit done by many owners who do this. If that was something of interest. I know, you know, a lot of times when there's a storm drain now it has a picture of a trout on it and says drains to the stream. You know, if there was interest in having some small sign or something to indicate that, just so that, you know, what you don't want is somebody changing their oil and just letting it go into the ground. That kind of, you know. So to be understanding of what the site is. Thank you. Yes. Mister Walker, we also discussed that you will do test pits and to determine seasonal high water table and you'll do permeability testing now at this point in time to design the system so that we know that it's going to sort of. The board members will know that we, both of us expect it to work. It's not going to be deferred to the resolution compliance stage of an application. Sure. Which is fine. Right. And we're also going to look at the flows that will reach the very end of in reach the very end of in place where you're now going to have a trench drain as a backup. Primarily, it will serve whatever comes down in place to it. But if a system, no matter what system we have in the parking lot, it will serve as a backup in the event that that system overflows. It's going to go into a trench drain at the very end in place. And then you have it piped underground to an inlet at the top of your parking lot alongside of the new addition. And it will drain overland from that point out of this inlet. It will bubble up out of that inlet and flow downhill to Highland Avenue, right? Yeah, kind of the same way it does now. Runs overland. There's a little bit of a crest on in place. So some of that roadway comes towards us. So to make sure that, I mean, the permeable pavement will reduce runoff further from the site and then to give a secondary bypass of any water that is coming in that direction to allow it to keep going overland to Highland Avenue. Right. And under the original proposal, the applicant was proposing to pipe all of the runoff that they collected from the gravel, which then proposes a gravel parking lot downhill through the parking lot that adjoins the building and discharges it into the gutter of Highland Avenue which our office and I consulted with Tom Harrits, the borough engineer, both objected to. So Mister Walker has agreed with his client to revise the plans, eliminate that situation. Their roof drains will discharge to the gutter of Highland Avenue, but the runoff from the in place and the parking lot will not be piped directly there. That's right, yeah. None of this is on the plans that are in front of the board, correct? Other than the correct, what they have on the plans that are before the board right now is still a gravel parking lot. And Mister Walker designed a recharge system that is essentially under the concrete pad where the park, the AdA and EV parking are in the rear parking lot. And he has an overflow channel from that system running perpendicular to the right of way and discharging onto the surface of in place. Then it flows into the trench drain at the end of in place through this same pipes, underground pipe system that bubbles up out of an inlet that is at top of the hill immediately adjoining the end of their proposed addition to the existing building and it then flows downhill to Highland Avenue. That's what's on the plans that are before the board tonight. I issued a supplemental memo today on the drainage system.

Mister Walker and I had a conversation discussing the different alternatives and we have mutually agreed that we believe a porous pavement system as we just described, is the best route to go to reduce runoff uniformly recharge it into the ground on the existing parking lot surface, into that ground where the runoff is being generated, which is a basic principle of today's stormwater management design. So the board has not seen the plans that show course pavement system with striping on them as of now. But the intent has been made in agreement with our engineer and I commend you. The site portion of this application has gotten better each month you guys came back. Thank you. And for the record, even without doing anything that this site does reduce impervious coverage. So there would be some small measure of reduced runoff, but this will make a significant difference. Anything else from the board? Before we open to the public, I have a question regarding parking. In other projects we've seen there was, and I don't know if this is for this gentleman or not, there have been proposals about loading zones directly in front of these buildings so that people can unload groceries or unload things. Do we have any idea if there's anything like that proposed? We're not proposing any on street parking or on street loading. You know that. I would think that that would be building management. My experience is that building management would schedule, like, move ins, move outs, so that you don't have a problem with several trucks out there at one time. But there's ample room right in front of the building. Our site is 95ft wide, so there's ample room in the front of the building for a truck. Thank you. Another question and I'm looking at the site plan. I'm trying to figure out how it would be possible. I'm thinking of human behavior. I'm pulling in my car into the lot that's adjacent to the building from Highland. And if there's no spots available, it looks very tight to make a U turn to get out. If you look up at the top next to the dumpster enclosure, there's a wide striped area. I do see that. Yeah. That's the intent of that isn't to comply with some kind of handicapping. It's just to give you a place that you can pull in and back, back out of there so it reserves a space for turnaround for just that purpose. Thank you. And then, and I don't know if you can answer this, but my, my concern is, is that, you know, in place does not connect with the parking lot adjacent to the building. So I'm pulling into the building. Oh, there's no spots. It's 06:00 p.m. i'm exhausted. I'm gonna have to do my u turn. I see the, the marked off area. Very considerate. I go down. I will not say that one way, one person will do it every time, but human behavior, I'm not gonna wait and turn onto Maine and sit in that traffic to go around. I'm going to go up Highland and then cut down Robins and then go onto in place. Is there any kind of consideration with either assigning spots so that people know, look, I either have my spot or I don't, or to prevent. Because what I don't want is for Robin's place to become, you know, like a cut through for the people that can't find parking. Yeah, I mean, certainly now with the permeable payment, we could certainly number the small spaces so that, so that. And, you know, mark some for visitors if that's what's, you know, desired. But then, then each tenant would know, you know, where, like where they should be. Parking? Because my concern is, you know, everyone's gonna get home after work and it's gonna be like, which spot is open? I'm trying to think of a way to prevent anybody from excessively going down. Robins, if possible. Sure. All right, thank you. Yeah, sure. It was my understanding that the tenants are going to be assigned a parking space number. They will be assigned a space. Well, that's, that's certainly a way to address the concern. Where should I park? Right, I thought that was previously testified to. Yeah. That correct? Yeah. Okay, so, but rather than needing, you know, a little, little sign at every one, now it'll be clear where you should be. Any other comments from the board? Okay, so at this time, if there's anybody, based on the limited testimony that Mister Walker just gave, if there's any questions for this witness, you could step up. Okay. Seeing none. Thank you. We can close this witness. Thank you. Mister Walker, Mister Wiley, it's all yours. Next witness is planner. Now, you've been previously sworn in at the last meeting and you still have your licenses, is that correct? That's correct, yes. You are still accepted. I understand I'm falling. Still under oath? Yeah. Just take your phone number for us. Mister Richards, for the record, Paul Rickey Ricci, licensed professional planner. All right, well, you observed these changes. How would that alter your required planning testimony? Sure. I mean, my testimony is going to be fairly brief. It's going to talk about the recent changes.

Okay, so at this time, if there's anybody, based on the limited testimony that Mister Walker just gave, if there's any questions for this witness, you could step up. Okay. Seeing none. Thank you. We can close this witness. Thank you. Mister Walker, Mister Wiley, it's all yours. Next witness is planner. Now, you've been previously sworn in at the last meeting and you still have your licenses, is that correct? That's correct, yes. You are still accepted. I understand I'm falling. Still under oath? Yeah. Just take your phone number for us. Mister Richards, for the record, Paul Rickey Ricci, licensed professional planner. All right, well, you observed these changes. How would that alter your required planning testimony? Sure. I mean, my testimony is going to be fairly brief. It's going to talk about the recent changes. And also I've been asked to discuss some other recent developments in the area, how this site compares to those. And I also just wanted to touch upon the buffer standards in the town, what your requirements are, what exists, and really how it technically changes. As part of this application. You heard from the previous witnesses the new design. The unit sizes will now, based on the testimony from the architecture, they'll be fully compliant. Parking is now fully compliant. Dwelling unit storage now is fully compliant. There was other concessions that the applicant made as part of the application. My notes suggest associated with streetlights working on intensity levels, foundation landscaping, street trees. And I know the stormwater is still being resolved, but the applicant is committed to all those changes. I will recognize that did come at the cost of some additional space and mass along the front of the building. Regarding. I previously spoke about the 22 27 Hillside development. First of all, this development just, we talk about number of units and the like, bringing that to an actual density so that we have something that we can compare apples to. Apples? Our lot. The combined area is 25,803. Reduction in the units from 23 to 20. That relates to a density of 33.76 units per acre. There's also the 390 office space that's proposed as well. So with the EV credit, there's 38 spaces and parking is clearly code compliant based on the testimony. The 22 27 hillside that we discussed at some length, that's located at the intersection of in place in Hillside Avenue. It's block 118, lots 1920 and 21. The resolution reflects lot 18.04 as well. That's the actually that small rectangular lot. I'm not sure if our site plan's up. That's located between our two tracks of the subject property that's used for residential parking purposes as well. The resolution reflects 19 units that I reviewed and 23,117 space, so that would be a density of 35.8 units per acre. So this project is slightly less on a density scale. That project also required a parking deviation to allow 34 parking spaces where 36 were required. I was also just for another project on Main Street. I was provided just to compare so you get a full flavor for a project on Main street as well. 410 Main street. That was a recent approval. It contained 15 units on a lot. That's 7931 sqft. That relates to 82.39 units per acre. In addition to 2560 commercial space there, one space was provided per residential unit parked across the street and no parking was provided for the commercial space. So at least in terms of recent activity nearby and approvals in the community, this would be the the least dense project with the most amount of parking in comparison, in terms of the unit sizes, 22 27 hillside, I didn't have floor plans, but the resolution did reflect a one bedroom unit that was 607 sqft in area where 850 sqft is required. So the board did find it appropriate to allow a smaller unit size there. Also 410 Main street. All 15 of the units were under the design standard criteria of the minimum size for the apartments. Regarding the buffer, I think it's important to recognize the standard and what your requirements are. It's 10ft for conditional uses and in this context that can include a dry cleaner, a hotel, a religious use or cannabis retailer. It's 5ft for permitted residential uses other than single and two family dwellings against the apartments are permitted on the upper floors. Permitted non residential uses. It's 10ft is required for eating and drinking establishments, indoor amusement businesses, retail shops, day care centers, brew pubs, etcetera. And then it has permitted light industrial uses. 25ft that's not in play. And then it says all non conforming uses as determined by the board. And I think your planner has called us a non conforming uses and has indicated that that buffer is subject to the board. I would just suggest that, you know, your code already identifies the uses that are being proposed here as either being required between five and 10ft. The existing setback of the building most proximate to the residential property is 3.3ft today. So in terms of going from or trans, how can I say this? Changing the use from the office in the building to residential under your code actually makes. While not compliant, it makes the buffer more compliant because it recognizes that residential uses are less intense than commercial uses in your buffering requirements. Can you read the five foot one again? Because I thought you said there was an exception. You gave me a ten foot for conditional. And then what was the five foot language? The five foot standards for permitted residential use is other than single or two family dwellings. So I think it's omitting. You wouldn't have to buffer, you know, a single family use in a, in a b zone to another single family use or two family use. But once you have something above two family, the buffer requirement would be triggered. Is my reading of that. Okay. Okay. And again, the parking lot in the rear that's existed per your resolution for, we know, approximately 50 years.

And again, the parking lot in the rear that's existed per your resolution for, we know, approximately 50 years. I saw that as an opportunity. It was classified as a d one variance. But the applicant is proposing now a buffer of 14ft to the east and 8ft to the south. So to the extent that that relates to your buffering requirements, that's largely consistent with what your zone anticipates. You can argue that the 8ft doesn't meet the 10ft standard. We are talking about 390 commercial space in no relation to that setback. And you know, this has been a commercial parking lot for some time. It's taking on commercial parking as its form. Is there anything else that I should discuss? Largely. Okay. When, when you compare this building specifically to 22 27 hillside, can you talk a little bit about the distance of that building from the next property over versus this one? Yeah, because I think that's a. That's something that everyone should know about. I ran some general on a GIS program before today, and I did go by the area again today before the hearing again, the in place, the building at the intersection of in place and Hillside Avenue, that side yards is less than 5ft from the roadway, feels right on the road, and the building across the street is located very close to in place. The closest parking associated that tandem parking up in place is located closer to the closest residential lot than we're proposing as part of this application, I'm talking structure to structure. That is, I saw that, that if you have a commercial parking lot existing for 50 years, and I look at it from the sense of if this application is denied, I have to ask this question. Are you suggesting that the office use no longer has the ability to utilize that parking area? So I saw this as an opportunity for improvement in betterment. If you ask me. Would I rather have, would I rather live at the house, block 118 eleven at the intersection of Hillside Avenue in places located right on a roadway where people are coming up and down? Or would I rather live next to a parking lot with fencing and landscaping surrounded it, where cars are moving at a lower speed? And it's been completely redesigned to meet established buffering controls? I would rather live next to the parking lot. Yeah, I mean, you're. That's not what I'm asking. What I'm asking is what is the distance of this proposed structure to the neighbor's house versus 22 27 hillside to the neighboring house across in place? Okay, let me just clarify. We're not talking about the parking lot. We're talking about the existing building itself. Yes. The building itself is 3.3ft from the property line. The existing in place building has a comparable setback to the in place roadway. But the roadway is in place and I think the cartwheel width was approximately 20ft or so. Yeah. So you're still not answering my question. The question is building to building. So structure to structure this. But estimate, what do you, what do you think from our subject building to the closest residential building compared to, I don't know, 15ft. Okay. 20ft. I don't know. Compared to the other property you were espousing about on the other end of in place. I didn't really look at that closely because the building exists. So I mean, I know there's an addition to the rear, but that addition is removed from the, those homes it's adjacent to. I was more concerned with it. I would be more concerned with a non residential use in such close proximity to a residential use of a building that exists. So it wasn't something I really factored in. Excuse me, Mister Wiley, I was just informed that microphone is not working. I apologize. I'm very sorry. We might as well get rid of it if it's not working. All right. If it's an important issue, we can certainly supply the board with that information. As to the exact measurement, I believe the question is from where our existing structure is proposed to the adjacent residential house. Compare that distance to the hillside building, to the nearest residence. Yeah. What I'm getting at is you're telling me why your proposed building is better. Our application is better from a parking perspective, from a unit sizing perspective. And I want to know why you think this is better from a, you know, where the. Where the structure is located versus the, you know, structures that are closest to it. My testimony for you, and it's unchanged, is whether you're talking about a five foot buffer or a ten foot buffer right under your code, commercial anticipates a ten foot buffer to a residential home. I think what's far more important is the transitionary land use in relation to that residential home. I would rather live next to this building with a residential structure rather than a bar in. That's three, four off the property lines, existing, nonconforming structure that exists. And this is a b one zone that anticipates a full range of more intense land uses.

We'll provide the numbers, but that's why I didn't focus on it, though. Okay. Thanks. Anything else from the board? I could probably provide some color on the distances, but they'll be approximate at best. Yeah, I was thinking of doing the same, but. Go for it. I haven't heard your voice in a while. Go for it. So we look at 25 Hillside Avenue, which is the former 23 25 27 duplex. Is that building in place has a three story massing element. And the distance between that building and the adjacent residence, which is 29 Hillside Avenue, is between 30 and 35ft. 30 35ft because it's an intervening street, a public right of way in place, 25ft wide, 20ft of which is improved. So keep that in mind. 30 to 35ft, three stories. The applicant is proposing a setback that's less than 15ft between buildings. Approximately could be 15ft. And the massing on Hillside Avenue, as proposed and revised plans is four stories. To me it's complete. Apples and oranges. Thank you. So Chris, the initial massing that you hit right at in place was it was specifically designed to be lower at three stories. Because it was a across. It was designed as three stories, basically maintaining what the structure was with the fourth story. Step back. Right. Which has been eliminated. Right. And I recall being a very responsive application. Anything else from the board? Okay. We've heard some new planning testimony. Are there any questions of this witness from anyone in the public? Okay. Hearing, none. We can close this witness? Yes. I guess the question is, is your case done? My case is done. Okay. Okay. So the applicant's case is finished. The applicant's case is considered complete. And before we proceed any further. We had kind of tabled the objecting planner. And now welcome the objecting attorney and objecting planner. Back up to the dais. Just for the record. Donovan Beezer. In the law offices of Donovan Beezer. On behalf of. Of the ejector, David. I'm sorry. Aiken. Welcome. Still accepted, still sworn in. Still has your license. Is still in effect. Continue to talk into the microphone, please. Thank you. I have a handout that may be of interest. Thank you. Thank you. I'll take that. Thank you. Thanks for not grabbing me. I'll describe what the handout is. And I'm going to refer to it in my testimony. This is dated March 12. And it consists of six pages, p one through p six. In the upper right hand side. And I'll just briefly talk about it. First page emphasizes the difference in expanding the building. From the initial submission on the bottom till the top. The applicant keeps on referring to the height of the building by the ridge. Which is in the middle of the building. And that kind of ignores the fact that the volume is being expanded significantly. We seem to be ignoring the fact that there is a three story new addition on the rear. That is substantial. And there is another story on the top. While the ridgeline is going to be approximately the same. To the side of the ridge line. There's a huge volume being increased. The second page is. And you kind of already seen this. The top is a photograph that I took on December 9 of last year. And I compare in the lower part two renditions. Showing that. You can argue about definitions. But this seems to me like a four story building. From what at least at the front was a three story building. There's kind of discrepancies in the plans. The architect keeps on referring to the bottom as a basement. So the applicant is proposing two apartments and an office in the basement. According to the architect. The engineer on his plan says that the existing building is three stories. And the proposed building is three stories. That doesn't make any sense. We're adding the story to that. The next page suggests that there is some inaccuracy. In the applicant's rendition. On the left hand side I show the existing and proposed perspective from Highland. And again, my client is on the left and you can see on the left hand side that the existing edge of the facade kind of intersects with the porch, the first floor porch roof of my client's property. And on the right hand side, when a story is added, it doesn't seem to get any higher. But the answer is it's 9.2ft higher. It's a whole story higher. So I would just raise the question of how can that be accurate, that there is no visual change. So I think that needs clarification. On p four, I simply note some of the changes in red. And again I mentioned that the engineer says the number of stories isn't changing from three to three, but that doesn't make any sense to, to me. And what's interesting is on the prior engineering plan the engineer said that on tract two, that's the one in the residential zone there was zero impervious coverage.

And what's interesting is on the prior engineering plan the engineer said that on tract two, that's the one in the residential zone there was zero impervious coverage. And as an existing condition and now this plan says there's 77% impervious coverage, existing things are changing uncomfortably here. On the next page I highlight the fact that in my opinion the application is going further afield from what the policies are. First of all, and the last one we had at least an office space in the front, remember? And you've got to have office spaces on the ground floor in the front. On this zone we had one apartment and one office. Now we have no offices at all. And where's the office? It's in a windowless room in the back of the building where no one can see it. And I would suggest to you that. What kind of office is that? I guess someone, maybe in an apartment can put a printer there or something. But that doesn't make it a mixed use building in my opinion. The applicant also referred to the amenity room. And the way it's drawn, there are going to be a few amenities because that room doesn't have any doors to it, so you can't get to the amenities. But that can be changed obviously by putting the door in the last page and I'll refer to it later, is we can argue definition of buildings, but anyone looking at this building is going to say that was a three story building and it's going to be a four story building. So if you just look at the height of buildings as a pedestrian would read them, you'll see in my diagram I labeled and read the number of stories that you see from different sides of the building. This is the only building that's going to have a four story facade. In my analysis area everything is mostly ones and twos and there are a few threes. And again, this municipality went through a lot of effort on the building at the corner of Inn that was referred to that was intentionally stepped down so it wasn't taller than three stories on any side. This one will be the only building in this area that has four stories from a practical point of view. So I'm just going to recast some of my testimony and then make some conclusions. Track two. In the residential zone there's no evidence to make it a commercial parking lot. You need a d variance. This has always been in a residential zone. The master plan said it was always going to be in a residential zone. It was informally used as a gravel parking lot for the office building. But there is no evidence that it was ever approved. And as I understand procedures in this variance proceeding, you can't punish the applicant for doing that. But you can't reward the applicant by saying that this lot, which shouldn't have any gravel or parking on it, track two. To say that that has an existing 77% impervious coverage. So I only have to handle a little more stormwater is crazy because it's not supposed to be there anyway. It's supposed to be a grass area. So don't punish the applicant for this history, but don't award the applicant a benefit. Assuming that that gravel is legally there and is impervious coverage. This application is kind of a moving target because we just found out tonight that the plans that I reviewed are wrong. Because now we have pervious pavement where it was going to be gravel. But clearly there have been big changes. The volume of the building has been expanded and has been expanded at the most visible part on Highland. The applicant says we now have conforming parking. Wait a minute. You're not supposed to have parking on a lot that's distant from your subject property. It's supposed to be on the subject property. So the applicant says, now we have conforming property. But the answer is you're supposed to have 38 parking spaces and there are only twelve on the subject property where the parking is supposed to be. If you take advantage of the credit in your business district again, you can reduce the parking by one half. What a great reduction. You're required to have 19 spaces. How many do we have in the lot? Twelve. We still don't need it. Your code clearly wants the parking to be on site. From a practical point of view, it doesn't want a parking lot as a principal use on tract two. The area hasn't changed much since the last hearing, but I refer to the last page of my exhibit to look at what other buildings are.

The area hasn't changed much since the last hearing, but I refer to the last page of my exhibit to look at what other buildings are. While this is not a transition lot, this is a lot at the edge of the business district, where the next property over is a residential zone and a residential house and the property behind, informally used for parking. But it's a residential zone. Usually when you think about transition, you want some kind of an average. You know, you're kind of ratcheting down from four stories to three stories to two stories. Here we have a three story building. That's unusual in the area. And what's the transition response? I'm going to add another story to it and put it in the front. That's not a transition. As I said last time, that's like putting, you know, Mount Everest between two peaks and the Adirondacks. That's getting bigger and bigger. It is not in any way a transition. The master plan has always wanted track two to be residential. The zoning ordinance has always said that it should be residential if you calculate the density on tract one, because that's where it's supposed to be. This is 66 dwelling units per acre. The applicant likes to add in the square footage of track two, but that's in a different zone, and it doesn't even touch this property. That's not how you work on density, in my opinion. So let me just repeat what I think is the relief that's needed. You're supposed to have commercial use on the ground floor. The applicants started out with one office, and now we have zero offices. And I'll grant you this is a through lot. So technically, the residential use toward in place is supposed to also be commercial. That might be understandable, but the important part of this property is on Highland. That's how people see this. So that's a d one variance. I would suggest to you, because your definition of stories says part of a building that any way you look at it, this is a four story building. That's what the pedestrian would read. If you asked anybody who was still breathing how many stories in this building, they would say four. The other way to look at it is the applicant is putting apartments in an office in the basement. Is that the kind of thing that your ordinance was intending to do? So and there's supposed to be a buffer. When you have a one or two family home, there's supposed to be at least a five foot buffer. And that is, let's say, from a multifamily building. Well, it's very apparent this building is being extended, expanded to the rear in a massive way. There's a whole new story on top, and it's supposed to be proportional to the parking on the site. I would suggest to you if the applicant didn't expand the building, converted it to residential use or put some offices in the front, it would probably be proportionate to the lot that it's on. But what's happening now, since we're expanding it to the rear, there's an ability to turn around in the back of the lot. Now you have lost that just for a delivery vehicle and everything else. You've lost the ability to turn around in the back, especially like a trash truck where you know where the lot isn't full yet. This is a steep lot. I think the percentage slope is 10%. So it's not a great place to park. And now you're making it harder because it's a dead end aisle. Yes, there's a small spot to turn around in by the trash now, but that's not going to let a delivery vehicle turn around, in my opinion. So the biggest problem, in my opinion, is the use of tract two for a non permitted principal use. Track two is in a residential zone. Everyone says the zoning ordinance and the master plan said it should be residential. There's a chance that it could be used for residential because it's not really developed. And what you're doing by approving this application is saying, for the rest of our lifetimes, this is going to be a parking use which is not a permitted use in that zone. That, in my opinion, substantially impairs the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance. If the applicant converts the building to whatever. And I know there's talk about, oh, we could put in a restaurant or whatever. Well, the answer is you got to have the right balance of parking to the building and we cut you a break. You only have to have half the amount of required parking, but they still can't meet it. So how would you allow them to add a new story and expand the building to the rear to make it worse? That certifies that that rear parking lot is forever going to be something other than what the ordinance wanted. So in my opinion, the changes that were introduced, although not complete because we have mystery engineering now based on conversations, no new plans, but they're going in the wrong direction. Direction. The building volume is increasing. There is now no commercial use on the first floor. And we're more making more formal. This non permitted use on track two so, in my judgment, the applicant has not met the strenuous burden of the Medici case. Which applies both to the non commercial use, to the front, as well as to track two. How is track two particularly suited for a parking lot? It's a great place to have one or two houses. There's not a lot of traffic on that street. Because it's a dead end street in. I don't think the applicant has demonstrated that that's particularly suited. And again, I don't want to punish the applicant for past use. But I don't want to award the applicant. I think that's improper. So I don't think the applicant has met the burden of proof. If this is approved, in my opinion. There will be substantial impairment to the zone plan in zoning ordinance. And because of the now constrained parking lot on site, I think there is substantial detriment to the public good. Thank you, Mister chairman. Does the board have any questions for our planner?

I have a different question, which is. Did we. Did you mark any exhibits last meeting? I believe we marked my handout at that time. Probably zero one. I'm kind of winging it, right? We did have a handout. Okay, so we should call this exhibit zero two then. Let's say we'll call it o two regardless. So I think the right way to do this would be Mister Wiley, if you want a cross examine. And then if anybody from the public has questions. So my first question is, it's been identified by the federal planner that the additional square footage. That the additional square footage footage is 1094 sqft. Do you dispute that number in floor area? No, but in volume. It doesn't really describe how much the building is expanding. I'm just asking yes or no question. Do you agree or disagree with 1090 4? Don't disagree with that. Do you disagree with the borough's ordinance, which establishes that what you're calling the ground level is actually, under the ordinance, a basement? I do not believe it's a basement because the definition of a story talks about part of a building. I don't think you necessarily measure a story by averaging the grade all around. And at the end of the day, these are either apartments in an office, in a basement, in a three story building. Or I guess at the end of the day, I'm reading this as a normal human would. It looks to me like a four story building. I think the story height is unclear the way the organization. But the board of adjustment is. That's to base it on an ordinance, correct? Yes. And that ordinance defines what you're calling the first floor is really a basement. It is unclear because the ordinance and the definition of a story talks about part of the building. And this front part of the building, without a doubt, is four stories. Are you suggesting that the board ignore the at least 50 years of history. In which this area, off of in place that is identified as parking. Has been utilized by the building that fronts on Highland Avenue? I don't understand your question. All right. There's been testimony by particularly the present owner of the property. That this, during the course of his ownership, has been used as a parking lot. In addition, he testified that the party that he bought from represented that it had always been used as a parking lot. The borough has been unable to identify when that commenced. So we have to accept that because we can't identify it. It's a d one. But you're proposing that the board ignore that history altogether and just. No, I just said don't punish the applicant. But the way I look at it is this was. If this was approved by the board of adjustment, would they have allowed an informal gravel parking lot? I would say no. I would say that I don't doubt the fact that it had been used that way. But as you know, that doesn't make it a legal, nonconforming use. And that is why we're asking for a d one. But should the board ignore the past history over the last 50 years of the fact that it was used as a parking lot? I think it can acknowledge that it was used that way. But again, I don't think you give the applicant a bonus. Because it was never authorized. Assuming that the existing use is 77% impervious. On track two is a bonus on your definition. If you're considering it a d one and it hasn't met its burden of a d one, then practically no use other than the residential use could be used for this area. Thereby putting the existing structure in limbo. The applicant took a gamble by not getting that parking lot approved. Legally, the applicant has to suffer with that. The applicant is not the owner of property. So the other party is going to suffer, under your definition, stands in the shoes of the owner. I'm assuming the applicant knew what was there when the applicant consulted for it. I have no further questions. I just witness at this time, would anybody in the public. Oh, yeah, the board is absolutely. Yeah. Sorry. We jumped right in. Sorry. So I was the one that brought up earlier about the side parking lot. That is actually affixed to this building. And I raised the question of where is someone supposed to turn around on the site plan. You know, there is a hatched area crossed off next to the trash area which also has a landscape bump out to make it look pretty. But for me to understand is there a set legal standard for what an area needs to be to turn something around? It's substandard the way it is now with 90 degree parking. You're supposed to to have a 24 foot backup aisle. And it's only 18ft. It is only 18ft. Now if the applicant. It's broken, but so am I. If the applicant didn't fill up the back of the building, you could first of all angle the spaces going up, let's say 60 degrees. And I think that would be very close to what the standard is. And then leave a turnaround area in the back. That makes sense to me, but that's foreclosed because the expansion of the building to the rear. Thank you. I just didn't know if there was a set.

And again, if you angled them, let's say 60 degrees, it'd be a lot easier to get in and you would have space in the back to turn around. Thank you. I have a question. On your p five exhibit, you make the statement, this is no longer a mixed use building. Why do you come to that conclusion? Would you ask that again? Sure. You say this is no longer a mixed use building. Okay. Yeah. Because the office space is no nonfunctional. It's 390 sqft. It has no windows. It has no outdoor exposure. So the purpose of an office is. Let me go to the extreme. Let's say if someone with a two bedroom apartment said, I'm going to use one of my bedrooms as an office, does that make this a mixed use building? No. And I think you have to evaluate the functionality of the space to call this a mixed use. A mixed use building is supposed to mean, okay, I have different peaks of parking. You know, during the working day, so people are there in the evening, the working day people leave and in the evening the residential people come. And there's kind of an overlap, which means you don't need as much parking. This office space results in the need for one parking space. And it's a nonfunctional space, in my opinion. In your opinion, just from your experience, are there like, are there minimum requirements to space or percentage or to make it an actual mixed building or. There's no minimum standard. But the common approach is that in a downtown area, the first floor is non residential. And second through floors 15 are residential. That's a mixed use building. Thank you. Following up on that, if this building were not classified as mixed use and was, like, purely residential, would that have other implications with regard to, you know, what's permitted without variances? It has implications in terms of the master plan. The master plan thought that mixed use buildings were good in the downtown. And what this functionally is, is putting an apartment building in the b one zone, not really a mixed use. And again, it's a non functional office. But if you put it in the front of the building, at least there would be some presence when someone was walking by in the street. And that was the intent of this, to have some pedestrian interest. There is zero interest. No one in their right mind is going to know that there's an office in this building. And who knows who's going to use it? Maybe one of the tenants will put a typewriter there. Then my other question is, I guess if this building were considered to be four stories, how would that impact the variances required? It would add another c variance because the height limit is three stories. If the board were to view the windowless office as a token gesture by the app. Sorry. If the board were to view the windowless office as a token gesture to change the application to a b conforming mixed use, and this was purely residential, there would be additional variances required. I'm not sure. Would you ask that one more time? Sorry. We have mixed use in the b zone with this application now because you're permitted to have apartments as part of your mixed use. Yes. So the only variance they're asking for regarding the apartments is the ground floor. Well, so if there was. If it was only apartment, would that, would that trigger additional variances? That should be considered trigger any variances, because the prime variance is you're supposed to have office on the ground floor. Floor, and there isn't any. That's the prime variance. Actually, the prime variance is that you're not supposed to have apartments on the ground first floor. But if that's what, that's the main variance. It's not that. It's not. They don't define it as a mixed use building. Whether this is a mixed use or not a mixed use building. The definition or what the variance is, is that apartments are not allowed on the first floor of any building in this district. That's what the variance is. So Mister Steck's point about the mixed use is illustrative, but it is not what the variance is. This could be all one use. Office use is the way it was. If it's a mixed use, you can't have apartments on the first floor. The only edge that the applicant has is that the master plan likes mixed uses. But in the eyes of the master plan, this is not a mixed use because you're supposed to have commercial on the ground floor facing the street. Okay, that answers my question.

Then the objector's attorney, then the applicant's attorney, and then we're done. And then the board will deliberate. Sure. That work for you? Yes. Thank you, mister board attorney. Okay, so with that, we will close the application portion with the slight modification of having the objector come back. And so at this time in the hearing, Bob just kind of said it previously, we opened up to the public for specific questions to the witnesses that were testifying at this point. And the objecting attorney will come later. We can now open it up to public commentary. So if you have a strong feeling one way or the other, or just want to say hello or get your name on record, you can, in an orderly fashion, step up. And you were definitely first. So come on down just to sort of lay out the rules. So we're going to have to get your full name, your address, and then you'll be sworn for everybody who wants to make a comment. Okay, so why don't you give us your name? And my name is Sandra Flight. I live at 194 Highland Avenue. That's f l I t e. Sondra is s o n d r a. You swear or affirm that the testimony that you were about to give will be the truth? Yes, I do. Witness been sworn, mister chairman? Yes. I'd like to say that I have lived at the top of Highland Avenue for 27 years, and over that time have had many opportunities to walk by the global insurance building. And it has been ugly for 27 years. And it's ugly because it projects too far toward the street and it huddles against its property line. Now, I know that this is water under the bridge. Neither the board made those decisions, nor the property owner. But now you are faced with an application that requires more of a variance toward the front, more of a variance toward the side, a new variance toward the back. Moreover, the roofline, which today more or less matches the two roof lines next door, will no longer match and will look entirely different. This is an obtrusive building. Now, in 1999, somebody on behalf of the borough wrote a revision to the housing plan element and said that the town needs more high density housing and it's going to be infill housing because everything's built up. But that the borough should be very wary of approving projects which detrimentally impact the established character of neighborhoods, especially if those projects have a need for multiple variances. Somebody 25 years ago foresaw that this could be a problem in many cases. Now, I understand that the property owner has a problem in marketing a building which is out of step with the economy. And I understand that this board may want to see it become a residential building, but I do not see that this board is in any way obligated to approve an expansion of this size with so many variances avenue. I would like to say that. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony that you're about to commence proceeding will be the truth? I do. Your witnesses sworn. Mister chairman, I was just going to say that I am actually a resident, a longtime resident of May. I am also a licensed landscape architect and planner. However, I am not presenting myself as an impartial expert here. I am not presenting myself as an expert at all, but rather as a concerned citizen. So a lot of what I am going to say has been already said. But I just want to reiterate a lot of it, this apartment building, and I would never call this a mixed use building. I think thats frankly laughable, is too large. It requires multiple variances beyond what can be accommodated on these two tracts.

Mister chairman, I was just going to say that I am actually a resident, a longtime resident of May. I am also a licensed landscape architect and planner. However, I am not presenting myself as an impartial expert here. I am not presenting myself as an expert at all, but rather as a concerned citizen. So a lot of what I am going to say has been already said. But I just want to reiterate a lot of it, this apartment building, and I would never call this a mixed use building. I think thats frankly laughable, is too large. It requires multiple variances beyond what can be accommodated on these two tracts. Zoning laws are there to protect the public interest and the applicant is disregarding them. There are two distinct tracts that do not abut tract. One on Highland cannot accommodate the proposed apartment building. The current building is 11,518 sqft. Today it is proposed to be 20,861, almost twice as large. The building would fill the entire length of the lot through the through lot to in place, leaving no room for any outdoor amenities, adequate circulation or in my estimation, most importantly, refuse collection. I would like to draw attention to the fact that again, this is an 18 foot backup aisle, it is 10ft or 10% rather, whereas in most cases 5% is the allowed maximum and ideally it is three to 4%. So we're talking about creating a very hazardous condition in my estimation, particularly when it comes to automobile circulation. What happens is because it's the parking space itself, which is 18ft is to the wall. So you also have a situation where you have today you have the concrete bumper blocks. What happens often, and many of us have experienced this, I'm sure is you pull up over a concrete bumper block, sometimes your undercarriage is hooked on there. So I notice many people do not pull the full width or full depth rather of the parking space. And then what you have is a lesser instead of 18ft you have 16 or 15ft. In that situation, in most cases on a 10% grade. I do not foresee most refuse trucks negotiating that. So I don't understand how refuse is really legitimately going to be collected. Is it going to be perhaps two smaller dumpsters that are wheeled to the street. You do often have that in an urban situation where there is no choice but to wheel the dumpster to the street. So I guess at 04:00 in the morning, you would have a truck pulling up and the dumpster could be wheeled down, hopefully not impacting on any of the traffic. That's the cars that are already there. That is, in my estimation, a hazardous situation. And further, I think that, as has been discussed already, the accessible parking is not where it should be. The accessible parking is on a different track. It is not near the front door. If you remove this addition at the rear, which has been called just a rectangle, it's quite a bit more than just a rectangle. If you were to remove that, you would have the opportunity to have circulation at the back. You could also provide additional parking at the back, including the accessible parking. You would have, you know, the opportunity to perhaps use that opportunity to create a different amenity space, possibly on track two. If, in fact, that were the decision were made to, you know, that we were stuck with that. What I would call and has been called a broken tooth in the residential setting, in the residential zone. So I think that the fact that this has been used as an illegal parking lot for many years is not, in my opinion anyway, a reason to impair the zoning plan by codifying that use. Cutting back on the addition would, as I already said, allow for more additional parking in the rear, including the accessible and including an opportunity to do refuse collection in a much more legitimate way. In a much more, you know, less hazardous way, frankly. And as has already been said, I also think that this is not a mixed use building. This commercial space of 390 back of the building without windows. I don't consider that any kind of a legitimate mixed use. And finally, and not least of which is my concern regarding the landscape, there is an ordinance requirement that a landscape architect design and sign the La plan. This plan has been signed by an engineer. And in my estimation, there are problems with this La plan. The proposed applicant is calling for emerald green arbovite, which is known well in the field to be deer candy. And as anyone who lives in this neighborhood knows, deer is a serious problem. That is the wrong plant for buffer planting. Calorie pair is also suggested. That is a plant that was seriously overplanted in the 1970s and eighties and was found to have serious structural damage during storms. It has a very weak branching structure, but more importantly, it actually has been found to be an invasive. And it self seeds and causes thickets of self seeded pear saplings that will form in areas. And finally, Boxwood, which is. And all of these plants are known to be inexpensive because they are. They have been found to be detrimental to use. So they're highly susceptible to blight. So beyond that, though, I think if we are stuck with this lot being used as parking, I think that the board, as has already been described by the applicant's planner, the opportunity is for at a non conforming use to provide a really substantial buffer so that we can have an actual substantial double row of evergreens.

On all sides where it's possible. So this would remove parking from that lot, no doubt. But I think that would bring the parking that would be available more to be in line with an appropriate scale for the apartment building. There would even be an opportunity for an amenity space possibly on that lot, on that track two lot. I believe strongly this project should be denied. It is poorly suited both on track one and track two. And the scale and intensity are too much. It would be detrimental to the surrounding properties and to the zone plan and zone ordinance. And just to follow up on what Mister Stack said, I do think that it is much more appropriate to talk about the density of what's happening here. Not as the applicant's planner stated, but that it would be on just this tract, which is not contiguous. And that would leave, you know, 20 units on 0.3 acres, which would be 66 dwelling units to the acre. That is too dense. That is too intense for this lot in this space, in this context. And context really matters. Thank you. Yeah, I mean, typically if there's an attorney, you would speak for him. But I guess I was gonna have him question me. Oh, sure. Question. You know what he's gonna say, so, sure, let's let him say it then. I think the. To facilitate this, let me swear in. First you have to identify yourself. My name is. My name is David Aiken. I live at 24 Highland. And I would like to provide you with my comments. Now we got to swear in. Okay, ready? You swear or affirm the testimony about the givenness proceeding will be the truth of nothing. I do. All right, witness has been sworn. I'm hoping this works. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Everybody's had an opportunity to look at the site. Is this coming up? Yeah. All right. So if I may see it coming. So, yes, there we are. And I did prepare comments, so that I could be organized and be sure to cover it all. I have a handout that I can provide to be provided if you need it, as this. Okay. My name is David Aitken with my wife Seema Botnager. I live at 24 Highland Avenue. This is a property that abuts both of the tracts and in fact it divides the tracks. It is the one piece of property that separates tract one from tract two. And because of that I feel obliged to give you my full and fair and truthful response to this. I'm a former international pharmaceutical executive and my wife is a tenured professor in the faculty of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. We have two children at Edgar School. We're invested in the community. We've lived here for over 18 years. And what I do want to start by saying is that we've witnessed and appreciate the rejuvenation of the downtown over the last 18 years. It's remarkable and we appreciate everything that's been done by the borough, by other organizations and individuals. So first of all, let me just tell you that my overall impression is the presence of this proposed building will have a substantial negative impact on my own property and the neighborhood in general. If I can. Here's my current backyard that you see now. We talked about deer eating the arborvitae. You'll see yes, our backyards do have deer, so that's a real risk. The property that's being proposed is 3ft four inches from my fence line. And if we want to get out the tape measure to know the distance between the buildings, there's 15ft between my home and the fence. So that makes 18ft four inches between the two buildings. Just to clarify that from my measurement, we will suddenly have eleven of 20 apartments overlooking our backyard. You recall this is our backyard. We see that this is going to not only reduce the light but also our privacy. And we'll have eleven apartments looking over our property and above our property into the windows of our first and second story of our building. This is going to be 129 foot long wall along the length of my 150 foot property. 10ft in the front, 10ft in the back. 130ft essentially is what I will have next door to me. It'll be three stories high against the level of my backyard. The facade is 50% higher than the current building. You heard how this is a hip roof and the peak is in the center? Well, the building's 44ft wide and we're talking about moving that the facade 22ft closer to the property line. So this is a substantial change as I said to me from our yard, this is a 50% increase in the heights of the building and it's going to have a negative impact on the value of my property. So I feel the same. That the building is the same height is misleading. From my point perspective, I shaded in an outline of where the building will be. This. So basically what I did is I continued across the. This is informal, you know, like, you look at, you do something, you get an expert to do this better. But continuing the peak line across and to the back where that building is going to be, the building will now fill the area that's shaded on this slide.

But continuing the peak line across and to the back where that building is going to be, the building will now fill the area that's shaded on this slide. There was some question about whether any light studies had been done. Well, no, there hasn't. But I took it upon myself to see how I would do this myself. This is not uncommon for the type of career I have to do this. Don't take me as an expert, but if you want to go to the National oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, you'll be able to find how high the sun will be on any day, at any time of the year for any location. If you put in the coordinates, then if you go to the US Department of agriculture and there are pages on managing shade, it'll explain to you a very simple trig formula on how you calculate a triangle. That triangle is l equals h over Tan A. So what I did is I looked at this and then I plugged in the coordinates to see when I would have shade in my yard. So according to my calculations, to be confirmed by experts is at 01:00 p.m. from October 29 until February 6, shade will be cast all the way across the 50ft of my yard. Well, because I have set in a length of 53ft, if you look at it at 04:00 p.m. when the sun comes down a little bit further from August 6 to May 10, the width of that shade cast on my yard is going to extend all the way across my yard from August 6 until May 10. So I am concerned of substantial impact on my property and my ability to grow plants and my ability to come home from work and relax and enjoy the backyard of my property. And I think it will also affect the desirability of my property for future use. Now, I've seen substantial reference to this being a buffer in the application. In fact, at least four times in the application and once in the narrative, we talk about this being a buffer. Well, when we look at a buffer, whether we look at it from a visual perspective, a use perspective, an activity perspective, how much it reduces noise, how much it blends or integrates the neighborhood. I want to be clear. This is a property from the back of the mayor's office building. This is what it looks like from the back of the main street buildings. There's a building as it exists now. The gap between this is substantial and if you look at it, I put in the dotted lines to represent the building fairly reasonably by estimate what the building will look like then. This is not a transition building. This is not a buffer. This is 130 foot long, 34 foot high wall separating my property from the downtown area. I don't need that, to be honest. If you look at. I just want to. I saw a lot of reference to 25 hillside as justification for why this building is going to be such a good buffer visually. Look at 25 hillside. There's no four foot, there's no four story facade. The building is set back. The current building is extraordinary plain. I think of it as slab sided, vinyl clad, super sized version of a 1960s office building. It really doesn't contribute to the neighborhood and this is looking at it as a gateway to the residential neighborhood. As you drive from downtown into the residential neighborhood, that is what you would be faced with. I heard a lot about how the traffic is going to be better and the parking is going to be better Sunday afternoon. As a comparison, the comp is 25 hillside, cars in the yard, people coming and going 24/7 intensity is not the same as an office space, so there's nobody in the backyard on weekends or in the evenings. The current property, last point I want to make is, as I said, these two lots are separated and my property abuts both tract one and tract two. Tract two is underdeveloped with no and in the proposal or the 1978 minutes from the planning board, the subdivision committee, the owner of the property stated that there were no plans to develop the property in any way. So that was memorialized then and I don't see how that impacts us now, except to ask for a clear d one variance for a residential property. It's only one ordinance in the master plan recommend single family use. If you grant the d one, you're authorizing parking as a principle of use on track two, and that precludes any future opportunity for that to be residential property. And I believe that that will clearly impair the attractiveness of my property and its value. And so, in conclusion, that's really all I wanted to say, except that while we want to have more commercial or, excuse me, residential space in the downtown area, it's not to the exclusion of our neighborhoods. And I hope the board takes that into consideration of plants and review and whether or not they approve it. Thank you, Mister Renaud. Do you want me to go now or wait until the public is finished? Wait until the public. Yes, sir. Thank you. Okay. Anyone else from the public want to make a statement about this application? Kendu villa, d u v I ll a. 33 Highland Avenue. May ask you to be sworn.

Wait until the public. Yes, sir. Thank you. Okay. Anyone else from the public want to make a statement about this application? Kendu villa, d u v I ll a. 33 Highland Avenue. May ask you to be sworn. Testimony that you're about to give Mister Sane will be the truth. I do. Witnesses swear. All right. Thank you. Yeah. So my wife and I live along with our two small children on 33 Highland, diagonally across the street from the property. I'm concerned about the numerous zoning variances that have been applied for. For the property. I think it was a mistake to grant several of them initially, and it's a mistake to grant them again today. Concerned primarily with the parking and the congestion in the area. The renters and their guests will very clearly be parking on the street. Anyone that knows that lives in the area knows that the permanent parking is not enforced on Highland Avenue. And I recommend that that full traffic study be conducted for this development. Highland Avenue is already an unsafe street. I do not feel comfortable allowing my children to play in the front yard due to the traffic. Cars are constantly turning around in various different driveways, and especially mine. Throughout the course of the day, street parking is very difficult to find. On weekdays, cars drive very fast down the street. There's very poor visibility. It's difficult for residents to back out of their driveways safely. Late in 23, a man was struck while walking in the middle of the street in front of my house. It's just generally not a safe area. And adding more apartments and more cars to the area, I think is the. The wrong decision. So I urge the zoning board to consider the safety and the property of the existing taxpayer citizens and deny the proposal. Any other statements from the public on this application? Okay. Seeing none, I think now would be the time for the objectors. Attorney general. Thank you, mister chairman. I want to thank the board and the applicant for the accommodations that you've afforded us. I appreciate that. I'm not going to reiterate the points that my client and our planner made because I've been watching and I know the board is listening. So we respect your time, and I'm not going to do that to you. If my client said a little bit more than was strictly necessary, it's only because this is a very emotional issue for him and his family. It's important to them. The one point I want to make is that is to correct something our planner stated several times. Our planner stated that the board cannot penalize the applicant for the track two parking use. And that's not the case. This is a quasi legal body, and so you're obligated to follow the law. I know this board wants to be fair. That's a good thing. But there is a doctrine in law called latches. L A c h E s. That essentially means you can't sit on your rights. So that if my brother complained about a sleeping bag that I took from. From him when we were five, he can't sue me for it now because he lost that ability. So you can't apply latches against the government except in very specific situations. So although this board might think it's unfair, if the board determines that after 50 years this parking lot has been misused because this board is part of the government, the government is allowed to catch somebody even 50 years after nonconforming use has been made. Or I would want to say an unlawful use. So although it is a tough, tough concept, the board can prevent this applicant from using track two in the manner it speaks of. And this is where I would join with our planner. That lot can be used for residential use. Again, I just wanted to say what I thought was strictly necessary. Thank you very much again for your accommodations that you've afforded to us. Thank you. Mister Chairman, Mister attorney. Okay, you're up. Just find a microphone that works. It's all yours. Well, the course of this application, I've been confronted with many old memories. When I first got involved in politics, there was an enormous controversy on Highland Avenue. And that controversy was that Mister Aiken's property is along with another party. They're originally owned by the Casas and the Essos. They were zoned for central business district. The neighbor, that was Mister Silberstein. One of the line moves back, at least to what we would now call the Ruger building, which is the property in question. Enormous controversy became a political issue. Ironically, Mister Silverstein, who was a republican counsel candidate, endorsed me because I thought the line for residences should move back to this building. So here we are today with some people saying, well, gee, I don't mind it being commercial, even though any rational person would want to try to restrict commercial uses from creeping up Highland Avenue. That's been some of the purposes here. And that's pretty much one of the arguments that was made on the hillside application, which, again, is not a mixed use, totally apartment building, no questions asked. So, you know, I really think there's two principles here and I'm going to suggest that the applicant is flexible about other issues. But the two issues that are important are one, this parking lot has got to be a parking lot that's attached to the use of the property on Highland Avenue. That's the way it's been used for as long as I can remember, which probably only goes back to 1969, even though I've been here far longer than 1969. And I think anybody that's traveled through the neig", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Not Specified", "insights": [{"observation": "Parking and the congestion in the area.

That's the way it's been used for as long as I can remember, which probably only goes back to 1969, even though I've been here far longer than 1969. And I think anybody that's traveled through the neighborhood had seen parked cars in this lot. Now, the fact that it may not go back, I mean, the structure was built at 69. So I can't say that it was a necessarily a parking lot before 69, but I could certainly say it's been a parking lot since 1969. So, you know, to make the use on Highland, whatever that might be, I really think we absolutely need this to be a parking lot. So on that level I don't want to negotiate on the other question, which is height, long block wall. There's been suggestions, I know early on about what is the public getting out of this in the sense that if it grants these variances there ought to be something that advances the general good. My client's more than willing to look at that again. His emphasis at this time was to try to solve the problem that the board seemed to have at the last meeting, which was, hey, there wasn't closet space, the units looked too small. How is storage going to be handled? And we addressed all those things now in addressing them. Was there 1000 sqft added to this third floor? Yes, there was board. I understand you could question that and say, well, that's really not worth it, but we'd even be willing to entertain other configurations, even, including maybe having frontage all the way through Highland Avenue. But what has kind of triggered this particular design, so you understand, is that you've got a checklist that is supposed to emphasize. It's called a green checklist because it's supposed to be very environmentally sensitive. Well, why one of the conditions of environment, keep the existing structures, don't create additional tear downs because that effect means you've got to put in more concrete, more siding, there's more consumption. So try to keep the existing structures. So we kept the existing structure and we spread it out. Now, you know, we'd be willing if that, you know, is a condition, maybe we can make it an l shape, maybe we can make it a square. I think these things are possible. Yeah. I don't want to interrupt your flow here. I will say that the application and what you presented is complete now. So we will be taking action on what you've presented to us. So midway through an application, I normally applaud the expressions of flexibility. And we'll get back together on this. But we did that twice already, so you'll be getting voted on what was presented, what the public spoke about. All right. Yes. And that concludes my remarks. Okay. I didn't mean again, I mean, basically, look, I made the offer, or doesn't want to accept the offer. I understand. Well, basically, I think, you know, I would rely on our planner. There's an existing building with existing density right to the roof of this. This does cut off commercial expansion further up Highland. I think that's obviously a tremendous benefit. I have a question, possibly mostly just historic from history thing. The anecdote you started with about the zone actually going further up Highland. Yes. Was that akin to the. I'm not aware of the zoning of where your office is, but you face Amboy Avenue. Correct. Was that. Is that similar zoning where they were assuming that professional offices would. No, no, this was a straight downtown zone. Okay. It was not. Even though the houses were pre existing. Correct. So the property owners perceived that, hey, I can get more money because it's a commercial use. That was the thinking in the seventies or late seventies. I don't think it ever came true, but that was the perception. So these two property owners thought they were losing value and they got very upset. So it's kind of ironic to see it that was more curiosity. I know feelings about main streets and how Matutin was doing and all. You know, it all changes over time. Correct, correct. But this was literally the. I think they called it b one at that time. And went all the way up to what I call the Silverstein property. But I think it's a grant property now. Okay. Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. You're welcome. Okay. Okay. Board. I generally try to always listen to the applicant and assume that the applicant has a good idea or whatever they want to do. And that their good idea will benefit the town in one or more ways. Starting there. And I started there with this application too. I thought, well, it looks kind of substantial, but let's listen. And I did listen to all the people speaking. I did read all the documents. And I think in my opinion, there's just too much to worry about here. The mixed use question, I think, is since there is no definition, perhaps it meets the letter of the law. But it certainly doesn't meet the spirit of the law. The massing is clearly massive. There's numerous parking issues. The parking lot attached to the building may not be big enough to allow proper turnarounds for larger vehicles, or even maybe cars, but certainly larger vehicles. I don't like the idea of the parking lot in back, even though it's been a parking lot since 1969 or thereabouts.

Any one thing that I'm concerned about with this application, I might be willing to have be overcome, go along with. But there's just too many things in my judgment about this that don't work. To me, it's death by a thousand cuts. Yeah. For me, it all boils down to the massing. You know, at this point, I can, I find the unit layout and sizing to be acceptable. The parking, I think when you hear my comment, it can sort of be dealt with, but the massing is just too extensive here. And I think you really need to give, if you're going to come back in front of us, you need to give some thought to what you're going to do on that fourth story, third story, whatever you want to call it. It's way too intrusive to the neighbors and the neighborhood. And I was on the board and approved the Hillside project. There was a lot of thoughtfulness there. And I'm not saying that has to look exactly like that, but I think there's more to take into consideration. And as far as that, specifically, the office on the first floor, I think, don't even bother calling it a mixed use. Get rid of that office unless one of the residents wants it. You know, we've approved first floor apartments before, you know, the hillside building as then we've approved it. I approved it. So I don't have an issue with that. But it all boils down to the massing and I think it's just too great. And, you know, this notion of we want to use the existing structure because we don't want to pour new concrete and all that. Let's face effects. This boils down to economics. You want to use the existing shell because that's sort of economically the best thing. And that's okay. I'm okay with that. But, you know, the reason for wanting to use a shell has nothing to do with pouring new concrete and things like that. So I'm a no as currently proposed. Any other comments? Yeah, I'll try to organize my thoughts. Hopefully this comes out coherent. He's fairly new to the board, so let's watch this play out. So I think the part that I don't have a problem with is like the apartment usage and that d variance. I think to me that makes sense. I think the part that I really struggle with is the other part with the usage of the second tract. My understanding of kind of the application is that the expansion of the building on the existing building is justified by the fact that the other lot can be used for parking. But to me that doesn't really make sense. Like, if I owned my neighbor next door's lot, I wouldn't be able to just clear it and then expand my house all the way, you know, almost to the rear property line. But so to me that doesn't seem, I guess, acceptable in this case with respect to the surrounding properties. I think that's probably my biggest concern. I also feel like for me, what's missing in the testimony and the narrative is why that second lot couldn't be used in line with the, you know, with its use according to zoning. I think it would be one thing if there was a clear argument that you couldn't build, you know, residential housing that's compliant on that lot. But to my knowledge, that wasn't really presented at all. I think if that were the case, then I think there could be an argument that there's a hardship that justifies expanding the existing building. But to me that wasn't really argued at all. And I think for that, those are my biggest issues with the application. I'm going to say I think you nailed it in that last comment. If this was a case of that second lot being completely unusable the way it was, regardless of the zone, then sure wouldn't continue the use. But without hearing any testimony about if that can be repurposed and used properly as r1, I have a problem with that. Also, I want to say I personally have no issue with these being apartments. I actually think that it is a good transition into that neighborhood. It is residential right next door. I do have a problem with the absolute massing. Standing on the sidewalk. I'm walking by. It's four stories tall. With this newest version that we saw tonight. I don't think that there's any debate on that. I'm looking at four sets of windows. I think the massing is too large. And I don't think it needs to go as far back as it currently does. And I think that there is a compromise here. But as it was presented, I'm also waiting on now other thoughts. I do know that back parking lot keeps coming up, and I agree there could have been more complete testimony about the usability of it, and it wasn't really talked about it. And this is in some ways my opinion, and maybe my opinion weighs a little more because I'm a professional architect and I walk my dog through there every day. But I think the viability to put single family homes back there, I think, may be challenged by where the adjacent proximity to overlooking all the asphalt parking lots.

And, you know, there is a chance that if you summed up all of the available land, because the lot next to it is also zoned that way, that you could make some kind of a quiet cul de sac or some kind of interest. But I think if there was marketability for that, I've seen a lot of worse pieces of property get bought up in town and houses be put up. I see that all the time. So I do think the objectors plan are making it seem like this was meant by the founding fathers of Metuchen Zoning, that this was always supposed to be r one. The reality is, the reason why nobody noticed that it had never been approved was because it's kind of a no man's land and it's been used for parking for over 50 years. So do I think that it could be a meaningful part of an approvable application? Yes, I think the didactic nature of saying that that is only r1 and considering it for anything else is maybe a step too far. But I think not treating it like it's a unique piece of property that needs to be adequately balanced and how it's laid out with buffers designed and ways to, you know, keep headlights from shining in everyone's backyards. Yeah, there was very little, you know, little of that done. Each application, it got somewhat a little better. Right. We're now talking about pervious pavement. The engineer is responsive to it, but perhaps it's too much parking. But that's only one part of what I think strikes me at this. We spoke a lot. I actually wasn't as concerned about the apartment unit layouts because I thought the marketplace, when they really took a look at that, it would probably straighten itself out. Right. But the comments were heard. The architect went back, made the apartment units better, more market in line with the market, but in doing so, didn't take into account any of the other commentary that was given to them about the massing, about how the other in place apartment had laboriously tried to design the first floor apartments so that they were appropriate for facing hillside, so that there was a give back. They have little front lawns. They have little you know, fenced in areas. This does nothing. This keeps the same, to be blunt, rather poorly designed front entrance. And puts apartment windows on either side right now and puts them all the way up the. With no special treatment for what it would actually mean to the people that now would have to live on the first floor of that. It's different living on the first floor. An apartment, in a commercial apartment. It just is, especially with those setbacks. One of the neighbors on Highland said they walk by it, and the reason it sticks out is because it is bigger and it's pulled all the way up. And that's existing condition. We can't do anything about that. Reusing the structure is probably appropriate. I'm an environmentalist. I agree with all of that. But not architecturally treating it so that it doesn't behave for the next 50 years in a somewhat subtler way, somewhat more contextual way that wasn't offered at all. And when we noted that it was somewhat of a homely building and the architect's response was to make more of it, the architect came back with even more of it. So it went. Last month's thing had this weird setback. And I actually almost applaud pulling the thing all the way up because it at least made me think, oh, it at least looks like more of the worst thing. The Victorians used to build cheap rooming houses that look like that. They were just. They looked like little flash cubes and they were lined with little. And that's what that kind of looked like to me. So I don't want to speak needlessly. I do want to put forth that I don't think any of the purposes of planning response. When it came to how you were responding to neighborhood character. How you were addressing anything in and around the buffer. You know, the pre existing awkward sighting of the building. Nothing was done to mitigate that or soften it against the street. I do think the. The ask is too big. And I don't see. I quite frankly don't see how the application could be made better at this point. Would someone like to make a motion on this? Let me ask a quick question. Sure. If for some reason we did vote on this as no, does the applicant have the ability to just reform and come back? Only because from an economic standpoint, I'm thinking of, you know, I don't think that this is a complete waste of time. I think this version. We're all feeling the same way. Possibly. But, you know, I just want to make sure, if we're saying no, is it a permanent no to this use or this, this applicant or this build? I'm trying to make sure I understand that part. It's a situation. It's a legal question. So. Thank you. So, as long as the application is not the same application, the applicant can come back with a different application. It would be up to the board.

One and three applicants are seeking preliminary and final major subdivision and waivers at all. Yes. Good evening. Stephen Tripp from the firm of Walenskulben and Spitzer. On behalf of the applicant or the applicants? Yes. This evening I'm here on behalf of Metuchen one, LLC is the owner of block 71370 two and Metuchin three is the owner of 71, lot 3701. And as the board knows, these two lots together comprise the amended Oakite site redevelopment area in its entirety. Basically, the redevelopment plan has five separate parcels, delineates five separate parcels with different uses permitted different standards applied to each one. The purpose of this subdivision is to subdivide the redevelopment area now into those five parcels to create a separate lot for each parcel. So you'll have, one parcel will have the daycare and the sportsplex. One parcel. One lot will have Starbucks. One lot will have the former bank, which was now approved for the retail cannabis, and then the other two lots, which are parcels B and D. One of them was approved for the senior for assisted living. That project is not going forward, and at this point, and that will be the subject of further approvals with parcel B. So B and D together will be developed, but they'll be separate lots. So you'll have five lots, and they all correspond to the. Generally to the parcel map in the redevelopment plan. All we're doing this evening is basically establishing lot lines. We have the reports. We have a few comments to respond to the reports, but basically it's just a subdivision. To create the lines. I'd like to have an engineer from Bowler. Now, the subdivision plat was done by control point Associates but in conjunction with Bowler, and since the bowler firm is much more familiar with the overall layout and what's on all the lots, I'm going to propose to have the engineer from Boehler talk about the subdivision. If there's any technical questions about the plat itself. I do have the person from control point here to answer any questions, but I think going to go forward with an engineer from Boehler explaining the lots. Please proceed. So why don't we. My first witness is James Houston. Going to swear you in, please. You swear or affirm that testimony that you're about to give in this proceeding will be the truth of nothing I do. And would you state your full name for us and spell your last? James R. Houston. That's h o u s t e n, junior. And Mister Houston, you are an engineer with Bowler?

Yes, I'm a licensed professional engineer, land surveyor, planner, certified municipal engineer, and certified floodplain manager. Can you give us a little bit of your experience? I hold a Bachelor of science in civil engineering from Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, 1973. I've been engaged and practicing in engineering, land development, surveying, planning, municipal engineering, until I left my first employee from 73 to 96 or, excuse me, 2000. Then I joined the firm of Boulder Engineering in the year 2000. In 2001, we were given the opportunity to become the city engineer for the city of railway, where I was the city engineer, engineering, excuse me, planning board engineer, zoning board engineer, and the redevelopment agency engineer for about 16 years. I'm still employed by them to this day. Very good. The board will accept Mister Houston as an expert witness. Thank you. So what I'd like you to do is with reference. This was submitted as with the site plan, with the subdivision application exhibit. This was the exhibit that was submitted in response to the completeness review. It shows the two existing lots and the five lot lines for the proposed parcels. I'm sorry, sir, could I get you just to speak into the microphone? We have to share. Thank you. Sorry. Yes, the parcel, which should be on screen behind. You know what? Pretend you're Frank Sinatra while he's dead. But you know. Take the microphone. There you go. So the exhibit, subdivision exhibit before you in red line shows the five parcels. A in the upper right hand corner, the b to the left, the lower right is parcel c. The left of that is d, and all the way to the far left is parcel e, which houses the sports flex and the daycare. To the left of that and the lower right and parcel c is the Starbucks under construction. And then parcel A in the top right is where the former Fulton bank exists. And B and D currently are undeveloped, correct? That's correct. Can you just explain the purpose of the subdivision? Well, the purpose, as the attorney indicated, is to create five tax lots, as indicated in the red lines to correspond with exhibit D in the redevelopment plan. It's simply that there is no proposed site development associated with the creation of these lots. And the total area to be dedicated as Greenway Avenue is 1.3 plus acres from Middlesex Avenue to the driveway that goes out to Durham Avenue. And that ultimately will be dedicated when the road is completed. That's correct. It's currently under construction. And again, just for the benefit of our viewers who are remote, as awkward as it might be, I encourage you to get as close to the microphone when you speak. Can you pull it out and just talk into it? Yeah, let me do that. There we go. Great idea. Thank you. Okay, so. Excuse me. The parcel a, that consists of about 0.6 acres. It corresponds, as I said, to parcel A on the redevelopment plan and on the exhibit on the screen. And as I said, it also has the vacant former Fulton bank. And it's also been approved for a cannabis retail facility by resolution adopted in January 4 of this year and currently in resolution compliance. Parcel B consists of about one and a half acres that corresponds to Parcel B of the redevelopment plan. It's a vacant lot approved for assisted living memory care facility. No present plans for development per approval, but approval has not yet been formally withdrawn. Parcel C, which is in the lower right that houses, excuse me, that's about three quarters of an acre. It's known as Parcel C. As I just said, it's approved for Starbucks, which is currently under construction. And as most of you have been passing by, if you have, you've seen that it's well underway. The building shell is up. It has not been glazed yet, but it is well underway. And Parcel D, to the left of that, behind the Starbucks, is 1.98 acres. And it's a vacant lot currently with no approvals. And the last parcel e is 4.8 acres. It's as shown on the redevelopment plan, parcel either. It contains two structures. The sportsplex facility, which was approved by resolution in 2009, and the daycare center is approved by resolution adopted on April 7, 2022, and is substantially completed. As I was out there today, it looks like it's ready to be open. And in terms of the lots that are being created, they all completely with the lot area dimensional requirements of the redevelopment plan. That is correct. As shown on the subdivision plat itself by control plane. And the lot lines that we are creating are not creating any additional variances or relief. That is correct. That is in addition to what was already granted in connection with the appropriate approvals for these individual lots. Is that correct? That's correct. Again, if you could like, point the microphone towards Mister Tripp. Should he speak? Okay, sorry about that. Maybe a lot to get to in the future, but for now, if you can't manage, we appreciate it. So that pretty much explains what we're here for before the board. We do have reports, largely just factual in nature, recounting what we're doing, but I'd like to. I can start. We can start with Mister Cosenza's plan. Review Comments Comment 8.1 asks that we discuss the status of the mid block connector roadway when it's anticipated it will be offered for dedication.

We can start with Mister Cosenza's plan. Review Comments Comment 8.1 asks that we discuss the status of the mid block connector roadway when it's anticipated it will be offered for dedication. I think there's two separate issues here. One is when the road will be passable and have a base course, and the separate issue of dedication. So I'd like Mister Houston to explain that. As I saw today, and I'm sure most of you have as well, they're well under construction for that roadway. As I was out there today, they're digging some twelve or 13ft to extend the sanitary sewer. And the owner expects to have that roadway with at least the base done by the end of April. It's been delayed because of weather, because of some soil conditions they had to remediate for compaction, but that's still his plan to be done by the end of April. And what are, in terms of what are the logistical issues that they're dealing with at this point? The soil remains moist. You have to replace it or dry it out. It's difficult. Mister Triptor, please, if you would remember to share that microphone. There's also sampling and testing, correct? In connection with the conditions of the soil. Yes. As you excavate, to put improvements in, you have to test the moisture content, which drives the compaction. So if it's too wet, you have to either replace it or dry it out, etcetera. It's a whole process. Your borough, engineers, people, inspectors are out there constantly testing it. So it takes time to do all that. So. And with the weather doesn't help. So now the separate issue is dedication. And can you explain that? Well, as in any public road that's being built and get to a point where what happened? Let's move the mouse. Thank you. There you go. Anyway, any public road that's being built, get to a point where you want to dedicate it to the municipality, if it's so deemed to be. And improvements sometimes can't be completed so that the project can move on because of things like weather and so forth, and also by adjoining lots that have to be developed where there's no approvals yet. So it's a fine line that you walk to get to a point where you can make it passable, make it usable, make it safe, so that it can be open for public use. But certain things like landscaping or sidewalks and others that are impacted by adjoining lots, development of those, or approval of those, have to be melded into the process. So basically, the dedication is going to happen when the road is completed. One of the things that. That we are going to wait for is the approvals on the lots B and D, because those are going to have curb cuts, grading and other things. So the idea would be to get the base course in, get the road functioning, and then once the road is completed, it would be dedicated. We don't have a definite date for dedication at this point, but as Mister astute indicated, we expect to have the road to be passable with a base course by the end of April. And that, of course, would include the curbs and drainage and sewer and so forth, everything under or alongside the road. Now, the other comment is, applicants provide testimony for the board's benefit, discussing the temporary gravel parking area will be affected by the application. Essentially, what's happening is the temporary, the 31 spaces that are in the gravel area that are subject to an easement for the benefit of Sportsplex and the daycare that were part of the daycare approval. Those spaces will remain, but once the subdivision occurs, they're going to be in parcel e. So the easement will be extinguished, but the spaces will remain to be used until such time as permanent parking area will be developed in that area, which will have to be approved. And that will happen when B and D come forward for additional approvals. Because the grading of that area, and I think Mister Astley could explain, is really going to drive the grading of that parking area ultimately. Is that correct? Yes. Right here, the grade is locked in where the temporary meets the existing car park in between the daycare and the Sportsplex. And it's tied in over here where Greenway Avenue connects, but where the inlet or the driveway into a facility here, which would have to have parking under that grade has to be fixed to establish what the ultimate grading of this parking formal parking area that's built in the future will be. Comment 8.3 in the report wants to summarize how the existing easements are going to be handled, and as we submitted with the application, we submitted an explanation which Mister Cosenza requested of the existing easements and proposed easements. What we have is an existing site triangle easement for the county that will remain. There was a proposed easement in connection with artists where they were going to have an easement for some of the spaces on parcel e because Artis is not going forward. That was never finalized, that easement was not recorded, and whatever is going to occur over there is obviously going to depend on what is approved, but that easement is not going to be finalized. As I explained earlier, the easement for the 31 spaces in the temporary area, that easement will be extinguished once the lot lines are created, but the spaces will remain.

And the only other easement is there's a six space easement required for Dasco, which is in the works now. It's part of Dasco's resolution compliance. There's a draft easement that was prepared which is being reviewed by Metuchen one and three, and that easement will be recorded, which will create these six spaces. Can you just clarify where those six spaces will be located? Okay. Yes. You swear or affirm that the testimony that you're about to give in this proceeding will be the truth? Nothing but the I do. Yep. Name Stewart and your position with the applicants? I am the managing partner, Matouche one. The managing partner, Matuchean three, since 1998. Can you answer the question as to where the space is for Dasgo, yes, I believe the planning board approval of the Dasco. We agree the six bases would be in that rear temporary parking area, which is parcelly. Yeah, those gravel spaces all exist now. They're in there. They were approved for employee parking, so not for customers. Those would be temporary spaces and then ultimately permanent spaces. Correct. Okay, thank you. Feel free to jump in, Mister Cassenza, if you'd like to make a comment. I suppose I just need to review the Daska resolution for some reason. I'm thinking it was going to be in the paved parking area in front of the sportsplex, basically taking the place of the seven or 17 spaces that artists was going to have him. That was not the intent. From what I understand, if you look at the transcript from that meeting, that hearing, we declined, because we're just. We were. We know when the peak periods of traffic are. And actually it was you, Mister Cassenza, who said, well, can you put them in the back then for employees only? And I said, yeah, well, I guess we'll have to look at that transcript. Any question? I'll review the resolution, but I would think it should be in a paved area, because I don't think that we should have the employees parking in a temporary parking area, which is mainly empty or should be empty most of the time. I don't strongly care, but that's where we ended up at the planning board hearing. But, you know, whatever, you're warned. It doesn't matter a lot. I think that area, wherever you're going to choose to pick. Yeah, I'm fine with that. I just. I'm concerned about the sports flex customers having ample parking. But we're not talking about 50 spaces, we're talking about six. Yeah, yeah. But to be fair to the desk go parking. I think that. Well, the problem is that it's employee parking, so they'll be there for six, 8 hours, 10 hours at a shift, whereas the sportsplex customer turns over every hour and 45 minutes. I don't have. Yeah, I don't have. I don't really truly don't have strong feelings about it there. If Daskow opens in May or June, then yes. So I think what Mister Mannix is saying is we're going to put them on e effectively at the very edge of the front edge of the lot, on the south edge of the lot area right there, because we'd rather put them on a paved section of the lot versus where else can you. Or on d as. As a temporary. And that would be like temporary gravel spaces. There's RCP on that section, but it'll be gone a couple of weeks. That's fine. That works. That works. I think that's it. Unless Mister Cosenza has any other comments, I just want to know for the record that the right of way that's proposed to be created is undersized in certain portions. While the ordinance does require 50ft under section 110 140, it is consistent with the redevelopment plan. So I don't believe we have to grant any variance released necessarily redone plans intended to supersede those requirements. Now moving to Mister Mannix's report, let's see. The first comment is just meats and pounds descriptions for review. That obviously would be a condition of of approval. Comment two talks about concrete curbing along the easterly side of the driveway, which is actually the portion of the roadway dedication that will ultimately be dedicated with no parking signs provided along both sides of the driveway. I'd like Mister Houston to address that into where. Sorry, we're talking about the driveway from Durham Avenue in to where the improvements for Greenway Avenue will meet. So along the easterly side or the upper side, the pavement currently has no curb and it was built and was approved and built that way so that road could sheet drain off into the adjacent railway railroad land where it always has. So that's the reason there's no kerb there. And it's my understanding that the applicant does not want to build kerb. I understand there was some discussion earlier before the meeting, but that's our position at this time. So we would like the applicant to approach the railroad attempt to obtain an approval to build a depressed curb for drainage purposes. So you're talking about a flush curb. Okay, so.

Earl wants any way to have been built stabilized between his base course, temporary striping, temporary traffic control built to tie into that drywall. They want that done as soon as possible. We're not going to accept dedication of Greenway Avenue or that driveways above driveways that the subdivisions until parcels B and D and whatever may be built partially on E or Jones D. There's a lot of unknowns yet and timing to worry about whether we can get approval. Mister. Okay, I don't mean to interrupt. I'm just getting word from our tv production crew that we need to use the microphones. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Hold it as close as humanly possible. It's going to take probably three years before we are accepting the dedication of the Greenway Avenue right away. Acceptance of the existence. So I think we have time to pursue an approval that will occur along these. And the only issue, of course, is what if we can't get that approval? I've had. Yeah. I've had a lot of experience over the years dealing with. Yeah. Dealing with the railroad. And it's always understand that this whole project has been poured for a good portion of this. Okay, that's fine. Bob, could you clarify for me or for us, just for the record, of what this. This curb issue? Because I haven't heard of it before. I would expect that a roadway will. We have. I was just going to say that I anticipated that there would be a road with a curb. So what's the problem? There is no curb on the east side of the existing sportsplex driveway. And the driveway is built right on the property. That was how it was approved. When the sportsplex was approved, it was approved with no curb so that there could be sheet flow into what? The trenches in the railroad right of way. So it was deliberately. It was approved and built that way. That's why we're discussing what to do with it fundamentally. I don't have a problem with what Mister Mannix and Mister Harritz are asking. The site plan approval for the sportsplex was approved with this road as it's configured, aligned, and approved by the engineers to be dedicated for future dedication. So it's built to the municipal spec. And as recently as three months ago, when the curb was put in on the west side of that road, the curbing curb. The curb spec for municipal road is different than the curb spec for the parking lot. And it was put in the concrete mixes, and it was put into that spec as well. So it meets all the site plan requirements for this portion of the road dedication. Because when this site plan was approved in 2011 for the Sportsplex or 2010, this was the plan approved for this future road dedication. I don't disagree with Mister Mannix that we can put in a a grade curb and channel all the water into concrete on that side. I don't have a problem with it at all because we will have people on site doing concrete work. This is not a big deal, but it's actually technically not the way our site plan is approved. My concern is not putting it in. My concern is conrail is a nightmare. The bureau hasn't had it dedicated yet. Right. I guess. I guess just to clarify, the roadway ultimately, well, the roadway is going to be your responsibility until such time as it's dedicated and accepted by the municipality. So you're going to have to deal not so much with the planning board as to the dedication, but with the municipality. I mean, if the municipal engineer is satisfied with it and the borough council satisfied with it, then I guess that's satisfactory. But it's a little bit of an unusual situation, because ordinarily you would be asking to put the roadway in. And in this case, I think it all started with the borough wanting the roadway in. So it's a little, you know, 15 years ago or whatever, when the sportsplex originally, the borough absolutely was opposed to the road, but I'm going back a little longer than 15 years. And then they decided a bypass to Central Avenue was essential and we should have a road. Right. And we were always kind of in vivid first part, but I know about the second part. So in any event, yes, you'll have to deal with the municipality with respect to the specs. And I suppose it's not a matter that the planning board needs to be concerned about. It's just to clarify for, I guess, for the board and the public, the roadway maintenance, etcetera, is going to be the applicant's responsibility until such time as it does get dedicated to the municipality. And the municipality won't accept it unless it meets the municipality specs. And I understand that the width is something that the municipality has indicated that it would accept, but with respect to these other items, again, it'll deal with the municipality. Yeah, the width. I mean, if you're saying this is the width that was approved for this road dedication, there's no place or availability to widen the road, but it doesn't matter because the burrows that this spec was approved now, I'll tell you, by ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Sportsplex", "insights": [{"observation": "The driveway was built with no curb to allow sheet flow into trenches in the railroad right of way.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The curb was only added to the west side of the road and not the east side.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The plan to add a grade curb and channel all the water into concrete on that side is being discussed.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The site plan was approved in 2011 and aligned to municipal specifications.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Concerns about responsibility for roadway maintenance until the road is dedicated to and accepted by the municipality.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Sportsplex", "insights": [{"observation": "The driveway was built with no curb to allow sheet flow into trenches in the railroad right of way.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The curb was only added to the west side of the road and not the east side.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The plan to add a grade curb and channel all the water into concrete on that side is being discussed.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The site plan was approved in 2011 and aligned to municipal specifications.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Concerns about responsibility for roadway maintenance until the road is dedicated to and accepted by the municipality.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1884134, "chunk_end_time": 2361672, "base_url": "https://fb.watch/sqebbyPp9Y/", "chunk_url": "https://fb.watch/sqebbyPp9Y/"}, {"start": 24000, "end": 30000, "text": "ould have a road.

We're gonna have to put a new top coat in, because if I was a borough, I wouldn't take it. And so I know that some improvements will have to be made to it. Yeah, absolutely. There's a way you can cut the pavement. I am not familiar with details of the approval from 13 or 16 years ago. I think just around the tab, maybe does not remember, remember the details of this original approval. So you look at that curve there. So I think at this point, it's your opinion, Mister Noah, that the board is going to set the conditions of acceptance of the right of way. It's going to be to borrow. So I guess the board would defer those requirements to the borrowing in the future. Whenever we get to the point where I believe that's what the way that it works. Yes. Okay, then that's good. Yeah. And in the interim we'll approach Conrail, see what we can do. The only, the other comment was no parking on both sides of the driveway. And I believe the owner or applicant has indicated that once the parking and everything in the back is completed that he has no problem with those signs. No parking on that side. Currently there is parking there. Now once we have the additional parking area finalized and approved, then that parking will go away. We want the no park to be in place prior to the road. Correct. That's fine. Yep. Once it's dedicated, there won't be parking. No parking. That's fine. Not a problem. To be clear, there is no parking permitted on the current driveway. No. Could we have the sign added now because it's only a 24 foot driveway. So 24 foot wide driveway. I would suggest a adding signage on that side because again, it's only 24ft wide. It's not wide enough for two way traffic and on street. I think we have a concern about that because we haven't had a problem with it at all and the parking is utilized. Excuse me, can I speak? Certainly. Okay. I just wanted to say that recently I got emails from both EMS and fire requesting that parking be eliminated. I didn't know that it wasn't allowed. I didn't know anything about it. I literally got these emails last week and so I haven't really done anything with them yet, but I thought I would mention it since we're starting to talk about it because both of those emergency services indicated to me in their emails, and I can send them to the board if the board wants to see them, that they have both had trouble getting in to the Sportsplex. And especially EMS said that they respond to calls there not frequently, but, you know, higher than average of any place else that they respond to. And recently they had a CPR call and they had difficulty getting in because people actually did park on both sides. And then somebody was coming in from the, you know, they were entering from Durham and somebody was coming from the other side and then, you know, it was just a big mess. So I'm just telling you that they both recently reached out to me. So I'm putting it out there for the board to know that. And I did a recent inspection at night and I saw exactly what you were seeing. I'm not sure if I saw parking on both sides, but I do know I saw parking on at least one side, which I don't think it's designed to fit that with two way traffic. Let me try to address all of those comments. We've worked closely with the police chief and the fire marshal to sign and, if necessary, tow cars, and I'd like to thank them for their help and their cooperation on this because it's a challenge on the east side of the drive lane because the fire and ems can't get in on the west side of the drive lane, directly in front of the sportsplex. Parking is permitted under the site plan, but more importantly, fire and EMS traffic shouldn't be going up there anyway. That was not part of the approved fire plan. They're supposed to turn right before they get there, and they have full flow all the way around the building. And the reason they made that complaint legitimately so was when the flood took place at the Everbrook daycare facility. They chose to come in through Middlesex Avenue on a, quote, non passable road, cut the fence to get in, and therefore they couldn't get around because they were coming in a road that didn't exist. Had they come in Durham Avenue, they would have had no trouble with it. So I understand why they complained, and I appreciate, you know, them trying to be as efficient and respond as quickly to the casualty, but there isn't a problem there today, and we don't have to wait for the road to get dedicated either. As soon as the parking is in, we will be happy to put in no parking signs. So anyway, in summary, though, there is no parking on either the east or west side of the road until you get to the curb cut to turn into the sportsplex and the daycare facility. And there is parking only on the west side of the road. And we have signed everything on the east side of the road with the help of the fire marshal and the police department will do a", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Applicant (unnamed)", "insights": [{"observation": "The roadway maintenance is going to be the applicant's responsibility until it gets dedicated to the municipality.", "classification": "Governance", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The road will need improvements, such as a new top coat, before the municipality will accept it.", "classification": "Governance", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "No parking on both sides of the driveway is being implemented once additional parking area in the back is completed.", "classification": "Social", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Emails from both EMS and fire departments requested that parking be eliminated due to difficulty in access.", "classification": "Social", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The site plan includes parking regulations with cooperation from police chief and fire marshal for safety.", "classification": "Social", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Applicant (unnamed)", "insights": [{"observation": "The roadway maintenance is going to be the applicant's responsibility until it gets dedicated to the municipality.", "classification": "Governance", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The road will need improvements, such as a new top coat, before the municipality will accept it.", "classification": "Governance", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "No parking on both sides of the driveway is being implemented once additional parking area in the back is completed.", "classification": "Social", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Emails from both EMS and fire departments requested that parking be eliminated due to difficulty in access.", "classification": "Social", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The site plan includes parking regulations with cooperation from police chief and fire marshal for safety.", "classification": "Social", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 2295366, "chunk_end_time": 2749634, "base_url": "https://fb.watch/sqebbyPp9Y/", "chunk_url": "https://fb.watch/sqebbyPp9Y/"}, {"start": 29000, "end": 35000, "text": "e flood took place at the Everbrook daycare facility.

So anyway, in summary, though, there is no parking on either the east or west side of the road until you get to the curb cut to turn into the sportsplex and the daycare facility. And there is parking only on the west side of the road. And we have signed everything on the east side of the road with the help of the fire marshal and the police department will do anything they ask us to do to improve that on the east side. Yes, sir. You have on parcel 80, as shown on that exhibit, existing gravel parking area that under the approval for federal daycare. You're only using 31 spaces for sports bus? Yes, sir, absolutely. There's a good number of additional spaces. Driveway and expand those 31 spaces to offset whatever number of cars are able to fit along that curb line on the west side. And then the problem of emergency access goes away and you have parking. I think the board would let you use more parking in the gravel area to resolve this. I am happy to do that. Yeah, it's a good idea. I'm happy to do that. If the board let us. If the board would let us do that, I don't have a problem with it, period. Let me tell you what the problem the police department has had with it. And the police department is right. So I'm not taking issue with it. I can't deal with the people who choose to ignore these new parking signs. No, I understand that. And so we can tow from the east side because on the east side it was always forbidden. The police department won't ticket and tow on the west side because it was the site plan allowed for. I'm agreeing with you. So this is not me. I think it's a great idea. So I just. I don't want everybody coming back to us and yelling at us because people are parking there because they're not supposed to. We have people standing outside to shoo them away. I brought the general manager with me, but as a part of this proceeding. Yeah. Can the board require the developer to designate that there's no parking along the west side of the swarthy driveway from the rear of the building all the way down to Durham Avenue? And that should be signed as no parking. And that the developer will provide tile 39 jurisdiction. Jurisdiction to the municipalities, that they can enforce the parking restriction and that the developers allowed to expand the use of the existing route to the parking lot to offset those, that number of parking spaces and provide temporary lighting. I will be excoriated if I don't ask the general manager first. You'll excuse me. To answer your question. Yeah, we definitely should require title 39 jurisdiction on this property, which for some reason I feel like we did already, but just in case we have. Yep, I think we're fine with that. So if the resolution authorizes an expansion of the 31 space area to offset what's lost, we have no issue signing the west side and prohibiting parking there. And we recapture those spaces in the back. And you can make that a part of this approval so that we'd have the additional parking in the back and we give, if we don't, haven't given you title 39 and we'll take a look at it. I always thought we. But if it hasn't been granted, it can be granted. That's not an issue. I anticipate that some of that extra parking may extend into parcel D. So we probably should have an easement as well. Yeah, I don't think so either. And wherever it is, it is. No, we're going to add. We're going to add parking in the back to compensate. We will. Okay. We'll add parking in the back area. Okay. So we have consensus and let the record reflect that. Good suggestion and good feedback. Thank you. And I don't think there's anything else in the reports that's an issue. I think everything else is just mister. Everything else seems to be exposition or we're requirements, but nothing else. Do you have any other. Yeah, there's some clarification about the owners of lots. Thank you. I guess the first thing we should do is ask board members their questions for these two professionals other than the ones that have already been offered. Okay. Are there any plans for development of Lot B, which was supposed to have the senior living but does not? Stuart's getting some exercise here entirely and hasn't been the subject of an approval as far as I know. But has there been in the past 20 years? I'm sorry. Repeat the question, please. Can you speak into the microphone? I think yes. Okay. Me. Miss Clarkson, are there any plans in the future or near future to develop lot B, which had the senior living approval but you said is not going forward, and lot D, which is the 1.9 acres which is vacant end, doesn't have an approval. And when these two lots are coming to the board for site plan approval, if we grant the subdivision today, what will happen to the shared parking and the easements that are existing for the lots?

The pandemic caused them to cease operations for any new dementia living tracts and they shut down all of their new developments and terminated the contract.

Parcel D, at the same time, which was August of 2021, was under contract to age restricted housing, which is not to be confused with dementia, but just age restricted senior living. Assisted living mix of uses. They too got stung right before they obtained site plan approval. The replacement tenant also withdrew because they were so far ahead of our development. They were. We had no plans to do construction for at least a couple of years because we didn't have site plan approval for either the Starbucks or the Everbrook at the time. They were actually the ones who were going to build the road because they needed it first. So they were going to build the road in early 2022, a new replacement to both of those came in and has had the property under contract for senior living since, I want to say about March of 2020. What are we in 24? So March of 2023, they have, as I understand it, they have a conceptually. Have a pilot approved. They have a conceptual agreement with the burn on pilot pilot, and they have a concept plan which has not yet come before the planning board for both parcel B and D. It's the same owner, same user, and it would be the same uses on both parcels. So they're in negotiations with. Not me. I talk to them regularly. But our deal, if you will, has been done for 18 months. And just to be clear, they don't have an agreement with the borough for a pilot. No, I said conceptually, they have understanding of terms. I'm sorry. Yeah, I didn't. I don't want to. That to be clear. Thank you. Okay, so we still basically are in a position of really, there are no plans in the immediate future coming to the board or development of lots B and D. I can't speak to that because it is not in my hands and the property is under contract. So I think it's really a question for the municipality. You have an agreement, the property is under contract and they have. The approvals are in their hands. Correct. You're not involved in the process? I'm not at all involved in the process. If they had site plan approval, they would be under construction probably in about this is January, by next fall. And part of the problem as it relates to this is our redevelopment agreement stipulated that we had to put in curb cuts when we built the road or whoever physically built it, we're responsible to build it, but whoever physically built it had to put in curb cuts for parcels B and D. But after artists senior living and the next two contract purchasers of parcel D went away, we don't know where the curb cuts go. There's no approved site plan. Yeah, but, I mean, in approving this subdivision, aren't we approving Greenway Avenue, the whole extent of Greenway Avenue? Yes, but we're just going to do it without curb cuts. Somebody's going to have to come in and add curbs and entrances at some later date. Once there is. Once a site plan, approval comes before this board and is approved. So with this time, the only curb cuts that are planned or that we know of will be, will serve Starbucks, the Starbucks lot and the cannabis lot. Is that correct? On Greenway Avenue? Yeah. The cannabis curb cut is on Greenway Avenue is not changing. Starbucks has a curb cut and when we went to the county, because this is Middlesex Avenue is a county road, we went to the county for their approval for the intersection. This is 14 months ago. When it wasn't completed until seven months ago, they made us completely reconfigure the intersection. So it's getting. If you went by today, I think today it's almost all torn up. So it's got to get rebuilt. And one of the benefits of that will be that the new intersection will align with what will ultimately be the entryway to Trailhead park. Okay. I raise these concerns because when those applications were before the board, there was significant testimony and questions from the public regarding traffic circulation. Both Starbucks and the cannabis use are expected to be high volume, shall we say, in terms of concentrated time periods. And there was definitely a concern raised about ingestion on the proposed Greenway Avenue. You I was here. The Starbucks. That is why the Starbucks C of O, though, was conditioned by the county. The county conditioned the passable road, be complete before Starbucks could open. The Everbrook isn't the subject of this, but as a result, and we agree with that because the traffic study said we really want Starbucks patrons, as they leave, to be able to turn left and they don't all dump into Middlesex Avenue. So that was the. So the road, which is anticipated to be completed at the end of April, the road and Starbucks are not going to be. One's not going to be completed before the other. We can't have one without the other because we're concerned that we meet the traffic requirements once the cannabis user is open as well. My anticipation is that the county will request a new traffic study and that will result in the light being put in light being installed.

My anticipation is that the county will request a new traffic study and that will result in the light being put in light being installed. And one of the other things, when we do hear a site plan application for BND, do you anticipate any parking issues? Will there be sufficient parking spaces for the intended uses at this time? Because right now one of the easements is for parking between the sports flex and the nursery school. Again, I can't speak to anything on that. Those two uses other than they're under contract. I can tell you anything material to the contract, but I'm happy to do that. But I can't speak to that. I know that from my experience of that use and the amount of parking that will be required, my personal feeling is they will have sufficient parking and they'll certainly. But I can't tell you anything definitively that's going to be their obligation when they come before the board. Under our contract, they're obligated to get approvals, their approval, the contracts are contingent on that, and they'll have to come before the board and demonstrate that they meet the parking requirements. Well, we're ordinarily, or I should say routinely, when there's a request for subdivision, it's usually complemented by a request for site plan approval at the same time because these are coming in at different times. This is why I'm just raising these concerns, because, well, the issue here is pushed down the road, so to speak. Well, I agree with you, but it's been pushed down the road beyond the control of the borough. So when artists came in, they had a subdivision approval and as a practical matter, site plan approval. They had a site plan approval and a subdivision approval. And as a practical matter, Greenway avenue, the location is not moving. There's not some alternative that's going to have any significant traffic impact in the universe. It's coming in, it's going to make that right turn, then make the left turn onto and tie into the sports puck's driveway. The location of the driveways. Now, we used to know where they were on b when it was artists, and we have never known where it will be for dee, as in David. But those are like a driveway to a house. And like, they build subdivisions and you show up and you want your garage on the left side or the right side. So they move driveways around all the time. There's not many places for them to go. They're going to align that driveway with the vertical leg of that intersection for D. That's where that's going to be. That's where I see it coming. If you look at that exhibit where the road, Greenway Avenue comes in off of Middlesex, it makes that right turn, that's going to become a t intersection. That's how I envision it in the future. For that use, must they have some extraordinary need to have a driveway somewhere else and B, where Artis was approved? Our traffic engineers are going to figure it out. We're not going to create traffic mayhem. And we really have no place else to build a road. That's a practical matter. So you're right. It's usually together. And it used to be together. It started out together, but artists isn't in the picture anymore. You know it. So it's kind of like we backed into it and we now have the daycare use ready to go in the back with a setback of because of a water leak and Starbucks is cruising along, apparently in construction. So we need the road, the base course pavement where it's safe to use with the temporary striping, traffic control signage, just like in housing developments that many of us have driven through that are under construction. They got some houses complete and some aren't. It's just base course, paved and temporary traffic stuff, and people live there and use it. So we need that for the new uses to exist and for the future construction to be able to access the property. Thank you, mister Mayor. Okay, can I add one comment? Thank you. By the way, Mister Max, I couldn't have put it better. We intended the contract with. The contract purchaser for B and D stipulated that they would come in with subdivision at the same time as site plan approval. So. You're absolutely correct, Miss Clarkson. That's the way it was supposed to work. However, their site plan application has been delayed a number of times, and once the cannabis use was approved and the conditions of the cannabis use approval wouldn't allow us. I don't know. Wouldn't allow us is the right term. We had to get subdivision done out of sync to accommodate the cannabis use, and so I had to get the consent of the parcel B and D contracts of the parcel B and D contract purchaser to do this. You do have two microphones up there. Yeah. The issue. Okay, so, yeah, the issue is one of the additional use requirements of the cannabis is that it be on seven lots. So it has. The subdivision has to take place where the cannabis facility can open. So that's another thing that's driving why we're here, as opposed to waiting until there's a site plan for B and D. I would add that this is more or less a formality. The redevelopment plan, which is, I don't know how old now. Years and years and years, has always envisioned this, I guess.

I don't know whether it's the exact, but if it's not the exact, it's very similar to what's here. So every application that we've looked at on this site has envisioned exactly what we're doing, which is subdividing the property. So there's nothing. I just say that because there's nothing, you know, very magical or, frankly, complex about this other than what we've been talking about, which is there's some details, but, I mean, we. It has been envisioned that these were going to be separate lots, that that roadway would be there, that it would be eventually dedicated to the borough, that it would have the same configuration that it has, et cetera. So it's, you know, substantially the lines that are in the redevelopment plan. Right. Similar. I don't know if they're exact, but we looked at when we went in for the individual rules. Right? Yeah. And I'll just add that for the potential future development of parcels B and D, they are in flux. Whatever uses it may come out of it will are not going to be consistent with the uses permitted in those districts in the redevelopment plan. And they will require an amendment to the redevelopment plan, which will be an action taken by the governing body as the redevelopment entity. So when that ordinance is introduced, whenever that may be, this body will have an opportunity to look at that revised or amended yet again redevelopment plan. And I'm sure there'll be amended redevelopment agreements as well to deal with the roadway and CEO openings for various businesses. Thank you, Chris. The lifetime of this application, we need a program to tell the players. Right. But all in good stead. And Stuart, if you're not wearing a Fitbit, you missed out on about 10,000 steps so far. So just for future notice. Okay, where are we at? We were asking questions that were, some of them that was. I think Mister Mannik should get Academy Award for his. No, I think excellent, excellent, valid, good questions that we want to ask. And typically, things would evolve in a different way. Right. So I think that they're all good, substantive questions, but I miss out of the essence. People have lines to get back to, so please proceed. That's pretty much our presentation. We went through the reports. Basically, this is really essentially a technical subdivision to create lot lines that comply with the parcel lines and the redevelopment plan. Okay. And we think we've addressed all the ancillary issues. So I'll say again, any other questions of the professionals from the planning board being none. Bob, would you like to open the public portion? Yes, we should open the public portion. Okay, so now the public portion is open. If you have a question or a comment, come forward to the microphone. Give us your name, your address, tell us what's on your mind. And seeing none, I'm going to then say there is none and close the public portion. Do we want to do findings of fact or a recounting of the things we amended today? We really don't have a lot of changes or conditions. Frankly, we did discuss, and I suppose it would be a condition, we're not going to permit parking on the west side of the roadway. We're going to permit the parking to instead be in the back of the sportsplex building. We should have a condition that something to the effect that the roadway will be completed so that it's passable and satisfactory to the. You want to make it the board engineer, the borough engineer, Bob. Okay, Bob, regarding the relocating the parking from the west side of the driveway to the back of the sportsplex, to be clear, we're just putting lines on a map. We're not adding additional gravel, correct? Right. That's correct. And I think they have temporary power, temporary lighting for what they will be utilizing to replace the parking that they're going to lose along the driveway. Is that correct? Yeah. There's going to end up being more gravel because there's been a lot of mud. So, I mean, I can't. You get it? Gravel areas far. We're not expanding it, it's just maintaining. That's fine. Yes, it's gonna. Well, it's gonna extend. It's gonna extend to the way it looks there now, that's the pre existing condition. Right. From the room it's gonna. Yes, it's exactly right. Okay. And there is a fence there now because the road's under construction. Yeah, it's fine. And eventually the roadway is going to be completed for dedication to the borough subject to approval of the borough council. Other than that, I don't think we have anything, you know, any other conditions that I can think of that we've discussed or did we miss anything? Okay, well, Bob, do we have to say anything about filing updated plans or indicating any of these conditions on the plans? I just want to avoid any discrepancy or question down the road. Literally. They will have to. Yeah, we always have that. They have to submit, you know, revised plans, the approval of the board engineer and so forth.

You have to have a plan and then they will have a flat that are going to file. Okay. So that's what I want to make sure again, because there seemed to be a question raised about a prior approval and the clarity with which that's been interpreted. I think we solved the clarity problem because I brought that up that I wasn't present. But they agree that we're going to remove the parking along the driveway. We're going to give them whatever number of spaces they need, replace them in the back of the building, and if they have to give the township title 39 jurisdiction, for police to enforce it, then they'll do that. If the police are satisfied with the prior approval I was planning on putting in what we had, that they are going to give title 39 jurisdiction, because you're going to want that on this whole site. Otherwise, you know, you've got. Right, right. You've got parking, you've got roadways, you're going to have everything. You have to have title 39 jurisdiction. There you go.

Is anyone going to talk about this with any grace? We're going to have. The borough council has referred to the planning board, the capital Projects review, and a courtesy review of this proposed emergency services building.

And with that, Bob, tell us why we're here tonight. Thank you. So this is for members of the public who may be wondering what the agenda is for this evening. So the borough is coming before the planning board with plans for an emergency services building slash complex. The matter is before the planning board for three reasons. One, there is what's called Capital Projects review. There is a statute, 4055 D 31 that basically says that if there are to be substantial public funds that are to be expended in connection with the capital project, that the governing body is supposed to refer that to the planning board for its review and recommendations. Then the second reason is that the municipal land use law also provides at 4055 D 26, that the governing body may provide for classes of items to be sent to the planning board for its review. They include things like buildings, acquisition of land, vacation of streets and the like. So that's the second reason. And then the third reason is what we call colloquially, courtesy review. The borough is not necessarily bound by all the strictures of the municipal land use ordinance, but usually public bodies such as the borough, the county, if it had a project or the school board, would come before the planning board to review the project and again make recommendations. I should note that although I did mention the zoning ordinance, that this is a use which is permitted in the zone in which it is situate, which is the r two zone, which does permit uses that are allowed in the r1 zone. And in the r1 zone, borough operated public facilities are permitted. So this is a use that's permitted in the zone. So with that, Mister chairman, I understand that the borough attorney, Dennis Murphy, is here. And he's going to present the case for the borough. Excellent, Mister Murphy. Educate us. Good evening, all. And thank you, Bob. I mean, he really has taken the words out of my mouth. And pretty much everything that I had to say for tonight. Because the ball pretty much tonight. Is going to be in h two M's court. The architects who have planned and designed the project. Also we have here tonight is Melissa Perlstein. And I just want to mention one thing. I have never noticed that there is on this side, that there is a crest there. I've never been on this side, but I'm here. If you have any questions relating to the borough, I could just point out the borough did pass a resolution in February. Referring this matter to the planning board. For its review and recommendations. And with that being said, I'll turn it over to the h two m representatives. To go through the slides for you. Thank you. Thank you. My name is Richard Scharmer. And maybe Miss Burnham is with me. Why don't we swear you in, if you don't mind? Yes. You swear or affirm the testimony that you're about to give in this proceeding. Will be the truth and nothing but the truth? I do. And state your full name for us. And spell your last, if you would. Sure. Name is Richard B. Schomer, junior. Last name Sc Chommer. And our names are up on the. I see them up on the. On the screen there. If you not sure if you need to spell them. So I see. Yes, I do. You know what? If you're going to have someone else testify, why don't I swear heroin as well? Yes, please. You swear from testimony that you're about to give this proceeding will be the truth of nothing but the president? I do. And your name is? Megan Burnham. Okay. And spell your last name for us. B u r n h a m. Thank you. And I'll try to be as annoying as I can at the onset. Is that we only have one microphone for you both to share. And yet this will be televised. So as hard as that is to go back and forth, we're gonna ask you to kind of trade off. To the extent that you can. And it does come out of the stand, you can pull it out. That's fine. Okay. I think I'm good here.

I think I'm good here. We've got this. We have a PowerPoint presentation to kind of run through to show you some things. We have a lot of information if you want to look at it, but we're going to start with an overview. I'm going to basically do a little intro and describe some of the site and the conditions. And then I'm going to turn it over to Megan and she can talk more about the building and questions as we go along. Just please, please holler. So again, and by way of introduction again, my name is Richard Shomer. I'm licensed professional engineer and a professional planner in New Jersey. I'm also a certified municipal engineer and we both work out of the Persepine office of H two M Architects and engineers. And I have represented municipalities as an engineer and board consulting engineer and also represent applicants before planning boards. This one's a little different because I like to think that we're before an audience that wants to hear this and wants to see this sometimes. Unfortunately, we don't. So hopefully this is a welcome. So anyway, so just to kind of get straight into it, I'm sure board members know the borough's planning this new emergency services center. You see a rendering here of the front. So we start off with a pretty picture of it. So what I'm going to do is go through some slides and kind of tell you a little bit about the site and where we are. And I know you're probably looking at this one the same thing. So this slide shows on the left side an aerial view of the site outline in red. It is, by the way, they're the same. So if it's easier for you to look there, you don't have to turn around just because we're looking up here, you know. Thank you. I have it here too. I'm never sure. So it shows the property outlined in red. It's, I think total size is a little under two acres. I think 1.8 acres, 1.75 acres or thereabouts. As you know, we have safety place, which comes off of Essex Avenue, which is route 27. There's a driveway that comes in and serves the current first aid squad area. So that's the site. And safety place is going to stay. It is a municipal street. It is right away, I think, of about 40ft that's going to stay. A portion of the back of safety Place is going to get vacated and merged with a bunch of other lots. There's a whole bunch of small little lots in there and they're going to get merged into one combined property. So that's the site on the right hand side, obviously is a picture kind of what you see from Essex Avenue looking into the site and the sign and the existing building, you can see in the background of that, the lawn area in the front that you see in this, in that photo is really where the new building that we just looked at, where this new building, not quite the same view, but from Essex Avenue looking at the front of the building. So this is. We've prepared a full set of detailed site plans and architectural plans. This is one of those plans, the dimensional site plan. So what you see here, and just for orientation, Essex Avenue is at the bottom of the screen. So you see shaded on the left side, safety place running in. As I said, that's an existing Municipal street and a portion of the back of safety place is going to get vacated and those properties are going to get merged. The shaded area is pavement, is new pavement area. There's a parking area in the back now, and if you've been back there, it's in terrible condition. So that's all going to get replaced. We're going to expand the pavement in the parking area and provide for some additional parking. The existing building that we saw in that photo, that's going to be demolished. And so the building, and I don't have a pointer which really points to there, but in the back left is a new. Is a new building. The main firehouse is in the front. So that's the front area. And we'll have some more pictures of that firehouse. The faces, as we saw in that photo, it faces right onto Route 27. So there's good access onto Essex Avenue. The firehouse building is about 12,240. Building in the back is about 3600 sqft. That back out building on this site, we have a total of 42 parking spaces. So that's for, obviously, the folks who are going to be stationed here, working here on a regular basis. And also in the event there's some other events that need to happen here, there's parking as you go up, safety place on the right hand side. There's three parking spaces just to the left of the firehouse building. And then the other 39 spaces are in the back. We've kept it pretty much open so you can circulate around in there. You can get a truck around in there. There's a pad in the back for some practice and emergency practicing fire activities. We have a dumpster pad on the site which will be enclosed, fully enclosed. So we won't have dumpsters just sitting around outside on the pavement. They'll be fully enclosed in an enclosure. We have some handicapped spaces.

So we won't have dumpsters just sitting around outside on the pavement. They'll be fully enclosed in an enclosure. We have some handicapped spaces. We actually, even, just as you look up here and just to the right, bottom right of the, of the parking spaces, we have the handicapped spaces. And next to them, we actually have some dedicated spaces which will be ev, electrical vehicle ready, so they'll be prepared for that. The site has some unique features in that and you don't see it here, but there's a, and it's dashed on the plans. But there's a very large culvert that runs through this site. So we had to respect that. And that's really where the distance between, or the space between the two buildings is, where there is a very large underground culvert, drainage culvert. And that goes to the back. And you can kind of see on the sort of just off site on the upper port part there, there's kind of shaded back is where the culvert then goes under the railroad. And I should have mentioned, we have the railroad to the back of us. There's commercial property to the west of us or to the left as we look at this plan. There's some residential properties to the east or to the right on the six Avenue and across the street. So just kind of some context there. We have a generator and a generator pad there as part of the improvements also, which will serve the, serve the building because we are expanding some of the pavement, we have to deal with stormwater management. And as, as I said, that culvert that's there, that stays, we're not touching that. There's actually some drainage that runs into it now. And we're going to keep that and kind of maintain that. The culvert itself, we don't change the overall drainage patterns, stay the same. And in fact, you can see if you look at the right side or right end of the parking area, we have a small, shallow stormwater management basin. So we're going to collect stormwater runoff from the parking area collected in this basin, control it, so we manage the stormwater from this site. The goal of stormwater management here, like elsewhere, is really to make sure that we don't have an increase in stormwater runoff from the site because we're building more buildings and having more pavement, which would result in more runoff. We have to control that so that we don't, do not have an increase. We don't have any, don't cause any problems to downstream neighbors in terms of runoff or adverse impacts. So we have that as part of the system. We have a stormwater management plan that's part of that. The back area to the right I should mention where that basin is. And over to the right, that's all wooded, and that's going to stay wooded to the maximum extent we can. That basin will be very shallow and there's not going to be a deep basin down a hole in the ground like. Unfortunately, we sometimes see. This next plan is the landscape plan. Again, one of the sheets of the. Of the set of construction plans that we've prepared for the site. You can see we show a number of plantings proposed on the right hand side and kind of at the perimeter there. We have a lot of buffering that we're trying to do between us and the neighbors. We're proposing 28 new evergreen trees as a buffer in there throughout the site. We'll have some other plantings, but one of the things we really wanted to do here was try to make it very low maintenance. So the cross hatched areas you see around the perimeter of the parking area by the outbuilding in the back, those cross hatched areas, that's all going to be like a native type grasses. So it's not something that we don't want to have lawn that has to be mowed and maintained every week. The plan was to really have it be low maintenance and be more sustainable. So that's a low maintenance, native type grasses that would be in those areas. The only place we really have some more formal shrubbery is really right up in the front and right by the street. The view that you see from the public would see from the street. And that's in the front, by the front entrance there. But we're using native plantings, which I think, and the borough, I think, has some guidance on that, that we've satisfied the meadow mix that I mentioned. And those other areas, again, for low maintenance. We have a lighting plan. We're proposing some lights in the back parking area. So there'll be some pole mounted lights, really? And those lights will be modern led cutoff type fixtures for down lighting, not to spread lighting all over the place, not flood lights all over the place. We're not going to have that. There'll be modern fixtures which will be down to provide lighting just in the parking area and where we want to have lighting, say, at doorways and elsewhere. I could go through more planes and more details, but I think that gives you a pretty good overview of what's there, what we're doing, the buildings that will be installed, the new parking. As I said, we talked about drainage. As you can see, access is right towards the front. We'll have an asphalt coming out and an apron right for access right onto Essex Avenue. There is an access from safety place to the commercial property to the left.

There is an access from safety place to the commercial property to the left. We're maintaining that, so that's not going to change for that neighbor that will still have access over there. What else can I tell you? Is there any questions I can answer? Something I missed or something? Let me know. We'll go to the board for that. Board members, do you have questions for mister Shomer on what he said so far? Can you just point out, I apologize, because I'm trying to see where the driveway is. Like where the fire trucks or the emergency ambulances would come out and how they intersect. Like if a fire truck and an ambulance kind of come together because they're both going to the same emergency, like how that works. Okay, so this, this rendering is probably the best picture to show. I see the main doors for the firehouse face right towards Essex Avenue. So you've got access. And that in that expanse of pavement that you see in the walkway you see across there, that that would be. You see the shaded area in front of the building? If you can. If you can kind of see that the bottom is across. The bottom is Essex Avenue. So the shade, and I apologize, the point won't really work on that. If you're going to use the pointer, you're going to have to use it up there, I guess, because we can't see that one, that shaded area towards the bottom, that's the pavement that we just saw on that rendering in the front. So the doors, those four doors are facing right towards Essex Avenue. And so it looks like it's three fire trucks and then one ambulance. Or is that just the example shown here? I think that's consistent, yeah, Megan can answer that. But so they'll be sharing the building, which is great, because we're consolidating the two existing buildings. And they have come up with, you know, what is their best first response? So the idea would be to have maybe not in that exact location, but to have one of the ambulances as front response. Okay, other questions from other board members. Gilbert and you mentioned EV ready. There'd be a couple of parking spots that basically a charger. Is that charging station for the use of firehouse or is that a public. What's the idea? Well, it's not for public, but if somebody has an electric vehicle and they need to charge it, there'll be a couple of parking spaces, which will be. We call them ev. Ready? They're ready. If you want to put in the. They'll be wired and have conduit going to those spots. So then you could easily put in the stanchion for making them available. It's not intended for public parking to come here. And, you know, it's intended really for the users of this facility. Are you running 480 or are you running 122? 40? What are you running? I'm not the me. Oops. I'm not the MEP guy. Sorry. Oh, I just. Is it a fast charger or is it a. I think typically, yeah, they're usually wired for fast charger. Yeah. I only say that because we ran a low voltage when we did our parking lot and should have ran 480 charges in 2 hours versus twelve. So. Okay, I have a question or two. You mentioned a stormwater management plan. What is it? Well, the plan, we have actually a report that was submitted. How about like the, you know, the Reader's digest version? So what I indicated, the storm water from the parking lot gets collected into this detention basin. Okay. And it's actually, this detention basin is going to be for quantity of runoff as well as quality of runoff. So it actually helps what we put in the bottom of it and how we plant it with a select material actually provides a water quality benefit. So all of this is in accordance with the state standards, the New Jersey stormwater management requirements. Is it piped away or does it remain in the detention basin? It basically gets piped away. At the upper point of that you can see a little dark feature and there's a, and then it goes out to a little blue feature. That's where it gets discharged. And then it follows the same drainage pattern that occurs today. So it goes to the back and goes toward the, toward the railroad track goes into, there's a collection of culverts at that point and then goes under the, under the railroad. So there's a collection system and then it controls the outflow so that we again manage the runoff. So it doesn't, we don't have more runoff after this is built than we do today. Will there be an operation and management manual? There will be an operations and maintenance plan for that, yes. I have to think about this. Usually the board requires that those be recorded. So there's a record of what has to be done. Yeah, that's commonly done in terms of the borough, how that gets. You want to do that, that's fine. But it could certainly, certainly that's a common practice. Yeah, I don't know. I have to think about that because usually the borough is who enforces them. So I don't know whether it makes, you know, whether it makes any sense in this case, self enforcement. Yeah. Yeah. Bob, how do you want to proceed?

Why don't we have her testify and then we'll see if there are questions from the public. Sure. Okay. It's all yours. Thank you. So again, my name is Megan Burnham. I am a senior project architect at H two M. I first just want to say thank you for taking the time to review this project. This has really been a labor of love with the fire and ems. They have put hours and time into this project. They have thought about every space. It has been really enjoyable to watch them see this come to life. They have made sure that nothing has gotten forgotten, and they have maximized the space to make sure that it's a efficient as possible. So we were able to just put the plans together and make them come to life. But really, they have had the vision, with the help of Melissa, to really get this. To this point. So I really have to give them a lot of the credit here. I think it's just a testimony to their love for this community. So it's been a pleasure to work on this. So I've broken down the floor plan kind of into more of a very visually, something simpler to kind of understand. So, like my coworker said this, that we. This main building, it was important to site this so that it faced Essex Ave. Response time for both fire and EMS is crucial. So as the doors open, the truck gets straight onto Essex Ave. So it can get to the call as fast as possible. So that big, large space in the middle is the truck bays. So we have four front bays. Three of those bays are double deep, meaning we can stack two trucks again, making it an efficient building as possible. And then one of those bays is just a single depth. Some of the spaces still in red that support that space are some of the storage that they need, the EMS storage, some of the SCBA, which is the oxygen tanks that they. They use. They have a decontamination room, which is actually really important for the health and safety of the fire personnel. With the push against cancer, there's been a ton of research about when the fire personnel comes back from a site, they need to be decontaminating from the toxins that they get when they're out on the call. So this is a special, dedicated space that they can do that with the correct, you know, laundry in that area, something that they definitely don't have the space for now. Also, thinking about health and safety, we had a dedicated. It's a lot, we call it locker rooms, but as you probably walk a lot of fire, if you get the privilege to walk fire stations, you see a lot of the lockers on the bay floor. That's actually very. That's very dangerous. Think about a truck pulling out as fast as possible to go to that site. Maybe a guy is or a female is, you know, behind it, on the side, trying to get to the other side. We try to keep people off that bay floor. So we have a dedicated space for their gear, which is right off the bay so that they can still be as quick as possible onto that. Onto that truck. So continuing on with health and safety. If you move to the right of the building, we're now in the blue area. In the front, in that curved area, we have three sleeping quarters. You know, there's some times, whether it's a state of emergency or anything like that, where there's, you know, late nights, long hours, and we don't know what the future of EMS and fire is going to be. So we had to think about this building as a 100 year building. So we provided space for some three sleeping quarters. We also have a fitness area. You know, health and safety. Health is very important, keeping them active. We have a day room with a kitchen. We have a large meeting room so that they can stay up to date with all of their training that they need to do. And then we have an administration building towards the, sorry, administration offices area that's towards the back of the site. And again, that's for when they come back and they have to do all that paperwork. They have to file it and keep it as required on site. This is a dedicated area for that. Again, keeping with the efficiency. If you go to the right, this is the mezzanine plan. What's great about fire stations? On the truck floor, there are higher spaces because the trucks are taller, the garage doors. So it allows for a. Not a second story, but a mezzanine level. So to maximize that space, we added program to that area. So on the left, in the red, you'll see training. So they're going to be able to learn bailout and other practices that they use when they're on call. And then on the right, we were able. In that gray area, we actually were able to put a lot of our utilities, our mechanical, so our electrical, our mechanical, and some storage. So, again, maximizing all the space possible, making this a very tight and efficient building, was important to us, to t", "esg_v1": [{"name": "H2M", "insights": [{"observation": "The project includes a decontamination room which is important for the health and safety of fire personnel, considering the push against cancer.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project layout has dedicated locker rooms to keep personnel away from the bay floor, enhancing safety as trucks pull out quickly to respond to emergencies.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project includes fitness areas, sleeping quarters, and meeting rooms to ensure fire and EMS personnel can stay healthy, rested, and trained.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project focuses on maximizing space efficiency, such as using a mezzanine level for additional training and utility storage.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "H2M", "insights": [{"observation": "The project includes a decontamination room which is important for the health and safety of fire personnel, considering the push against cancer.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project layout has dedicated locker rooms to keep personnel away from the bay floor, enhancing safety as trucks pull out quickly to respond to emergencies.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project includes fitness areas, sleeping quarters, and meeting rooms to ensure fire and EMS personnel can stay healthy, rested, and trained.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The project focuses on maximizing space efficiency, such as using a mezzanine level for additional training and utility storage.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1828440, "chunk_end_time": 2215972, "base_url": "https://fb.watch/sqe4WG19SG/", "chunk_url": "https://fb.watch/sqe4WG19SG/"}, {"start": 24000, "end": 30000, "text": "es area that's towards the back of the site.

In that gray area, we actually were able to put a lot of our utilities, our mechanical, so our electrical, our mechanical, and some storage. So, again, maximizing all the space possible, making this a very tight and efficient building, was important to us, to the community. So these are just the, you know, the construction plans. But I thought it was just easier to explain with these as well. So this is the floor plan I just talked about. And then this is the mezzanine plan. So, as we were talking before, there is a building in the back that is considered an outbuilding. So that will be a pre manufactured metal building. And it'll have four bays with one side bay. In those four bays, one bay will be dedicated to a police vehicle. It'll be its own complete bay. So it'll even have a wall. And then on the right, with the three plus one out the side, that, again, will be for the fire and EMS. These are for accessory vehicles, not necessarily your first responders, because they don't have that front access to Essex. They will have to travel along safety place to be able to exit this building onto the road. This is a very simple building. This is meant to be almost like a garage, a glorified garage. Glorified being used lightly because it is just a garage. Minimal utility is back here. There's no other program other than vehicle storage. So just breaking it down to a simpler plan, that's what it's going to look like. The police is on the left. Fire and ems have those three bays in the front and then a side bay out the side. So now we're going to just get into a little bit of the elevations. I'll show first, kind of our construction drawings, but then I break them down to a better view. So, again, this is what we saw on the render, but this is more of a flat. When you're face on, this is what the building will look like. It'll have the four. So the four garage doors in the front. For the four bays, there will be a tower to have that presence of Matuchin. And then to the right, it'll have. That's actually behind that is the sleeping quarters. It has a nice rounded edge, just pretty much similar to the building that we are standing in today to kind of mimic that culture, the language of Matuchin. Oh, and. Sorry. So the red, or the maroon, I would call it, is. We picture that to be brick. And then above is that white band is a CMU. It's not just the CMU that you see, maybe in your basement, but it's a. The word escapes me, but it's a prettier CMU. So this would be, as you approach along safety place. This will be to your right. Again, we carry the bands of brick, the CMU, I'm going to remember the word, but the CMU off the side, kind of doing a banding, creating this elongated space. Again, this is only a one story building, but kind of has a presence of one and a half, a little bit grander of a building. And then these access doors will be important for the three parking spaces that are along that side. For the first 1st responders that are getting on site so that they can get into the building as fast as possible. This is the back of the building. So once you park your car, you'll come in this way. And if you take a step back and look at the entire building, this is what you see. As I was saying before, the front is four, the back is three, because only three of the bays are pull through or double deep. So these garage doors are, of course, a little less glamorous. We're in the back, no glass, but we thought that it didn't need as much as that presence out on the street. Let's save some money and do just regular garage doors in the back. And again, keeping the brick all the way through around the building, which is a very nice feature. And again, that CMU. And then this is the view from the neighbor over. Again, keeping the brick through. We'll have some windows to let in that natural light. This is, again, more of the administration. This is the meeting room. This is the day room and the kitchen. So, you know, really wanting to have that natural light so that the windows will be on this side and then this elevation. I apologize, but will be changing to a prefabricated metal building because of. Just because of cost savings. So this right now is showing the brick, but this will be changing to a prefabricated metal. These are just some of the architectural elements that are happening on the building. The borough of a touch and emergency service center sign. Again, just some of the details that we're really thinking about as we're doing this project. And then I really wanted just to highlight some of the energy and sustainability features. Again, this was really important to Matouche and h two m. We always design sustainably. A few ways to do that is to locally source all of our materials. You kind of don't want to bring in anything too far. First of all, it's expensive, but think about the carbon emissions.

Thanks. And I think I heard Mister Sharmer say you were using for lead, Chris. Locally adapted or native vegetation. Yes, yes. The low maintenance for that. Another bullet for you there. Okay, thank you, Megan. Bob, you know, do you want to do questions to the board first? Why don't we see what the board has? All right, board members, questions for Megan about her presentation. Okay, we don't seem to have any, so I'm going to go ahead and let's open up the, we're going to open up the public portion. If you have questions for Richard or Megan, you can come forward down to the well, that microphone right there. Give us your name and your address. Ask your question. And I'm looking around there and I see them in the back. Come right up. There you go. Come up to that microphone. Come up to our microphone. Tell us, don't be afraid. We're your friends. Give us your name and address and we'll try to answer your question. Yes, George, I live in 101 E. Six Avenue across of the new building. So quick question regarding the, you know, the, it will be facing Essex Avenue and the paved area will be, most of the activity will be happening over there. So I'm not sure if the project is considering the noise and all this activity will be happening. Normally. We are, as of now, we don't have any activity happening on this area. So there is no traffic, no noise. Even the landscape keep is different. So how this project will impact the zone and I'm living across of the street. So house evaluation services, did you guys consider all of this question while you building this aspect? All right, so one of the things that the fire and EMS is very aware of is we do not have, they do not use the siren. They don't have a siren. All of the lights that we are using are, you know, are purposely downlit. We are trying to be very cognizant of the neighbors and the fact that we are in a very populated by neighbors, by residential. Sorry, residential area. So those are a few of the. The tactics that we've used. I don't know, Richard, if you want to add anything, hopefully, there's not too much activity. So you don't have fire truck going in and out on a daily basis. So we hope there's not that much activity. Most of the activity in terms of cars and so forth coming and going, are going to be going to the back. So you've got the building facing the street. We think it's a nice, attractive building along the frontage right now. That's kind of. The area is a little unkempt. And we've got some. Just some old woods there. So we think it's, in some senses, it's going to be an attractive appearance. We don't expect it. Hopefully, there's not opening the doors and running out all the time. But the activity really, for cars and so forth, more focused on the back. So driving back, parking in the back, more of that activity, people are going to be entering the building from the rear. So in that sense, that's really more and more. The activity is going to be focused day to day. Hopefully, unless there's an emergency, those doors are staying closed and they're not running, coming in, driving in and out all the time. And I think, as Mister Renault said, this use is anticipated because the zone permits this type of use. So public health, safety and welfare certainly is something that has to be top of mind. And you need a facility somewhere, and this is, we think, an appropriate spot for it. And as Megan said, it's really kind of been vetted with the EMS and fire and so forth, that this really was thought to be a good location for it, and it is permitted in this zone. Okay. Other members of the public who might have a question for professionals. Anybody else out there in public? Okay. Oh, wait, there we go. We have one. Come on down to the microphone asking your name for the record. Good evening. My name is Grace Mendoza and I live in 87 Essex Avenue. I only have a simple question. This project looks great and it sounds great. I just want to know when it started. When. How long will it take to complete construction? Yeah, that's all. Okay. That's all. Thank you. The answer, in case anybody couldn't hear, it was 18 months. Thank you, Miss Mendoza. Okay, anyone else from the public? Well, see another gentleman from the back. Come on down again. Just let us know where you are, where you live. Hey, good evening. Timothy Jones. I live 23 Rose street, one of the lots that back up to this project. Three questions, really. Why do we need 42 lots parking spots for? Seems like it's more activity than just fire and the drainage. I know there's a drainage easement that runs along back there.

Okay, anyone else from the public? Well, see another gentleman from the back. Come on down again. Just let us know where you are, where you live. Hey, good evening. Timothy Jones. I live 23 Rose street, one of the lots that back up to this project. Three questions, really. Why do we need 42 lots parking spots for? Seems like it's more activity than just fire and the drainage. I know there's a drainage easement that runs along back there. There's no open grates. I know where you plan to move the water from. Where is it connected to? Because I know there's a drainage that goes underneath the railroad that's always full with water all the time over there and traffic patterns. You have plans for lights on the road to stop traffic? Is that part of this scope? If I remember them? Remind me. Okay, let me just go back to. So the last question. There's no plans for lights or anything on SX seven? There's no plans, correct. There's no plans for that. I mean, obviously, if an emergency vehicle comes out, the door's open and they have flashing lights and would have siren for on their truck, for example. But there's no plans for specifically a light on Essex Avenue. In terms of drainage, as I described, the plan is for runoff to be collected in this basin in the back, and it discharges to follow the existing drainage pattern. So right now, as you pointed out, sort of on the top of the page, there's an area where runoff flows and it flows toward those culverts, which then go under the railroad. So we're going to maintain that what gets collected in that basin then gets discharged in that same direction and continues that same drainage pattern. So we wanted to make sure that we weren't collecting a whole bunch of runoff and discharging it onto neighbors like yourself. So we want to keep it going in the same direction it goes today. But what the basin does is it controls and holds back the water so that we make sure that we don't have more water coming off the site as a result of this construction. So hopefully that answers that. The number of parking spaces was really done in consultation with fire and ems as to what potentially there might be a need for. There's not a plan for having major events here. That's not the plan. But when they do have gatherings, particularly when they have training and so forth, so they have training, as you heard Megan say, there's training rooms in the building. So ongoing training is an important part of emergency services. So when they have training exercises or training classes, we have adequate parking on site for that. Okay. Okay. All right. Other members of the public. Anyone else might have a question? Okay, Mister Murphy, are you a member of the public? I just figured I would just be sure about that. So. Okay, I'm going to close the public portion then, because it looks like we've satisfied that demand and come forth, Mister Murphy, with vigor. I just wanted to clarify one thing and a little information. It's my understanding that the borough anticipates, as part of this project, cleaning out the stormwater and sewer. Relating to the project as part of the entire project. The other thing I just wanted to point out is you heard a lot about fire and ems. The borough also intends to house the office of Emergency Management in the building as well. So I just wanted to clarify that. And with that being said, I want to thank everyone for their time, their efforts in the review, and the mayor and council. The borough looks forward to receiving the report and recommendations that you may have. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Chris. I noticed you brought a very comprehensive menu memo. Excuse me. And would you like to review any of those topics at this time? No, I don't think it's necessary, other than just stating that the proposed capital improvement project is, I find, to be generally consistent with the Matanta master plan. That's the purpose of what the planning board is supposed to be at least finding and recommending back to council of that. And frankly, I think we all agree that the construction of this is necessary to consolidate multiple municipal services which are currently in separate locations and in poor buildings. Poorly poor conditions at best. As far as the specific comments, all I ask is, without belaboring the points to set the borough consider them as they finalize the drawings for construction. Nothing specific, unless the board wants me to. Again, that's why I ask if there is something that you want to spell out that you wanted the board special attention to, we could do that. Or you just wanted to say that you wanted to be given due consideration before it's finally completed and hopefully take it into consideration and we can leave it open ended. That's why I ask you. I think as long as the planning board incorporates my letter for reference, unless there's a comment that the board does not feel applicable, then the governing body has information that they need. I think everything has a valid point, in my opinion. And there's been discussion about having solar readiness, which is great. And I actually do appreciate the air tightness, which is a great indoor air quality feature, especially if it's mechanical and inspected. Otherwise, I really have nothing really to add other than what's already in the report. Very good. Can I ask another question? You can ask as many questions as you like.

So now that it was brought up, I'm kind of curious to understand. I believe there's an existing line that's going to remain. So we're just not adding. I have to go back and look. Okay, so there's one for the amp because of the ambulances. Now, I guess I'm trying to picture it because I drive down that road every day, and now that I'm thinking about it, I can. You're referring to when the lights blink, stop traffic to not block the driveway, basically. And I think that's where we're asking. Are there any stop bars and lights? So I was trying to understand the reasoning behind the. No. Okay, good enough. So I'm sorry, did you guys want to jump in there for a second? Just to clarify, this is the current site of the EMS, and they have stated that there is a current blinking light that will be staying, but no additional lights or measures to enhance that are going to be had. So if you drive past today, whatever is there is stay. Okay? Okay. Thank you. So we opened it for public questions. Now I'm going to open it for just public comments. If you just want to make a comment and make a statement of any kind, we're going to reopen it again. If anyone from the public would like to make a statement, you could do so now. And I'm going to say I don't think anybody wants to. So I'll then close it for public comment. Oh, no. You got one. Well, I'm late on the drug. Come on. Come on up and. All right, hang on. When they get to the microphone, first of all, and secondly, I'm going to ask you to be sworn in now if you're going to make a comment. So if you'd raise your right hand, just swear we're affirmed that this testimony that you're about to give us proceeding will be the truth. Nothing but the truth. I do. Okay. And again, would you please state your name for us and your address again? My name is George Gerges, 101 Essex Avenue, Matuchen. Again, I'm just concerned about the activity. And if there is no lights. If you guys could add, it would be great. So we can reduce the noise if it's possible. Also, about the residential area around this project have to be considered. If there is devaluation or any kind of impact on those residents or houses around, it should be some enhancement to the residential area to overcome this project impact. If there is no impact, it's good. If there is an impact way or another, I believe maybe we can enhance this area to overcome the project impact. This is my comment. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. And again, since I missed it, I'm going to go slow and make sure I make sure everyone's had an opportunity. So if there's anyone else would like to make a comment. Okay, I think I've seen that there's no more comments, so I'm gonna second close the comment section. Okay, Bob, where are we at with this? Because this is kind of a strange thing. Did you want to say anything else, Mister Murphy? Are we done? No, I'll move on. Okay. All right. Well, this is a situation where if the board is so inclined to recommend that the project go forward, we'll prepare a resolution memorializing that for the next meeting. So, Mister chairman, if we could take a vote on approval, we'll have a resolution for the next meeting to formally set out the board's findings and recommendations. Excellent. Thank you, Mister Renaud. Is there a motion, Mister chairman, regarding Mister Cassandra's hope that his memo will be appended to our recommendations? Part of our. We are saying that he's asking that we make. That we want to say suggestion conditional. What's your. What language would you like to use? Or should I ask Bob that question? Well, by the nature. I mean, while this application is a site plan review in nature, but the reality is, any comments that we make, including my own, are non binding. So whether suggestions or recommendations, that's fine. Okay. Okay. So I'd like to make a motion to approve with Mister Cassenz's memo, suggestions attached. Thank you. Is there a second? I'll second. And we have a second. Okay. Joanna, can we have a vote, please? Yes. Mister Grossman? Yes. Council Mentelia. Yes. Miss Koskowski? Yes. Mister love? Yes. Mister Lifton? Yes. Miss Cohn?

So I'd like to thank the mayor of the council, our BA, for the process. It's always nice to have all of you behind us when we do this. So a little bit about Nick is he graduated from Jefferson High School in Morris County, I believe it is, right? That's correct. Went to Morris County Community College and then spent five years working for Dick's retail store. Right. So you know how to deal with people, correct? Yes, sir. Okay, so we're going to take some of that talent and bring it out to the road. Absolutely. And he was a very good athlete. I'm hoping that. I think he's going to have to play me one on one for all his promotions. So we'll work on your pay raises. But what I wanted to take a moment to reflect on here that we sometimes forget about is when you're. You know, the swearing in is a nice ceremony, and then the work starts. And what the work means is that he's going to be working holidays, weekends, birthdays. He's going to miss a lot. And that's the true calling of being a police officer, is that you're willing to be selfless and give back to the community. So that moment, I want to take the time to thank all the young men and women back here who do it every day and grind it out for years on end. Our auxiliaries come in. So again, thank you all for what you do, because people don't realize how much you sacrifice and how many things you miss. But that's the calling. So we're glad to have you here. We're glad to have the extra body appreciate the council for standing behind us. And welcome to Metashin. Okay, on with the rest of the meeting. And by the way, kids, you're welcome to stay. I'm sure you have tons of homework, important matters to attend to. You're welcome to stay. And if you have more questions, please, please have your parents email, okay? And we'll get your answers. All right, at this time, we're going to open the meeting to public comment. Anyone from the public wishing to address the council and mayor, please do so. The floor is yours. Anyone? Anyone wishing to address the council? Okay. Seeing none, I'm going to close public comment. Our borough administrator is now going to present our capital bond ordinance being introduced tonight. Sorry, Brendan. Good evening, everybody. I want to, first off, thank the finance committee, which is councilmember Jithwani, Councilman Candel, and councilman Delia for meeting to help develop this capital budget. And also, we will be introducing the regular general budget at the next council meeting. That was a bit delayed because we're in the process of finalizing the AFS, which is a financial requirement. We wanted to make sure that was all buttoned up before we came to council with the final budget. So let's get started this year, 2024, the capital budget. We have general capital, our normal 2024 road program, and then we have two significant grants that we received this year. But overall, when I was here last year, presenting in 2023, we had some very significant things that we capitalized. One was the emergency services center, which we are, are in the bid spec design phase now and then also our Edgar field project, which happily, I can say has been completed. And we'll have a grand opening on April 6, I do believe, at 930. So everyone and I know people are already out enjoying the field, so that's a really nice thing. Government doesn't usually work that quickly, so I'm very proud of the fact that we got that.

Government doesn't usually work that quickly, so I'm very proud of the fact that we got that. We bang that out so quickly and people are going to be able to enjoy it. So let's get on this year, as I said last year, with our capital, we really went. We went for the gusto in 2023. 2024 is a more conservative budget for this year, but let's get right to it. Okay, so we're going to be. Our general capital expenditure is about 6.4 million this year. Okay. 5% of that goes into our regular budget, which you'll hear more about, which is about 258,000. We use that as a down payment. Our New Jersey Dot municipal aid that we get every year to do our paving program came in at 606, approximately $606,000. Then we also get New Jersey. The two grants that I'll be talking about at the end of the presentation were for $877,000. Also, we're taking 100,000 from a developer reserve. When Whole Foods was developed, that whole area and track of land, along with the hub, there was some developer money that was set aside to improve infrastructure, and that some of that money, the 100,000, we're going to allocate to some soar repair and cameron and clean out, because we had some issues over in that area off of Lake Avenue this past year, which we've rectified, but we've really recognized that we need to address a lot of the things, a lot of our infrastructure underground, because it is aging and it is old. Okay, so, all in, all, the bonds and notes that we're going to authorize this year are about 4.6 million. The 6.4 is all in. It's all the grants. It's soft cost, it's everything. But when we whittle things down and back out the grants and back out some other things, it's about 4.6 million, which is our normal amount of money that we give or take since I've been here, other than last year, normally are what we bond for. Okay, what are we using it for? So, I break it down into the different categories, milling and paving. This year, we are only doing the three streets that we got grants for, and that is because the. The total project came in at 1.4 million. So we have. We're getting about 606,000 from the state of New Jersey, but we have to supplement the other money to. To meet that 1.4 million. So we're doing Grove Avenue to Edgar, Roche street to Newman, and Newman, and then Newman to Roche street. So, like I said before, in the prior slide, we have about 600. $600,000 that we received from NJDOT. And then the rest we will bond for. That encompasses not only paving, but it will also encompass any sidewalk work or curbing. That needs to happen. Then public works. Public works. We're expending about $770,000. That's for an automated, another automated garbage truck. We, luckily, after this expenditure, our fleet will be renewed. And hopefully we won't have to go out for a truck for at least another five or six years. The fleet was very depleted when I got here. And the past couple years we've been trying to replenish the fleet on a yearly basis. We also need to address an underground storage tank that is at a considerable cost. We have some DEP things that we have to comply with. There are gas tanks that currently are underground on Jersey Avenue that are utilized for all of our trucks. And DPW use it, the police department uses it. But we have to address some issues that we've come, that have come to our attention. Also, we're getting radios for the DPW that sync in with all of the radios that we purchased for police and fire. So everyone's on the same wavelength. That's super important, especially for our head of OEM, who is also our police chief. Because during crises, you know, natural disasters, it's really important that everyone can communicate. And DPW is a crucial player in everything that has to do with when we go into a storm crisis. Next we're buying a forklift. And then we're going to be doing some facility improvements over at DPW. Because if anyone's been been into the building on Jersey Avenue, it really needs some tender love and care. It hasn't been looked at in a while, so we're also allocating some funding for that. Then we have the police department. $400,000 for two police vehicles, purchasing of some rifles, and then some police vehicle cameras that need to be updated. Policing has become very technologically reliant, and as a result, after several years, you need to keep up with the technology upgrades. Next, borough hall. This year we're going to go for some restroom renovations on this first floor. Anyone who comes in and visitors know that it's in much need. I think certain council people in particular have called to my attention on occasions the need for it. And then also we're going to be replacing the flooring.

Policing has become very technologically reliant, and as a result, after several years, you need to keep up with the technology upgrades. Next, borough hall. This year we're going to go for some restroom renovations on this first floor. Anyone who comes in and visitors know that it's in much need. I think certain council people in particular have called to my attention on occasions the need for it. And then also we're going to be replacing the flooring. We have some carpeting that's been here throughout the building since it was built. And it's time to reinvigorate. And we just went through a whole painting process. And now we're going to replace the flooring, the old carpeting that's there with new flooring. Next, h vac improvements to both Borough hall and the senior center for whatever the reason, when these systems were put in place, they're somewhat, I wouldn't say complex, but convoluted in how they were installed. And we've had some significant issues both at the senior center and here with heat controls and air conditioning and what have you. So in an attempt to address that, we're bringing in an engineer to give us their opinion on what we need to do to heat things more efficiently and cool things more efficiently. So that's what we have there. Okay, our next slide. We're going to finally bring the borough into the 21st century in terms of mapping and technology. Right now, we're looking at digitizing and GIS mapping. Right now we don't have any of this. And it's pretty critical as a municipality to have this for multiple reasons. What we'll be doing is right now, the storm and soar maps are manual maps that are kept in the back of the head of the DPW department, the superintendent's car. You know, I think we could do a little bit better here. And this is a big project that we're going to be embarking on. Also construction, planning, and zoning. The technology that they currently utilize is no longer going to be supported, and it is phasing out at the end of this year. So we have to get on track and really move in a direction where we get things automated. So that's 275,000 for those upgrades. In the GIS mapping. Then we have sewer line repair and maintenance. I am very concerned about the aging infrastructure in the borough. And as a result, we are working on being proactive in terms of sewer lines, on their maintenance and repair. And just looking at that, scrubbing the lines, I knew more about sores than I ever care to. But it's really important to maintain them, because when they're not maintained, you don't want to deal with the repercussions of what happens as a result of that. And we had some significant issues, again on Lake Avenue. So we're expending about $300,000, 100 of which is coming from that capital reserve that I mentioned in the slide before. Then we have recreation improvements. We are going to be repairing and repaving the basketball courts at Oakland, Charles and Hampton. Okay? And that's from our rec commission, along with our director of REC, who have recommended that those be the basketball courts that we concentrate on. And then lastly, our fire department. We are putting aside $500,000 in a fire truck funding reserve. What that actually means is we're not going to buy, put in an order for a fire truck this year. Fire trucks are coming in at about a million a pop. So what this is, is we're putting this into a reserve, or almost like a savings, so that next year we can potentially look to go out and purchase a truck if we have some savings from our emergency services center. My hope is to take some of that savings, reallocate it through, and reallocate it to the purchase of a fire truck if we can save any money. But we don't. That's not. We're right at the beginning phases of this. We haven't gone out to bid yet, so we'll see as time goes on if we're going to have any cost savings once we get the estimates and go out to bid. But I'm hopeful that we'll at least have this in reserve and then we can talk about next year, because their youngest truck in the fleet is about ten years old, and their oldest truck, I think, is like 36 or 37 years old. So it's a really old fleet. We're building this amazing new emergency services center, and it's going to be important for them to be able to have a, have a truck to utilize after they move into this new building. Okay, so the last item on the list are the two grants I was talking about. The first is the Hillside bike lane project, which I'm sure council president Delia is very excited about. This will link the Grove Avenue bike lane, and that is going to happen within this year in terms of having the bike lane painted. But we held off on actually putting the bike lanes in because Grove Avenue desperately needs to be repaved. So that'll be part of, we'll hopefully get out to bid this year on that. And as such, the Hillside Bike lane project will connect Grove Avenue to the train station. It'll come down Hillside. There's a lot of work involved in trying to figure out the particulars of this, but we received $524,000, $524,000 from the state of New Jersey to let us execute on that. The next thing is a grant that we received that was a surprise to most of us, was the Grove Avenue Walkway rehab project. When we were sitting around trying to figure out myself, some other people were talking about how terrible the walkway is underneath Grove Avenue. And since the rest of Grove Avenue, all the sidewalk improvements will happen as a result result of that paving project, we thought, wow, wouldn't it be great to have this new walkway underneath the train trellis? So the state thought it was a good idea, too. And they gave us $353,000 for it. So that will. We're just at the infancy stages of this.

The whole street will be improved as a result of the paving and then as a result of this complement of the New Jersey grant. Okay. And that's it. That is my capital ordinance presentation. Any questions? Can you explain. Just curious. Can you explain Rose street to Newman versus Newman to Rose street? Why those are two different items? Well, it's because it connects in different areas. Like, the whole thing is one really long. The linear footage really is really long. It might be just when we were doing it. It might be. I would think that it's the same street. It was just how it was written in the grant to connect up. I don't know if that is clear. Is that because Newman kind of curves and comes back to Rose? I think so. It'll be the whole Rose and Newman. All of that will be redone. Good. Okay. Yeah. Anything else? That concludes my presentation. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. And Miss Pearlstein, what a great presentation. And obviously reflective of the work that you and Miss Cuthbert put into this. I know, also in conjunction with your department heads as well as the finance committee. So thank you for all your hard work. I know that the budget is not the most favorite time of year for our administration. Some difficult choices need to be made to be able to keep things manageable. But you did a great job. And you keep doing this every year, doing a great job on this exact area. The concept of saving. There's no impulse buy items here. You know, we've been working really hard and working well, as you can see, with our state and county officials, to get us grants and making the best of our limited resources.

Reports report of our borough administrator misses Carlstein. Hi. Usually I don't speak, but you get me twice tonight. Okay. Two things that are happening as of April 1. The first is we are starting our 2023 paving program. We were a little delayed and we awarded at the end of last year, but we had to wait for the winter and what have you. So we are here in spring and the first we are kicking it off on Wakefield Drive. So I know everyone. It's a very robust, vibrant plan. It's probably going to take us through the summer because of all the streets that are involved. So please be aware, the company will be reaching out to the neighborhoods as they start. They usually start their curb work and sidewalk work first and then they will repair and restore the roads. The next thing, April 1, is also the date that our new street sidewalk project is happening. The sidewalks from Main street all the way to Lake Avenue where necessary, are going to be replaced with the classic, as we like to call it, borough of Metuchen concrete with. With a little bit of brick thrown in between. This was a grant that we received several years, probably two or three years ago. And we are, we've all the businesses. I've worked with the MDA executive director Dawn Mackey, who I thank profusely for helping me get the word down on this to all the businesses. We have an on site project manager by the name of Larry who will be. Who met with all of the businesses over the course of. Will be meeting with all the businesses over the course of this week to introduce himself and kind of be the onsite person as well as our contractors. The businesses will be open, the police department will be directing traffic accordingly, and we'll be sending out nixels and other information for anyone. But please understand, all businesses are open on New street. It's just a little inconvenience, but at the end of the day it's going to make a big difference to the community.

Thank you. Thank you very much, council president. Thank you mayor. Just really quick game on part two for the Metunch and downtown alliance promotion is happening on Saturday from twelve to three. Check out the MDA's website or instagram or wherever else you get your MDA information to learn more about what's going to be going on on Saturday. And that's my report. Great. Thank you very much. Councilmember Kendall Yep, thank you. Pool commission chair Dan Hirsch and I met with Rick Perrine, Becky and Melissa two weeks ago to address the pool membership fees, necessary repairs and improvements at the pool, and the overall financial status of the facility. I'm happy to say that Becky and Melissa have again found a way to afford the necessary repairs and equipment replacement, including a complete roof replacement, as well as the replacement of the flooring and tile on the bathrooms, which will come along with a modest increase in the membership fees and usage rates. I applaud both Becky and Melissa's efforts and that of Rick and Dan and the commission in continuing to work together in a way that benefits the borough and I look forward to the beginning of the season in two short months for the fire department. A dozen members of the department attended the after the fire presentation, which was sponsored by the fire Prevention Bureau and Metuchen cares at the high school. This presentation, which was given by some of the survivors of the Seton hall dorm fire in 2000, which I just learned that Mister Delia was, was on the campus at the time and the presentation was a heartbreaking reminder of the dangers of the fire and not being a fire and not being prepared. Tonight, with the council's approval, three members, three new members of the department will be appointed, ensuring the continuity of our firefighting force, and the department is always looking for new members. So if you're interested in joining the force, please visit the website at www.matouchenfd.com. thank you mayor. Thank you very much. Councilmember Jiwani thank you.

The committee also discussed the after the fire program which was mentioned already co sponsored by the MFD and the Cares which was held on March 21 at the Matouchean High School. Also, the community leaders breakfast was discussed. Meetings scheduled for Friday, April 12. The Cares mission is forming strong partnerships and talk about committee sponsorship process to partner in programs that address addiction without stigma. The committee plans to host this event annually, providing a time to share thoughts and ways that the partners and the Cares community the Cares committee can work to get the word out and serve the community. They discussed project graduation sponsored plans for the upcoming school year. The committee discussed the amount of the sponsorship they voted to sponsor 1500 plus the cost of the clear bags for students. Approximately $600 to project graduation. Future programming includes doctor Paul who speaks to students and families around bullying wellspring programs for various ages. At the Metuchen YMCA four summer camp, Carol Volklan reported that the Metuchen care sponsored billboard is something that they're working on. I think it's the billboard. Just as you come into town on 27 after you pass Costco and the car wash and you're coming in, there's a billboard there and we're looking at putting some of our budget into putting up a notice there. Liza Davidson shared information about the Screenagers film cares the Cares community the cares committee has a lot going on. Jason Wilhold shared information regarding Rutgers University programs, offered free charge with information about the opioid crisis and Lisa Davidson gave an updated update regarding the NJPN National Conference taking place in person in Atlantic City and Kathy list shared information about DEA podcasts available to the public. Highly recommends listening to them the parade sorry, I'm looking to my the cares committee informs the community about all these things thanks to Brandon Ullig on the website. They're constantly promoting these ideas to get information out to the public, so they're really enjoying that new relationship. The parade committee met on March 19. They discussed the Memorial Day ceremony. The American Legion will provide the color guard. Dennis confirmed that the retired naval captain, Chaplain Wilfredo Rodriguez is available to do the benediction. The commission agreed to have Dennis Cain serve as the year's reviewing officer. The parade route was discussed. Reaching out to Chief Flaherty was planned and I have spoken to him and I have yet to relate information. The discussion continues. Other logistics of the parade were covered, as well as how we might have a Santasley built for us by the holiday parade. The next meeting for the parade committee will be Tuesday, April 16 at 715 pm. Board of Health met on March 13. We did not have a quorum so we weren't able to discuss much, but there is ongoing conversation between the committee members regarding the bike lane project, which was also mentioned, and the doctor Popeck continues to plan the bike safety film eventually, which will be hailed May 10 at the high school. Those working on the event are developing a panel discussion immediately following the film. And we'd like to promote this with all the other national bike month activities in May. And our next meeting on May 8 may have to be canceled due to member board members not being available. And that's my report. Thank you. Thank you very much, councilmember branch. I'm sorry, council member Jumbo. Okay, so the environmental commission meeting, they met last week, and they're planning to have a green fair in August. It's scheduled for August 18. It is the same day as the spring fair, which is an independent fair that will be in the borough. It's not run by the borough, but we're kind of piggybacking on the fact that there will be lots of people in town. So we're planning to have something that looks a little bit like a the farmers market on the plaza. There will be various tables and tents, each one covering a different green initiative. And also we plan to have a few electric cars or hybrid cars for people to come check them out. So there'll be, you know, more information forthcoming on that as that evolves. Also, there's going to be a Barnes hiking tour. Let me just open this up and I'll tell you. It tells me it can't open it up. So anyway, I'll get more information on that because we have time. It'll be coming mid April. So maybe at the next meeting. Let's see if it's going to let me open it. No. Yes, open. No, forget it. It's not looking good. So that's my report, councilmember branch. All right. I haven't seen this room since January, so it's good to be back. I have a short report all the commission's Arts council, Human Relations Council. There are two representatives from these councils in the audience tonight. Thanks for coming.

Working hard on doing their programming and planning and events and efforts for the 2024 calendar year. So keep working hard. Looking forward to some great things. Have some great updates from the Rec commission. Number one, just a fantastic sweetheart dance last Friday. I saw your husband there, Vanita. I saw the Hannah and Nora there. Good to see you again. It was fantastic. I think it was the biggest dance we've ever had, and everybody just really enjoyed themselves, including me and including my daughter. So hats off again to great planning for the sweetheart dance and to anybody who was in the rain last Saturday waiting for an egg hunt that never happened. I have good news. It will happen. New date and time is Saturday, March 30, at 09:00 a.m. at Metuchen High School. Bring your own baskets and can't wait to see you there. And just one more note on biking. When everybody who gets a bike out this spring, remember to, you know, tighten and so the handlebars doesn't fall off or something like that, which has happened to me before. So that's my report. Thank you. Excellent. Thank you very much. I have a couple things. One I could say very directly, April 6, we're having various. As the borough administrator. No, no, that's okay. Borough administrator mentioned. April 6, we're having a really special day out at our new park at Edgar Field, which is extraordinary. You know, I think it's so amazing that I don't think people realize the implication of what we've done there. That park is going to be activated immediately. There's been already some activation. I heard an anecdote from the superintendent schools who told me that all the kids classrooms in Edgar that were facing the field when the first group of kids from the school were able to use it, had the teachers had to close the windows and the shades because the kids were so distracted about how jealous they were for seeing their classmates running out there before they were. But this is going to be a total game changer. I know we have. Hazel Ann is here from the board of education. I've spoken a lot to the board members and the superintendent about this. This is a borough property, but it's adjacent to the school, and it's always been the school's field. And that's. That's the kind of relationship that we have with the school district. I know the school district has been working very closely with the borough. The chief of police and borough administrator and I were out there for the groundbreaking for Moss school, which is the first of the number of projects that are going to be going on district wide. There's something going on in this town right now, and you can feel it. You can feel the energy. It's going to be some construction. You know, obviously, anybody who lived near Edgar Field for these last five or so months knows just how much, you know, patience you have to have when you're going through stuff like that. But ultimately, the end product is to better our community, and that's going to be the case with the schools. And, you know, we have another very important project that will be actually announced sometime next week, which we're really excited about. And, you know, I just. It's. Things are clicking right now on all cylinders in this place, and I really appreciate everybody's hard work because getting here isn't easy. And sometimes it feels like. Wait what's going on, what's happening. Suffice it to say to everyone in this community, there's lots going on. But sometimes things take a while to materialize. The hard work is done, often behind the scenes, not because anyone's hiding anything, but because that's the kind of work that's necessary to negotiate, to secure funding, to be able to ensure that this community's future is stable. And, boy, this place is flying. So I'm thrilled to be a part of it. And I know the council members are excited. Sometime next week you'll be hearing about what's really special is going to happen. So in one week, we're going to have, obviously, the exciting opening of Edgar, as well as a, another major exciting announcement that's coming, and stay tuned for that. With that being said, new business consent agenda Council president, I make a motion to approve the new business consent agenda, resolutions 2024 111 to 20240. Second all those in favor? Aye.

Council President Delia. Here. Mayor Bush. Here. Do I have a motion to open the agenda session? I make a motion to open the agenda session. There's been a motion. Is there a second? 2nd all those in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Agenda sessions open? Council president. I don't have anything today, mayor. Any council members? Anything? Okay, seeing none. Is there a motion to close the agenda session? I make a motion to close the agenda session. There's been a motion. Is there a second? 2nd all those in favor? Aye. Any opposed? It is over the agenda session, and we're going to move on now to proclamations, including one for National Library Week. And I see we have some representatives from both the Metuchen Library Board as well as friends of the Matouche Library. And I'm going to read our proclamation in favor of National Library Week. So whereas National Library Week, April 7 through 14, will be celebrated with the theme of ready, set library, and whereas, the Metuchen Public Library acted as a cultural, civic, educational, recreational, and lifelong learning institute, a welcoming space for the community and a source of collaborative literacy, community partnerships, while boasting 7883 cardholders, which represents 52% of our population of 15,049. And whereas, the Metuche Public Library provides programming, which brings our community together for entertainment, education, and connection through author talks, concerts, crafting classes, book clubs, story times, museum passes, summer reading programs, movie nights, as well as providing Internet access, technology supports mobile hotspots and literacy skill development. And whereas, our Metuchen Public Library in 2023 offered 910 in person virtual hybrid programs for children, young adults, and adults with 13,000 residents of all ages attending. Sorry, 1300 residents of all ages attended, we got a comma misplaced here. And whereas the hard working library staff whose goal is to make a difference in the community by providing positive experiences in learning activities and is supported by the board of trustees and the Friends of the Touchdown library, all volunteers and whereas the library board of trustees is instrumental in administering library services, improving, maintaining infrastructure, and advocating for local and state support, while the Friends of the Toucheon Library generate additional financial support for programming through an active calendar of fundraising events such as the annual book sale, the town wide garage sale, ten by ten by Hundred Art Sale, National Night Out, St. Francis Jingle Bell Fair get lit presentation, and the Friends membership drive all events which provided a $22,000 donation in 2023 whereas the estimated yearly economic value of library services to communities in excess of $4 million, which means that for every dollar that's invested in our library, $3.82 is returned to the borough, while the cost of taxpayers is just eighteen cents a day. And whereas, the golden touch and Library board of trustees and the friends of the libraries to connect through innovative and inclusive programs and services with the community at large, focusing on equity, diversity, inclusion and intellectual freedom, vital values to our Metuchen families. Now, therefore, I, Jonathan M. Bush, mayor of the borough of Metuchen, urge all residents to celebrate the valuable role our librarians, library staff and volunteers play in transforming lives, supporting families, educating our children, and strengthening our community of Metuchen. I encourage all residents to visit the public library to see for yourself. Ready, set library April 8, 2024. Signed by me. Congratulations. Thank you. You know, with that misplaced comma or decimal point, it's. I wouldn't be surprised if 13,000 residents of all ages attended your events. But it's incredible how, how much work you all do for our community. And in particular, tonight especially, I want to call our attention to our retiring director, Sisi, who has provided how many years of service to our community. 37.

You can come to the microphone for a second, if you don't mind. So you don't need to reveal your age, but 37 years, a really long time to be in one place in 2024, the fact that you're still here and you worked your way up through the system and became director is very inspiring, I think, to many of our staff within our ranks as borough employees, and you've been somebody really special to us. I don't know if you want to make some words, make some comments, the floor is yours. Cici. I would like to say is I'm very grateful. In the middle of New Jersey, I just picked Mattachan and have this opportunity. Give it to me and I was well be taken care of by the staff at that time. I was the youngest one and they just treat me like their daughter. And the community was so nice to me and I feel like I just love to come to Mataun, you know, I love the community, I love the people. A year goes by and I just never want to retire. I just enjoy what I do. I do have patron came to me. That why I always see you smile with a smiling face. I say I enjoy what I'm doing and I enjoy seeing you coming to the library. So actually I do invite you, all of you. If you live in Matouchean, come to Matoucheon library, get a library card. We'd love to see you. I think we'll really give a library staff a really boost, you know that councilman, or come here for a book or using our digital library resources. Yeah. And we offer so many programs and I think if you show up that will give the staff a great credit, give them so motivated to work more, to do more. And I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to, to serve the library and the Matouchean community and there is more to be done and hopefully my successor will be able to really work with the borough to get everything to provide all the meeting on the needs to the community and library users. Thank you. Absolutely. I think like CC, and we said, when you look at our staff and you look at the people who work in this place, whether it's our DPW or our police department, you know, our library, the people who end up taking the leadership roles are often people who have been in this system for a very, very long time. And, you know, that says something about working here, it says something about the administration, it says something about the previous mayors and council who've served this community, that people want to be here, they want to be in Metuchen. We end up recruiting very even despite the fact that we're a Relatively small town compared to the Salaries and other Opportunities in other Places, the fact that people choose to work in Metuchen means that there's a value to being here. So, CC, that you worked this many years in the system and then you chose to stay Here and that you rose your way all the way to the top, and then you led this library with incredible, you know, bold leadership. And obviously our library is one of the most respected in all of MiddleSex county and as a result, the state. So thank you. I know you're always there for my family and me when we need something. You've always been there for so many people. And the library holds a very special place in our community in particular. Thank you for all the years of service. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor Bush, for your support and the town council support of the library and for recognizing that it is a vital part of our community in this great town. And in honor of National Library Week, we're asking the town to please help the Friends fund the children's library's makerspace by raising $1,500 to go towards purchasing ab equipment, expand the wonder books collections, robotics and renewable energy kits to help enhance our children's and young people's education in the maker space. So you can go to fotml.org to donate. And we thank the town for doing that and for the continued support of all the volunteers that helped make the library so great. Thank you so much. Is there anybody else in the library before I come down and take a picture with you all with the reclamation that wants to speak? You're okay. Thank you for everybody's work. It's a team effort over there at the library. I know the friends work very closely with the board of trustees, and I know that it's hard, with limited resources to do what you do, and we appreciate it very much. So I'm going to come down there and take a picture, if that's okay. Seemed balanced here. Thank you, mayor. Mayor. Okay. Yeah. And also, just before we can. Is it about the library? Yes. Councilman Jamboy? Yes. I just wanted to say something. I know Cece just left, but I was never a liaison to the library at all.

Thank you very much. Anybody else on the library? Okay. Seeing none, we're going to quickly just. We have a proclamation for sexual assault awareness month, and so we're going to provide this to a copy of our to our clerk. I know this was something that the county suggested very heavily that we consider. And of course, that's on for tonight as well. Proclamation, which I'll sign and provide to our clerk to make this month sexual assault awareness month. It's something that's incredibly important. And promote the observation of Denim Day on Wednesday, April 24, joining advocates in support service programs and urging communities to help end sexual violence. At this time, we're going to open the floor to public comment on any matter on the minds of anyone who may be here. Anyone. Mike, is yours? Sure. This is your chance seeing? No, we're going to close public comment, move on to the municipal budget presentation. We have with us our all star CEO and CFO of this incredible company that we all run. Hi. Good evening, everyone. Thank you so much. Tonight we're going to talk. Last meeting was we introduced the 2024 Capital Ordinance. Tonight is the introduction of the 2024 proposed budget, municipal budget. I first want to give some thank yous and acknowledgements, first of all, to Mayor Bush and the finance committee, Jason Delia, Tyler, Kandel, Vanita Jithwani, and also former councilman Dan Hirsch, who was serving as ex officio. He just couldn't keep himself away from the budget. He just loves it so much and we're so grateful and thankful to have his eyes on it. So. And also, of course, my wonderful CFO, Becky Cuthbert, who without her numbers and knowledge and making sure that amounts beyond the decimal point are less. Inside joke. But anyway, let's get started. So we have, first off, this year we're proposing a municipal budget of 27.4 million. That reflects, it's actually a reduction from last year. And the major reason for that is the 5% down payment that we have to put into the budget for capital is less than it was last year because we had two significant projects, one the agrifield turfing, and also we proposed bonding for the $16 million emergency services center. So not having both of those significant capital pieces reduces, reflects a reduction. So we're going to a 1.5330 to a 1.5750 tax point increase for taxpayers this year with rounding allowances. And what does the budget rely on? It relies on 1.7 million in surplus funds, which again is a reduction from last year because we had, we supplemented because we had such significant projects that we had in the budget, we used a lot more surplus last year to kind of cushion things a little bit. We have $250,000 contribution that we receive every year from the parking authority, 1.5 million in state aid. 1.8 million from fees, permits, licensing, ticketing, court fees. That's all revenue source. 430,000 is allocated from the delinquent tax collection. 3.3 million is from grants, other sources. This is subject to change just because throughout the year we're applying, we don't really do anything official until we get the letters from the state, which come in sporadically then. So overall, 17.2 million is going to be raised through municipal property taxes. Of that, $1,029,515 will fund the library property tax. Okay, that's a formula that is state mandated and driven. This is the number that is allocated and it's based upon net valuation, taxable. Thank you. Okay, so what does that. 27.4 million. How is it allocated in our overall budget? Well, the largest portion is. Well, 29% is other, which Becky is usually. Then there's 6% that's reserved for uncollected taxes. 21% is public safety, 14% is public works, 8% is admin and professional services, 6% is debt. And I just target that to let you all know that that's a really good number in terms of how much is being allocated for debt. And that's one of the reasons why we increased our rating. What was it, two years ago? Our bond rating went up because to Becky's credit and to administrations prior, and now we have taken a conservative approach, and that definitely benefits us when we go out to the bond market and go out to do the significant investments that we're looking to do last year and even this year and into the future. And then 16% is pension, FICA, insurances. So that's kind of the pie we do the. It's not a really original presentation. Every year we kind of have the same slides, but it's kind of what everyone's used to. So I think that's a good thing. The next is 20 comparison of 2024 to 2023 salary and wages that increased probably about 377,000 appro", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Local Library", "insights": [{"observation": "Cece was very environmentally savvy, welcomed the shade tree commission and environmental commission, had dreams of doing a rain garden at the library.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Proclamation for Sexual Assault Awareness Month to promote Denim Day on April 24 and urge communities to help end sexual violence.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Mayor Bush and the finance committee worked on budget reduction reflecting significant capital project considerations.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Local Library", "insights": [{"observation": "Cece was very environmentally savvy, welcomed the shade tree commission and environmental commission, had dreams of doing a rain garden at the library.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Proclamation for Sexual Assault Awareness Month to promote Denim Day on April 24 and urge communities to help end sexual violence.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Mayor Bush and the finance committee worked on budget reduction reflecting significant capital project considerations.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 1013700, "chunk_end_time": 1537932, "base_url": "https://fb.watch/sqe0tVGmO7/", "chunk_url": "https://fb.watch/sqe0tVGmO7/"}, {"start": 14000, "end": 20000, "text": "that's reserved for uncollected taxes. 21% is public safety, 14% is public works, 8% is admin and professional services, 6% is debt.

Every year we kind of have the same slides, but it's kind of what everyone's used to. So I think that's a good thing. The next is 20 comparison of 2024 to 2023 salary and wages that increased probably about 377,000 approximately from last year. A lot of that is driven by our contractual obligations. We have two organizations, the police department and our DPW, who are teamsters, that are negotiated contracts that usually go for a four to five year period. Usually. Councilmember, just wanted to ask this, but just for everyone's information, the police department was overall 3% a year, and we are currently in negotiations. We went out of contract with the Teamsters at the end of December, so we're currently in negotiations with them. Hopefully by the end of the month we will have settlement. And it's been a good negotiation and. But we're contractually obligated with a lot of those salary and wage increases. Debt, 1.6 million from 1.5. That was only about 186,000 give or take. Healthcare costs also were. That was only 58,000 increase, which overall, especially with inflation and everything, we're doing pretty well with our healthcare programs. And that's knock on wood, because we're self insured. And then lastly, pension went to 2 million from 1.7. That's about a $245,000 increase. So where do our taxes go? Well, for a property that's taxed at assessed value. Now remember, it's assessed, it's not market value of $200,000. Estimated taxes would be about $14,524. That's an increase of about dollar 596 overall. So this is another pie chart which kind of allocates for a house of this size and taxes of 14,000. Where is your money going? So municipal public schools, about 8000, about $8,400 is going towards your Metuchen public schools. There was just a big referendum that was passed and they're going to be doing a lot of construction. We just went to a groundbreaking, not very, not maybe two weeks ago. And that's the largest portion of the taxes in New Jersey. Always go to your public education. Next is Middlesex county. That's about $2,084. The borough of Matouchean is about $3,100. And then the public library is $188. Okay. Year over year at the bottom just gives you the increase from last year to this year in terms of where we come up with the $596. Okay. And lastly, our general capital, which was the topic of my presentation last council meeting, we're looking at about 6.4 million. That includes our dot, it includes improvements. There was a whole host of things. I do believe that the presentation is on the website. If anyone has any questions related to what specific programming is. I didn't want to bore everyone again with that, reiterating all that, but certainly if you have questions. And our municipal aid and transit aid is about 1.44 million. So we'll go out to bonds and notes. We're going to authorize about 4.6 million, which is significantly less than last year. But that's because we don't have the Edgar fuel project and we don't have the substantial bonding that we did for the emergency services center. So that is the end of my presentation. Becky and I will entertain any questions you all might have about the budget. Thank you. I'm going to start off, I have a question about process, because these are the questions that we get from the community often, about the misunderstanding of where tax dollars come from. There seems to be a huge emphasis on the amount of money that the borough charges in taxes, because the other day, taxes are paid to the borough. Could you describe it? Maybe this is a little bit of a. For someone like you, Becky, who does this in your sleep when I've been doing this. How many years have you been here, by the way, doing this? 25. 25. Another homegrown. Yeah, another homegrown employee of ours. But could you give us a little bit of how a bill becomes a lawyer with respect to the way property taxes are paid and then how that allocates throughout the community to whether it be to the county or to the school board, for example, by percentage? Sure. The tax law in New Jersey puts the collection of taxes at the municipal level. We collect for county school and then local. In other municipalities, they may have more expanded, they may have fire districts, they may have dedicated libraries through their county, more open space, preservation lands. So we are the collection agency. We are required to turn over the full value of all of those other entities. The borough retains what we collect. The reason you see a number like delinquent taxes in a budget is because the way the statute and the law is written, we have to kind of protect. That's why you have the reserve for uncollected taxes at the end of the budget. That's why we have a delinquent tax. We then use the tax process for any uncollected taxes for this year. So eventually you get 100%. Collection just takes a little time, but that's the way New Jersey is structured. In general, 60% is generally dedicated to schools, and then you divvy down the rest. County and local kind of run close. So, in a nutshell, when you're at the end of doing all that, we collect the taxes, but only, and I think, and using this pie chart as my guide, 23 or so percent o", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Metuchen Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "We're self-insured and healthcare costs only increased by $58,000, which overall, especially with inflation and everything, we're doing pretty well with our healthcare programs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Year over year, pension costs increased from 1.7 million to 2 million, about a $245,000 increase.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "That's one of the reasons why we increased our bond rating... because we have taken a conservative approach, and that definitely benefits us when we go out to the bond market and go out to do the significant investments we're looking to do.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We went out of contract with the Teamsters at the end of December, so we're currently in negotiations with them.

So we are the collection agency. We are required to turn over the full value of all of those other entities. The borough retains what we collect. The reason you see a number like delinquent taxes in a budget is because the way the statute and the law is written, we have to kind of protect. That's why you have the reserve for uncollected taxes at the end of the budget. That's why we have a delinquent tax. We then use the tax process for any uncollected taxes for this year. So eventually you get 100%. Collection just takes a little time, but that's the way New Jersey is structured. In general, 60% is generally dedicated to schools, and then you divvy down the rest. County and local kind of run close. So, in a nutshell, when you're at the end of doing all that, we collect the taxes, but only, and I think, and using this pie chart as my guide, 23 or so percent of the taxes that are paid in property taxes actually go to the municipality. Is that correct? That's correct. We collect, but we disperse back to those agencies. And in McTouche's case, we also have a downtown district, a special improvement district. So we collect their full value and turn it over to them. Right. But that money comes from a separate source. That doesn't come from property tax. That's not other than the money that's in our budget to support the Metuchen downtown Alliance. Most of the budget for the Metouche downtown Alliance, or a percentage of the budget for the touch of downtown alliance comes. Most of it comes from the landlords or the businesses, if they own their properties and pay directly to the improvement district. Correct? Right. That's specific. That's an additional sliver tax. That's specific. In addition to your local county school taxes that those designated businesses pay. And we turn that sliver over for their operation of that government entity. The number ranges. I mean, it's just interesting because this year in particular, as a result of the referenda that passed, and the school district had three referenda that passed a year ago, November, for example. But it's interesting that this year, of the property taxes, 23% only, is actually ours. I mean ours, the municipalities, our governing body's responsibility to save and spend and wisely, etcetera. So that's interesting. Other comments or questions from members of the council? Quick question. Yes, council member. Thank you, mayor. I just wanted to make sure I understood just in the designation of. I think it was a previous pie chart slide of appropriations to admin and professional services. Could you just tell me what's included in that? Sure. What we have used in that piece of the pie is basically what it takes to run the regular departments of the town. So it's administration, it's legal, building, department planning, zoning, the small, the assessment piece, basically the clerk's office, the regular day to day business, things like recreation, library finance would be in administration as well. The library, the recreation that we kind of call in other. They are obviously services, but they're maybe not something you would get a permit due. A regular day to day business, so to speak. Okay, thank you. Any other questions from council members? Mister President? Anything? Yes, mayor. Just quickly. Number one, just thank you, Melissa and Becky, for all your work every year on this. This is like the most important thing that I think the council does and on a yearly basis is set this budget. It's not really a question, it's just I was looking over the tax rate schedule you provided to me before the meeting, and I'm just noticing that this year, the rate difference that we've gone up from 1533 to 15, it's actually the second lowest we've had in the last ten years, with the lowest being the COVID year in 2020 to. So it was just something, it jumped out to me when I was looking at these figures. Yeah, we've obviously honored the wishes of council and the best we can do for our residents is to be very economical, very careful, and very fortunate. Another point that we end up hearing a lot about from the community is the fact that we've had so many new rateables over the last five to ten years in this town. And people say with all this new tax, property tax being paid by the shopping centers and the apartment buildings and the other stuff that we've had here, why is it that our taxes keep going up? This is a fairly obvious question, perhaps for our CFO, but could you explain the situation? I know the answer, I think ultimately, is that our taxes would have to go up more to maintain services. But is there anything more you'd like to add to that? I think that you hit the key point that we are very like incremental and small in our increases, that it is spread over a larger base. That's what those additional assessments bring. It's also that they come in on a timing issue. So we do receive a benefit when an added and omitted comes in. Say, for example, on a new project that gives the town the lion share. Because on added admitted tax, you are not obligated to pay back to the other entities you collect for by statute, that's how that process works. So it does in some ways provide the opportunity to keep expanding our services in ways that we do and responding to our residents without having bigger increases. Great. Okay. Yeah. This is also just an obvious one too, but just for anyone watching at home, we had our first pilot payment in lieu of taxes at the Galton project that is not yet on the books and is not represented in this. That's correct. We have not yet seen those revenues. It could easily take another two years before those will come in and they will come in incrementally. That will be slow increase in. Right. And they'll come in based on when the project is done. It's based on the success of the project.

And I want to take the time to thank you both again and your teams. I know it's not just the two of you, but you're the spearheads. And you know, it's a big job. I know some of the conversations that I've had with our borough administrator over the last couple of months, how she's putting the budget together. There's lots of conversations throughout the borough, throughout all the departments. I know that you call in all the department heads and you ask them what their needs are and you filter some of the issues out, you figure out if everybody had everything they want, what it would be, and then you have to peel it back and figure out if someone could wait a year or two for particular equipment, for example. But at the end of the day, you pull this together in a way that makes sure it's responsible, that it's careful, that's deliberative. And I think that from my perspective, that's what we ask from you. And you do exactly that and more and present perspectives for me all the time that make me feel like I know we have the right people in charge. So thank you to both of you for your hard work on this project and everything you do. Very important budget's just about the most important thing we do. Anything else from you, Melissa?

Thank you. Okay. Thank you, councilmember. Councilmember Jonboy. Okay, I don't have a report for Shaytree because we canceled the meeting. I think everyone was away for spring break. I think I was the only one left. And tomorrow the senior commission is going to be meeting at 04:00 at the senior center. And then the following Wednesday, the environmental commission will be meeting. And that's my report. Okay, thank you, councilmember branch. Good evening. Have a report from the Matouchean Arts Council. I've been working on some great programming for this year. May 19, the Mignolo International Dance presentation will be on the plaza. And also May 19, chamber music with friends of the Matouche and arts at the Wesserhof School and St. Oh, I'm sorry. Friends of Touch and arts, Westheart School and St. Luke's Episcopal Church. So that's on May 19, June 8 and 9th Rise up Chorus will have a show, we all belong at the First Presbyterian Church. And August 2 will be an acapella group called Ball in the House. And that will be in Peterson park on Main Street. August 2. And one more thing, windows of understanding public art project. We always look forward to this. Every year there'll be a guided tour, hiking tour into the Peter Barnes Wildlife Preserve, and that will be on April 20. For all these things, please check the MEC website. That's it. I can give you more. No, you all get very decent sized reports tonight, so I didn't expect to go as quickly. So I'll just say this was a incredible week in the history of MeTouche. We had two major announcements and exciting events last Tuesday. Obviously, we had the governor. He came with the speaker of our state assembly to tour the forum theater and announce the new tax incentive program that's going to be helping and supporting cultural arts institutions throughout New Jersey, including, we hope, the, and expect, the forum theater. It was a really wonderful opportunity to showcase what could be in Metuchin. Just like, you know, there's a forum theater in Metuchin, but there's forum theaters, as I mentioned during the press conference, throughout New Jersey. And so the idea that our state and its leaders have decided that the concept of supporting the arts through tax incentive programs to keep New Jersey based businesses in town. So the idea with this thing is that they've been doing this for years, that New Jersey companies or New Jersey based companies pay for a tax credit. They pay substantial amounts of money for a tax credit, but for them, it's less than they would be otherwise paying. And the state takes that money and does something with it. This statute, which was adopted in December with our assistance and our people, our administration, helped write the statute, was designed to ensure that that money can go to community arts projects like the forum. And we made sure to describe the forum type project exactly in that statute. And so it's really incredible because, you know, while this process is an open one, and communities from throughout the state and nonprofits from throughout the state will apply for this if we get it, and we have no reason to believe we won't, considering that we were the site that they chose to tour, and we were obviously involved in crafting this very statute. You know, it will allow us to pay substantially for the entire project through this. And, you know, there are important pieces to this to be figured out still. But we are well underway and at the point now where we're going to be able to present to the community within some number of months an opportunity for public input, where we'll be able to discuss our plan for the theater. We already talked about the fact publicly as of Tuesday that this will likely be a flexible space, a black box, a space that can be used by everybody from, you know, someone who's performing a play to a concert to film, as the long tradition of the forum holds. And people talk about their film experience throwing popcorn at each other.

And people talk about their film experience throwing popcorn at each other. I keep hearing that story from people who grew up here and know it well and were there many times to, you know, events like, you know, dinners for public civic engagements for, you know, who knows, if wrestling on the plaza is rained out one year, you know, all different kinds of things. Remember, we passed the budget tonight, so you have so many opportunities for all kinds of engagement with our community. You could have conventions. This is a space that is to be used as often as possible by us. It will belong to us, to our community, and that's what this is about. And so we are going to make sure that the public purpose is the most directed piece of this. And we are driving and barreling towards a completion 2026. So this is really exciting stuff. And that happened on Tuesday. Then on Saturday, we cut the ribbon on Edgar Field, which was a labor of love for our borough administrator and her recreation team, our recreation department, our DPW. This was something that came together as a result of the fact that just so much demand for recreational space in the borough. And I think we all learned the value of recreation had we not already appreciated it during the pandemic. And it forced us to start to think about it in a more organized way. And so we put together Greenprint, which, as you know, is a vision plan that we, we proposed from a touch in active and passive recreation spaces. Already out of greenprint, we redid Myrtle. We have proposed, and I should say, have a plan for the completion of the Peter J. Barnes III Wildlife Preserve, a 32 acre wildlife preserve in Metuchen that will be able to hike and walk and bike on completed trails and have a bird watching tower and signage. It's just an amazing feat for this place. When that gets done, that's about two years, we hope. And then we've got, of course, Edgar Field, which is historically one of the most significant recreational spaces in the entire borough. It's the place where our Toucheon high school football team had some of its most famous games with Highland Park. Joe Theisman, the famous hall of Fame quarterback, played games there when he was from South river playing against. And it's really, it's something that has been used and used and used, and then suddenly over the years, it just has been harder and harder to maintain. And with Myrtle Field coming on, especially with weather related issues, Edgar became something that was used less often. And we were starting to realize that this was incredibly underutilized, the space. And when you have an underutilized space like that, you have to start to rethink it. And we did that. And I just came literally a minute or two late for this meeting. Thanks. Tyler called me to make sure I was still coming, but, you know, I was dropping my son and fixing him dinner after a late game because he's on the Edgar middle school baseball team. They had a game tonight at their own field, and the idea that they were playing in the shadow of their actual school is because of the work that our borough administrator and her staff and the council allowed her to do. So that's a huge deal that that project came online. It was as a result of a $2 million investment from our state and we wouldn't be able to do without them. So we had our state legislators, Senator Pat Dygdon and Rob Karabenchik and Sterling Stanley there with us today. We let them throughout the first pitch of the games that occurred there that day, which our teams do, I think went two and one on during, later throughout the day. So just. It's wonderful. It's great. It's got so many more opportunities. We're going to watch it breathe and see how it goes and what we need to do to increase it over the years. But at the end of the day, we are so proud of this thing and we have a wonderful, wonderful opportunity to move forward with two significant infrastructure projects that have come online. So with that, thank you to everyone for all your support this week and better things and more exciting things even to come. To come. More exciting than an earthquake? More exciting than an earthquake. And more exciting than a solar eclipse. Amazingly amazing. I hope everybody's eyes are still healthy after today. Nobody melted. Okay, let's move on. I'd like to make a motion to approve the new business consent agenda, resolutions 2024 132 to a 2024 141. Thanks. Is there a second? 2nd all those in favor? Aye. Anyone opposed? I make a motion to approve resolution 2024 142, authorizing the payment of the bill list in the amount of 4,000,245, $5,280.26. Thanks. Do I have a second? 2nd all those in favor? Aye. Any opposed? I'd like to make a motion to adjourn. Thanks for the motion. Is there a second? 2nd all those in favor? Aye. Anyone opposed? See you all at our next meeting. Thank you so much. Thanks again.

Thank you all for coming out on this balmy summer evening. And our new business tonight is going to be Chris explaining this new resolution for the planning board to consider, which we're excited to hear. I promise I won't put a time limit on this. I always fail. Regale us. What? You're amazing. For purposes of background, the board has received a resolution from the borough council as a redevelopment entity to authorize, or really the right words, direct the planning board to do an investigation as to whether the property designated as block 145, lot 78, also known as the Halsey street lot, the parking lot, will meet the criteria as an area in need of redevelopment with non condemnation, meaning no eminent domain in this case. So for purposes of background, you're familiar with the forum theater, that block face formed here, a thin strip of land associated with the University of Radiology, really thin piece of property, and the Jersey gas station property. Back in 2018, this board was directed to an investigation to determine whether those properties met the criteria as an area needed redevelopment with condemnation powers. It took about a year to get through the study, as well as through testimony, because during that time, the forum theater was privately owned. And just for concerns about the property owner and the borough's interest in trying to preserve the theater, they engaged the borough council engaged in discussions to potentially purchase the property at the conclusion of purchasing the forum theater. Then we finished the presentation in that 2019, and this board recommended to the borough council to declare those three properties as an area needed redevelopment with condemnation powers around that time, 2019 to 2020. We worked with Mailey Givens, redevelopment attorney, and this board and the redoubt entity to make the determination whether the entire municipality met the criteria as an area needed rehabilitation. So different designation through the same statute, through the local redevelopment housing law, but under rehab designation. But what this means is that the entire town is an area needed rehabilitation. But the forum theater, the strip of land and the gas station still is an area needed redevelopment. So that was in 2020. A few years go by, we started doing some planning discussions. What could we do here? And over time, you've seen that some homes across from the Forum theater have been demolished, some buildings have been demolished, and there's been some great interest in the borough to do something. So we prepared a redevelopment plan about a year ago that essentially utilized the area needed rehabilitation zoning designation to create new zoning for certain lots, including the Halsey street lot, as well as new zoning for the Forum theater, which could include renovation of the theater as well as some sort of food and beverage and support uses next to it. That's sort of the broad vision for the theater. But in 2013, we're thinking maybe it should be bigger. What if we include more properties and it's to really support the theater, housing and whatnot? That plan was already adopted again a year ago, put in place, and since then there's been a lot of interest as to the next steps. It's my understanding the borough has been discussing with potential redevelopers about what could happen on certain parcels. I understand the governor visited the forum theater recently about certain programs the state could offer, which I would assume the borough could potentially be qualified for to help rebuild the theater, renovate it, or what have you. And at the same time, again, there's been some interest about what to do with its properties. And with the Halsey street lot that's owned by the touch and parking authority, that's a lot easier to contemplate development since it's already, in a sense, has an easier way of dealing with the ownership, since in a way that we sort of have ownership of that property. So there's been interest in what to do w", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Forum Theater", "insights": [{"observation": "The borough is interested in trying to preserve the theater and engaged in discussions to potentially purchase the property.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The borough prepared a redevelopment plan that included renovation of the theater as well as new zoning for the Forum theater, which could include food and beverage support uses.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Halsey Street Lot", "insights": [{"observation": "Planning board is directed to investigate whether the Halsey Street Lot meets criteria as an area in need of redevelopment with non-condemnation.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Jersey Gas Station Property", "insights": [{"observation": "The Jersey gas station property was declared an area in need of redevelopment with condemnation powers.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Various Properties", "insights": [{"observation": "Some homes across from the Forum theater have been demolished, some buildings have been demolished, showing interest in redevelopment.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Borough Plan", "insights": [{"observation": "The entire town was designated as an area needed rehabilitation.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There has been interest in exploring redevelopment opportunities and potential state programs to support rebuilding the theater.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Forum Theater", "insights": [{"observation": "The borough is interested in trying to preserve the theater and engaged in discussions to potentially purchase the property.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The borough prepared a redevelopment plan that included renovation of the theater as well as new zoning for the Forum theater, which could include food and beverage support uses.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Halsey Street Lot", "insights": [{"observation": "Planning board is directed to investigate whether the Halsey Street Lot meets criteria as an area in need of redevelopment with non-condemnation.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Jersey Gas Station Property", "insights": [{"observation": "The Jersey gas station property was declared an area in need of redevelopment with condemnation powers.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Various Properties", "insights": [{"observation": "Some homes across from the Forum theater have been demolished, some buildings have been demolished, showing interest in redevelopment.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Borough Plan", "insights": [{"observation": "The entire town was designated as an area needed rehabilitation.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There has been interest in exploring redevelopment opportunities and potential state programs to support rebuilding the theater.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 7534, "chunk_end_time": 616282, "base_url": "https://fb.watch/sqdKNiigFZ/", "chunk_url": "https://fb.watch/sqdKNiigFZ/"}, {"start": 4000, "end": 10000, "text": "igger.

And with the Halsey street lot that's owned by the touch and parking authority, that's a lot easier to contemplate development since it's already, in a sense, has an easier way of dealing with the ownership, since in a way that we sort of have ownership of that property. So there's been interest in what to do with that property. And in this case, even though the Hallstatt street lot already is an area needed rehab and already has zoning through the reduction plan, the borough's interest is maybe we would have better flexibility under the area in need of redevelopment statute to potentially utilize the powers that are offered there that's not available under rehab designation. And in the grand scheme of things, not much difference between the two designation in terms of what can be done through rehabilitation programs or redevelopment planning. The only difference really, the really main difference is that under the rehab designation, you go up to a five year pilot, but under the redevelopment destination, you go up to a 30 year pilot. So essentially it's my sense that the borough is asking this body and me through as support for you, is to determine whether this property, the parking lot, meets the criteria as an area needed redevelopment with non condemnation powers. And if so, that may allow for the borough to add another tool to the toolbox for financial flexibility into any redevelopment agreement involving rebuilding that project. And it's certainly possible we could amend the plan that could be done with or without the redevelopment designation. But what this board is being asked to do is focus on can it, does this property meet the criteria as an area needed redevelopment even though it already meets the rehab designation? Trying to use that extra, you know, lens of study to be able to unlock the power of being able to utilize a third year pilot. And of course the borough may not even use it, but it's just there for flexibility. My sense, and I've done this in a few cases where you kind of jump from rehab to redevelopment if it meets criteria to have that leverage so that we can offer this to exact more community benefits, perhaps. So Chris, are you saying that the borough doesn't have anything specific in mind for the Halsey street lot? I would say it sort of does in a blanket statement, because we have zoning in place. Were contemplating housing on that lot with the parking structure, but I don't have anything further than that. I don't think the borough has named a conditional redeveloper. So it was still in the early stages. So I think the borough is looking for that additional flexibility. Are there any time constraints or limitations with the designation for redevelopment? Once it's designated, it stays that way until it's redeveloped. Then according to a plan of completeness and that designation goes away and the zoning is in place. Okay, so when we see a specific plan for the property, that redevelopment designation goes. Essentially the proper way to do the planning is once it's redeveloped to the satisfaction borough, then the designation. So once it's developed that you don't need that designation for that particular property. That's about two steps ahead though. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yet the code, the buildings we occupied done nothing wrong with. That's way ahead. Nothing wrong with planning ahead, but that's the next few steps would be the borough. Actually, we would ordinarily authorize Chris, but the borough has already authorized him to do a study to determine whether or not the area is an area in need of redevelopment. So at some point, presumably he will tell the board that he has the report and map ready, and then we would have to have a public hearing to determine whether the area is in fact an area in need of redevelopment. That is, does it meet the criteria? Then we would give a report to the mayor and council indicating that the area meets the criteria for an area need of redevelopment. The mayor and council would then have to adopt a ordinance to adopt a redevelopment area for the area. So that's, that would either they would authorize the plan planning board to prepare that redevelopment plan or it would prepare a redevelopment plan and then refer the redevelopment plan back to the planning board, which would then give its recommendations. Then it would go back to the governing body and the governing body would adopt an ordinance adopting the redevelopment plan. So that's basically the process in terms of timing for the study. Fortunately, this is one property, makes my life a lot easier. There's no buildings on the property, so it's probably very limited information once I ask for it. In fact, if I'm authorized tonight, I'm ready to start measuring the parking spaces. But I anticipate the report probably take a couple weeks and we'll probably have a public hearing in June. But don't hold me to that. I'm just thinking ahead. I think we want to move quickly, but given the fact that it's one property with no improvements on in terms of structures, it shouldn't take me long to do a study to determine whether it does or does not meet the criteria. So I guess one of the assumptions is that there's no need or desire to keep it as a parking lot.

Fortunately, this is one property, makes my life a lot easier. There's no buildings on the property, so it's probably very limited information once I ask for it. In fact, if I'm authorized tonight, I'm ready to start measuring the parking spaces. But I anticipate the report probably take a couple weeks and we'll probably have a public hearing in June. But don't hold me to that. I'm just thinking ahead. I think we want to move quickly, but given the fact that it's one property with no improvements on in terms of structures, it shouldn't take me long to do a study to determine whether it does or does not meet the criteria. So I guess one of the assumptions is that there's no need or desire to keep it as a parking lot. I guess more of a policy question, but I think it's clear through to redoubt and plan to read have in place a surface parking lot is not appropriate in a downtown area. And I know we talked about the Halsey street lot for decades. At one point, I think you looked at a parking deck in the 1990s and there was issues with that in the neighborhood. I think the boroughs come a long way, but obviously any, whatever is built there has to be compatible or at least form a good transition in relationship to the existing homes, particularly on Halsey street. So once you do the preliminary investigation, is it presented to the planning board or to the council? As Bob said, what the planning board has to do is authorize a public hearing at the serve notice two weeks in a row. So we serve, we have the public hearing. That's what testimony is given. I can be cross examined, you can cross examine me. And then what? A recommendation by resolution goes back to council and council could accept or modify the recommendations on the planning board. Thank you. There you go. I have a question. You said that the primary difference between this is a five year pilot versus a 30 year pilot. Is that what you said? Yeah. Under the rehab designation, the powers through the redemption planner or through the rehab programs, you can go up to a five year pilot that's not available under the area needed redevelopment designation. And so. But you also said that that designation. Excuse me. That designation goes away once the property is developed. So in terms of designation, the pilot still lives if there is one. Gotcha. And that's pursuant to any redevelopment agreement between a redeveloper and a borough. It actually only goes away in the sense that the redevelopment has been satisfied. But the redevelopment plan doesn't really go away. And the development that goes in there satisfies the plan. So it's not like it doesn't disappear. It's still the redevelopment area with the redevelopment plan. Yeah. The zoning still exists, but the designation really isn't applicable anymore. The plan will still exist and the plan essentially is customized zoning for a particular. Unless you redeveloped the redevelopment again. Yeah. Which could be another 50 years from now. I don't know. A lot and I don't know if this is relevant or not to ask what. I'm going to ask it in part of your investigation, are you looking at the amount of parking that, like, goes through the parking garage, for instance? Like, if that parking lot goes away, will there still be ample parking in, like, either the parking garage or street parking during the day? Like, my husband used to park there all the time. So I'm just curious. So my study would mainly look at, say, conditions of the property title ownership, obsolete layout, faulty arrangement design. It really doesn't go into how potential hypothetical development would impact other parcels. It really. It's just an analysis of the existing conditions as they are at that time. Got it. Okay. The only thing I'm really going to be, for example, I'm looking at is parking spaces. Is it too narrow? Is it meet code? Are the ADA spaces an appropriate number, and are they designed appropriately? Where is there access from the ADA to a place that's supposed to. Got it. Okay. And among other things, I have a question similar to that. So if we voted yes and then. And then down the road, a proposal came to us for what was going to be built in that spot. And at that time, would there be a conversation about having no more parking lot there and what that meant for the town? Like. Like once we say yes, then that means essentially, like you said, the parking lot can go away and something else could be proposed there. So then we're assuming to Liam's point, that we don't need the parking in the town in that location because we're almost giving permission for it to not be a parking lot. I'm trying to ask, is that confirming? Not at this point. Not this point. At this point, all that's being asked of the planning board is actually. It's not even asked so much is directed to conduct the study on whether or not the area meets the criteria as an area in need of redevelopment. That's this step. That's why I sort of. Maybe I jumped the gun by answering Ellen before. But then assuming that the answer to that is yes, and assuming that you make that recommendation to the governing body, and assuming that the governing body designates the area as an area in need of redevelopment, then it would have to either, as I said, either it or the planning board, depending upon what the governing body wants, would then develop a redevelopment plan. I'm guessing because the governing body appears to be driving this, that the governing body is going to authorize the plan and adopt the plan, but before it adopts the plan, finally, in other words, it'll usually introduce the plan and then refer it to the planning board for its a.

So that's the point where you would ask the questions of, well, where's everybody that parks, they are now going to park. So we're not forfeiting the ability to have that conversation down by saying risk could go out with this tape measure tomorrow. Correct. Just so we're clear, though, there already is a plan. I know, I heard you say that. Like a building with the parking structure, but then the parking structure has to work with the neighborhood right now. At that point, that's more of a site plan question. Yeah. Which is the third step after the zoning is put in place. But hey, we have to start somewhere, and now we know the sequence of events perhaps too well. Just out of curiosity, Chris, did town ever resolve its business with the property owner on the corner of the gas station? Is that still ongoing? I'm not privy to exact details. I'm going to have to defer to councilman Delia if he has any updates. Just out of curiosity. Still ongoing. Ongoing. Very good. God bless you for your patience.

I actually walked there this morning and they are up and down the entire section. You can't miss them. So please go when you're over there. Make sure to check them out, make sure you drive slowly in that area. We have parks and baseball and softball happening all the time. So thanks to the traffic transportation committee for all they do to keep that program going, as well as the Middlesex county, who is the, the sponsor of that program and gets us those stickers and those signs. And the MDA is going to be having their downtown love's moms event on May 4 from twelve to three. That's one they do every year and it's always really successful. And May 4 also happens to be Star Wars Day, so I think there's some Star wars themed things happening there, mayor, so you might want to be around for that one. I'd love that. He is locked in on that. I have him picking my son. What time is that? From twelve to three. I might be able to the twelve side of that. Excellent. That's my report. Thank you very much. Okay. Councilmember Candel. Yeah. Thank you. If an 85 degree day did not remind you enough, I will remind you that the early registration for the pool is now open. It will be open until and including May 15. So if you are interested in registering, I would do that in the next two weeks. And when you get to the pool this season, you'll see the improvements that have been made to the restrooms, to the showers, to the roof and the kiddie pool area. So we all look forward to the season starting and then with respect to the historic preservation committee we're only days away from May, which is National Historic Preservation Month. The Metuchen Historic Preservation committee invites Metuchinites to share in the celebration of Metuchen's historic properties by sending us a photo of an older home or property that you are proud of. Send photos that the committee can showcase in May on its municipal facebook page. You can send those photos to me@tcandellattuchin.com. thank you Mayor great councilmember Dilwani thank you. A library update first of all, just wanted to send our thanks to the Metuchen Arts Council and friend of Metuchen Arts for a very and to Middlesex county for a very successful cornerstone jazz series concert last Sunday, which had over 90 attendees. There were in fact 75 advance registrations and 72 people on the waitlist. So it was a really well attended, appreciated event. A couple of other upcoming items on May 4, there'll be a new gallery exhibit called Visual a celebration of graphic novel art and related to that, looking ahead a bit, we want folks to save the date for the library's celebration of graphic novels, an event which will take place on Saturday, May 18 from 1230 to 430, and more details will be available on the library website. Also on Saturday, May 4, there's a session for grades four through eight called introduction to AI at 130 at the library. So we encourage folks with younger kids to attend that. On Sunday, May 5 at 02:00 p.m. we'll have a talk called food is fuel by certified nutrition consultant Finza Akiwa. And this is in collaboration with the Metuchen Farmers market. And then finally, I just wanted to note that the library is very appreciative to the Matuchen DPW for repairs to the library's steps and to volunteers from the Garden Club of Metuchen and the Boy Scouts and Girl Scout troops who have assisted with enhancements and plantings to make the grounds look beautiful for the spring season.

It's wonderful to see our downtown and just inspiring to watch just people use this town the way that it's. And seeing it used to its potential. And today I, I happen to. Council member Judwani and I went to Edgar middle School to visit our kids class because they're in the same class and they having a discussion about leadership. And so we went together and we were sort of hanging out outside Edgar talking about some things afterward. And we just happened to be near Edgar Field and watching it being used today. So the first thing we noticed is as looking behind Bonita as we were talking, where teachers who in their break were using the track to sort of walk around and get their steps in, which was nice to see. And then, you know, as we're looking, the gym classes were coming and the kids started running around the field. And then I looked to the left and I saw the cones being set up. It's just wonderful to see the work that this council's put in come to fruition. And it's really inspiring again to see the community use this town and watching our community thrive. So just wonderful. And you can hear all the events going on, so really great stuff. And it's going to be a great summer and spring and summer in Metucham.

I encourage the community to express its heartfelt congratulation and recognition to the dedicated individuals who, through voluntary service, have diligently preserved, researched and shared the distinctive historical character of our locality since its upset inception. That was a long resolution. Proclamation May 13, 2024. Jonathan Bush, Mayor, the Burma Touchein. Congratulations. And we're lucky to have with us residents, volunteers, Edison residents as well, to talk about the importance and the work that's been going on. Some of the artifacts that they have with them today. I'll leave it to you. The floor is yours, Mister Sondergaard, whomever I don't. So I'd like to just introduce the board of directors first if you guys want to join me over here as I say your names, but. Tyreen Reuters. Lauren Masterbaum, Debbie Finley, Byron Sandra. Behind me, Walter Stolchell and Scott Thederbaum. And I'm Rob Kentos, the president. Oh, and Jerry Rice. Great. We also have several other members of the historical society who joined us tonight. Yeah, just get close to that microphone so everybody's. We also have members of the historical society that have joined us as well to show a massive support. So what we're going to do now is just kind of do a real brief take you through kind of what our archives are. So. And I kept. I wrote it down to keep it short. Good evening and thanks again for recognizing our 50th. I joined the historical society 26 years ago when we moved here and I'm still amazed at all the fantastic information in our collection. So I'm very pleased to, to share a small sample with you. Since this recognition is happening at a borough council meeting, we're highlighting some of the thornall items in our collection. We have literally thousands of photographs and artifacts in our archives room and storage unit. So we did have to narrow it down a little, as you know. Hopefully. William Thornall was Metuchen's first mayor in 1900. This was his official gavel. Yay. And the silk top hat that he wore. You don't have to put it on. I didn't commit to putting it on yet. I'm just holding it. Ok. All right. He and his wife, Jenny force Thornall, lived on a farm at the western end of High street about where Franco manufacturing's corporate headquarters are now. These photographs were donated by a person who found them at a Michigan flea market in 2011. They tracked us down through information we had published in our nanny Goats newsletter and sent them to us. So we have these fantastic pictures of Matuchen's first couple. Wow. Thornall ancestors were some of the first european colonists to settle in this area in the late 16 hundreds. A later ancestor, Benjamin Thornall, is credited with constructing the old Franklin schoolhouse across the street. A descendant of his, J. Worthington Thornall, wrote detailed histories of early european families in the area and is the one who donated his ancestors top hat. We also have all of his books. These bronze keys that are in this display case are from Robbins hall, which is where the first borough council meeting took place. I think the locks have probably changed since then, but they're quite fabulous. The Lindsay Woolsey coverlet that's down at the end there was made by other Thornall family members from Wool grown on their own farm, which was about where Menlo Park Mall is now. So every time I drive by the mall, I think about this coverlet. It was donated to us in 2014 by descendants who now live in Alaska and again tracked us down in order to preserve this artifact to save our past for our future. The foundation of our archives, however, is primarily photographs, many of them taken by J. Lloyd Grimsted. We just have a little photo of him. He took thousands of photographs in and around Metuchen in the 1930s and other years, including nearly every single residence, which is why a lot of people come to us when they're researching their house. He also collected histories and historical anecdotes. Importantly, he also made photos of very early photographs that he would come across when talking to early residents. So we have great copies of many of these early photographs that predated his. His own time due to his efforts.

Another item we've brought tonight is a red fire alarm bell down at the end from Franklin school. Not the one that's across the street, the old Franklin schoolhouse, but the large brick building on Middlesex Avenue in central that people remember. And here we have some photographs of the terrible fire that took place in the school in 1957. Many, many local residents still remember that day. There's lots more, but those are some nice ones that people can take a look at. Speaking of fire and emergency services, we've also brought a collection of medals and badges from the touch and police and fire departments that you can take a look at there up front. And also, and I'm going to hold this one up, a very large canvas reproduction of the eagle, hook and ladder building built in 1885. Bye. Thanks for coming. Better not be to school. Told you there's a lot going on tonight. So. Yes. So this is on Main street. People will recognize this building still. I think Rosen root is in there now. It's right next to Haley's. This was the building that was here before Haley's pub. Interestingly, this was. They were showing off their modern fire apparatus at the time. But this guy back here, you can kind of make him out. Has been identified as George Silzer, who later became governor of New Jersey. And he's wearing a top hat, which brings us back to top hats. So thank you very much for listening. We hope you will consider becoming a member of the historical society. Support to save the past and future. And everywhere we go, we have handouts. So please take some at the end. Thank you very much. Thank you for the proclamation. Would you like to take a picture with the proclamation with all the volunteers and board members? I'll bring up the hat and the gavel. And the gavel. Nothing. Picture. Just want that. But he's a bad person. Sideways. Sideways. There's so many people who probably want me to put that. This is the first thing. I don't look great in a hat, by the way, by 2024. But I really appreciate everything you do here. I'm a history nerd myself and a member of my family. Been a member of the Historical Society for at least a couple of years. Oh, yeah, we made you join right away. Tyreen has been. Is obviously the true history in this town. And a lot of you have filled me in on different issues that we need, because we're nothing without our own history. Right? So thank you for everything you do, and we appreciate continuing the work.

That's from four to six, and that takes place on the town plaza. It's always a great event. Come out before for the prom. There's pictures, there's usually a photo wall, all kinds of great, great things to get you excited for the prom. Out in front of Borough hall, we have a couple new bike racks that I just kind of wanted to mention and point out and thank borough administrator and the borough administration for getting put together and done. There's three of them. There's two of them, which are general U racks, which are the best type of rack for parking a bike. But then there's also a third, which has a decorative touch in sign in the middle of it. This is something that we saw, actually, when we were in Boston walking the seaport. We were looking for things to bring back home. And one of them was really decorative and interesting bike racks that they had there. Ours is a little more simple, but they're actually a little bit more usable because they're more simple. So that looks great out there. I'm looking forward to seeing more of those coming soon. And finally coming up during the new business consent agenda, we're going to be voting on a resolution to join Revolution New Jersey, which is a statewide program to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the United States. It's something that a number of communities in our area are participating in, and we're very happy to also be participating in that. And in addition to joining that movement, we're also going to be at the same time getting ready for the 125th of Metuchen. And that's a little teaser. And council member branch is going to have some more information for you during his report on that. And that's me. Okay. Thank you very much, council president, Councilmember Kendall. Yep. Thank you. In honor of May as national historic preservation, Monthuchin is taking an important step to promote its first nationally designated historic district.

So we encourage you all to come out to celebrate with progress towards a new firehouse. The Metuchen first aid squad has moved into the current firehouse. The the fire department and the first ape squad are looking forward to planning combined training scenarios as part of a final piece of estate grant. The fire department had their air packed decontamination machine installed. This makes our fire department one of the few in the area with modern equipment to fully decontaminate their gear and equipment after incidents with increasing cancer risks to firefighters. This is another step in ensuring their safety and health and health long term. The department's always looking for new members, so if you're interested in volunteering, please visit the website at www.mattuchinfd.com. and then finally, the early registration period for the pool is expiring on Wednesday, May 15.

And that's all I have. Mayor. Excellent. Thank you very much. Councilmember Hyman. Good evening. Thank you. The board of health worked with the street safety Commission. I'll let Jason tell you more about the evening with the street project film screening. But it was a wonderful presentation after a little bit of a technological delay.

"emorial Day parade will kick off on the 27th at 10:00 a.m. from the from Warnock street, go down Main street to the center of town, turn down new street and briefly stop at the plaza, but continue straight on to Memorial park where there will be a ceremony somewhere between starting between 1045 and 11:00 a.m. and that's it. Great. Thank you, councilmember. Councilmember John Boy. Okay, so last week the senior center held an open house for residents to stop in and check out the facility. It was actually very successful we had a number of people sign up and we actually had two sessions. We had a daytime during normal business hours session and then we had an evening session for those lucky seniors that are still working. And also you can come any day of the week between 08:00 a.m. and 03:30 p.m. during regular business hours if you weren't able to attend on that day. This Friday, Middlesex county is hosting a birthday luncheon for residents who are 90 plus years old and we are sending a contingent from our senior center to the luncheon. Happy birthday to all. Next Monday, Middlesex county will provide Covid shots at the center between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. walk ins are welcome. On Thursday the 23 May, the New Jersey Department of Motor Vehicles will have the mobile office at the senior center between 09:00 a.m. and 02:00 p.m. reservations must be made directly with the DMV and I'm sure that you can contact the senior center with more information or you can go onto the DMV website for more information on that and also membership format. Touch in residence is free so you can stop in and sign up and start enjoying all the activities and events that are going on daily. The Shade Tree Commission at their last meeting, had a discussion around the update of the community forestry management plan. This is the plan that the Shade Tree Commission uses to manage the tree population in the borough and it entails many things. It entails analyzing some trees that can come down that are deemed either unsafe or dead, plans to replant in areas and also tree species diversification, things like that. And also, some of the members are planning to walk the burrow to target areas that could be planted with trees in the near future to maintain our beautiful tree canopy. And the environmental commission will be meeting this Wednesday at 07:00 in Borough hall. And that's my report. Thank you very much, council member branch. All right, thank you very much. I'm going to do a little bit of a tandem. From council president Delia's update, we're starting to explore how we might go about having a nice celebration for the borough for its 125th anniversary. Myself, Mister Delia, and even Mister Mayor Jonathan and Bush just having some quick exploratory talk, so stay tuned for more. There's exciting things to come in another tandem coming from our council president. Speaking of biking, I did park my bike at the rack, Miss Perlstein. Thank you very much. So also biking Sunday, the mayor's bike tour will be. Where does this start? Originating and ending in Edison with a stop in McTouchen. So register to Edison recreation online portal. And Mister mayor, do you know exactly where it actually starts, or should we send people to the portal? The bike tour generally in the past years has started at the Edison municipal building. All right. But this year, the touch of mayor will not be participating due to his bad back. Okay, you can borrow by e bike. So that starts at 08:00 a.m. and other news from the recreation department. The fishing derby is this Saturday at Tommy's Pond from 09:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and that is free for kids up to age 16. The state Department of Wildlife and Fishing has given us some loaner, pole and equipment to use during the day, but the event is BYOB. That is b for bait. And I'm sure you can join. I'm sure they'll let you pull up 16. Oh, I don't comment on ages on microphones, so that is my report. Thank you very much, councilmember. A lot of things going on in the borough right now. The council members echoed all those things, but there's a couple. Tomorrow at 05:00 we are having the ribbon cutting for the new Conn's crossing bridge, the revamped Conn's crossing bridge, that rebuilt Conn's crossing bridge, which was broken about a month or two, I feel like after I became mayor in early 2018, which was really upsetting because it hadn't been built for that long, at least that iteration, the one that was called Conn's crossing, and, you know, we were really concerned about safety, so it was shut down. And then the amount of money it cost to rebuild it was so exorbitant that we had to go out for grants, and we were rejected for multiple grants until we finally got one that paid for it, which is really great. So tomorrow is the ribbon county, if you want to join us. I don't know what the weather's gonna be like at 05:00 tomorrow, but hopefully we're able to get this thing in, especially with some of the neighbors who for so long have been waiting for this to be completed. That's really exciting. And that's it for now. My report. I'm gonna move on to the new business consent agenda. Doctor, president. Thank you, mayor. I make a motion to approve the new business consent agenda. Resolution is 2024 160 to 2024 172. Thanks. Is there a second 2nd? All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed? I make a motion to approve resolution 2024 173, authorizing the payment of the bill list in the amount of $5,187,384.07. Do you have a second? 2nd. All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed? And to continue with the theme of what's old is new and new is old, I've got the current gavel, which different gavel that I started the meeting with to use here. Is there a motion to adjourn? May I make a motion to adjourn? Mayor, before we adjourn, the EMS came back. If they could maybe give their report. They came back. That's what the head nod was. I thought you were telling me nothing. Everything was okay. I'm sorry. We have a motion.

Okay, just name if you can, on behalf of the EMS. Good evening, mayor and members of the council. My name is Theresa Tomasco. My address is 77 Orchard Street. I am a junior at Keene University and I've been an EMT for 18 months. I just joined recently in February, Massachusetts EMS, and I'm here tonight to present the EMS report for spring 2024. We have taken 100 calls so far this year, which is about the same as this time last year. Also like last year, many of these calls have been in Edison. We have moved out of one safety place, and we are currently riding from the fire department across the street. And it has been working out very well for us. The fire department cleaned out a space for us and they have made us very welcome in their building. Our recruitment has been going well. All of our adult and cadet spend are filled, and we have enough emts to cover six nights a week. We have a waiting list of six college students, mostly from Rutgers. Recently we have recruited two new emts, and a more experienced EMT has returned. Two members will be leaving for medical school in July, and we will be bringing in three new cadet members in August. Besides 911 calls, we also support community events. Since our last report, we have covered a YMCA healthy kids event, the Easter egg hunt, the bike rodeo, and the Cub Scouts and Girl scout troops. If there are any questions, I will try to answer them. Thank you. Are there any questions from council members? Thank you so much for that. Miss Damasco? Anybody? Any questions? All right. Thank you for all the work you do. We appreciate. I think you know we appreciate it because we said it earlier. We're having a whole week to appreciate it by proclamation, but thank you for everything, and thanks for that. I absconded him the other night at our cares committee meeting, and he was incredibly helpful, full of information, even ran out and got materials for us and brought them back. So I want to say thank you for that. Okay. Anything else, councilmembers? I make a motion to adjourn. There's been a motion. This time it's not going to be withdrawn, I don't think. Is there a second? 2nd all those in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Fun meeting.
