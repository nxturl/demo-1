Deputy chiefs, would you like to come forward? You got two deputy chiefs tonight because Chief Reagan weathers at a fedation conference in beautiful Green Bay, Wisconsin tonight couldn't be here. He wanted to send his best and gave me a little thing he would like me to say for Doctor Vincent. Mental health. As we continue through the month of May, it is crucial to acknowledge its significance as national mental health awareness monthly. This month serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of nurturing our mental well being and fostering understanding and support for those facing mental health challenges. In the midst of our reflections, I'd like to extend my deepest gratitude to Doctor Carl Vincent for his unwavering dedication and support in providing assistance to our brave firefighters and police officers during their times of need. Doctor Vincent's commitment to mental health care for our first responders has been nothing short but of commendable. His tireless efforts have not only offered solace and guidance to those in distress, but have also underscored the vital role mental health plays in the lives of those who serve our community. In honoring national mental Health Awareness Month, let us not only raise awareness, but also extend our support and empathy to all those who may be struggling silently together. Through compassion and understanding, we can create a world where mental health is prioritized, stigma is eradicated, and support is readily available to all who need it. Thank you, Doctor Vincent, for your invaluable contribution and to everyone joining in this collective effort to promote mental well being and create a brighter, more compassionate future for all. With that, I'd like to give Doctor Vincent a little gratitude of ours from the fire department. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. We move to our proclamations. We have a series of them today. The first one is for international, excuse me, professional municipal clerks week. Thank you very much. And we'll share the sentiments with Miss Murphy as well.

Thank you, chief. Thank you, mayor and council. I certainly appreciate the acknowledgement of National Police Week. It's really a sobering day and week that nationally we recognize fallen officers. In the United States, the numbers aren't getting any better. In 2019, there was 50 officers killed. 20. 2047 by. And these are by gunfire. I'm sorry, 2021-6420-2262-2023-46 and already in 2024, there have been 20 officers killed by gunfire and 136 shot. That's 1% greater than this time last year. So it is a sobering reminder of the dangers that law enforcement officers face to try to keep our communities safe. They're just like you and I, your neighbors, your ball coaches, your pastor, leaders at church, various different things in our community, and they just choose to be police officers, and they put their lives on the line every day. And so I would like you, if you would please keep all officers, both in Molines Aquad City, region and throughout the United States, in your prayers and national police week. And thank you for the recognition of that day. Week. Thank you. One other area of our staff for the final proclamation.

Committee of the whole council and Executive session meeting minutes of April 23, 2024. Should have also said, and appointments made at committee of the whole on May 7, 2024. So what we are going to do is, of course, I've read those appointments, but we will wait to approve the reappointments at the 2020 1st council meeting so everyone can keep serving. It's not a problem. We'll just take care of it.

And unlike prior years, what we're doing is we're actually going through the approval process that is normally required. So that ensures that the proper placement of barricades takes place to secure and protect those who attend the event, because is a very well attended event. And with that, if Alderman Macias wants to say anything, obviously it's his ward and his neighborhood. And the same goes for the assistant city administrator. Not that they're neighbors or anything. Well, it's a really nice tradition that's been had for. I really. I don't think anybody else wanted started, but it's been decades, and it's just something that when we moved in, we realized what's happening, and everybody's always invited. Just a really neat parade. And I'm glad that we're getting it formalized. I did have one question. Should I also abstain from the vote? Did our legal counsel hear that online? Yeah, I'm part of this neighborhood. I did. And you may vote on this. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. All right, we need a motion and a second motion to approve. Second motion by Alderperson Macias. Seconded by timian. Discussion from council. Thank you for your preamble. That was not a hand. Okay. All in favor? Any opposed? That motion passes 9.2. A resolution authorizing the mayor and city clerk to execute and attest to licensing agreements with Ben River Brewing Company and Hoa Hotels LLC. Access Fifth Avenue syndicate for use of public right of way for an outdoor dining parklet installed by quality construction services from May 1, 2024 through November 15, 2024. Mister Vitas, Madam Mayor and members of council, we are looking for approval from you this evening to authorize the licensing agreement which will allow these two businesses, popular local businesses, Bent River Brewing Company and the access Fifth Avenue syndicate, to establish outdoor dining parklets for the time frame that's been described. Motion to approve. Reviewed by staff and approved. Recommended for approval. Thank you. Sorry, I thought he was stuffed up. Do it again. Motion to approve. Second. Thank you. That's me. I. Sen. Razak, discussion. Yes, Mister Timian? For clarity, have we needed council approval for this in the past? When we had the parklets for logo, Marsinos. And Tony's. And Tony's. And then cafe fresh. Cafe fresh. I don't recall ever doing this. I just don't know if we were wrong then, or if this is just better. I think they may have been in place before we took office. They actually were in place before you entered office and before I sat here. And they've been in place. So we had agreements with Arrowhead ranch and others to build them and put them up, dating back to when Jeff Manis worked in the administrator's office. So this is just formalizing that approval process. Thank you. Unless Chris has got something to say. Anything. Anything further from the council hearing? None. All in favor? Any opposed? That motion passes 9.3. A resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a junior achievement of the heartland. J A Biz town sponsorship agreement between the city of Moline and junior achievement of the Heartland to sponsor and have access to a storefront in Ja Biz Town inside the Junior Achievement Inspiration center, located at 6644th Avenue, Moline, Illinois. Mister Vitas, mayor and council, we wholeheartedly support what junior achievement based here locally is going to do at the vibrant headquarters property, the former Sam's club, and relocation of Biztown from its long standing location in downtown Davenport to the city of Mole. So we're looking for approval of the sponsorship agreement, which will span the next three years. And this specific project has been assigned to Macy McManus for the design of the interior of the city hall in Biztown. Motion to approve. Second motion by Schmidt. Seconded by Castro. Discussion hearing none. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? That motion passes. Thank you. 9.4. A resolution authorizing the mayor and city clerk to execute an attest to a contract with five cities construction company for project number 14 2024, sidewalk infill program for the amount of $211,030.18. Madam Mayor and members of council were looking for approval for the award of this contract to five cities construction company for our sidewalk Infill program, which is a budgeted program. The budgeted amount of that program is actually two, $200,000. The reason why it would then appear here, based on our policies, is that it exceeds by $11,030.18 that which was budgeted. So that would come from other sources within the budget, and we're recommending approval so we could begin this program. It'll also appear later as a non consent item. Move to approve. Second motion by Timian. Seconded by Castro. All right, hearing none. All in favor? Opposed? A motion passes. 9.5. An ordinance amending chapter four, alcoholic liquor.

I believe that the city attorney is. There she comes. All right, here I am. Do you like have a preamble? I would like to say that we did. As my memo informed, we prepare more information based on your questions and comments from last time. We also amended this proposed ordinance so that class A licensees will buy this option, which, by the way, will we are proposing, would cost $500 a year. They can sell any sort of packaged alcoholic liquor with that option. We kept in the other restrictions or limitations, which include that these sales have to be in conjunction with other sales or events, that they still must meet the definition in the code of a class A license holder, which means that sale of food has to be more than 50% of their revenue, that they cannot have packaged liquor displays, and they are restricted to the hours of service or sales, same as their hours of service as a class A. And of course, the reason, as I stated in my memo, is to maintain the integrity of the class A license. Okay, thank you so much. We need a motion and a section to. What was that? We have to take it off the table. Oh. Motion to remove this item from the table. Second. All right. Thank you, Mister Timmy and Mister Schmidt. That is correct. All right, discussion. We've gotten our questions answered. Mister Schmidt. Yes. No, I appreciated the additional insight when we started talking about how it was going to impact that longer business piece. I just needed that refresher. I also think that we do a better service to places and allowing them that flexibility of along all liquor types. Not limiting it, just because whenever we can make that simpler and easier for all options and opportunities, I think that's a better choice when it's not going to cause any problems. So, thank you. Thank you. If there's nothing further, all in favor? I think we need a motion. I believe we need, actually, a motion. Have we voted on the motion to take it off the table? No, we just had discussion. Thank you, Art. So, first, just to clarify, so we don't have any more questions, we vote to take it off the table. Then we can have a motion to approve and discussion and. Got it. Okay. Right. Thank you. All right, so if there's nothing further, all in favor of taking it? Oh, wait. Removing from the table. Do I have to do roll call? Yes. Thank you.

And Chris, what time is that being held? 245 03:00 is when the main presentation will start. Yeah. So if you want a seat, if you want to see it, get there early. But they're going to unveil basically what is the synthesis of big idea one, big idea two, big idea three. And it is quite interesting. I will say that. I'm not saying that that's what the final plan will look like because there's still community engagement to happen, and then there's council input, of course, which will lead to the final plan and the costing of that plan. So really exciting. That project is on schedule and going very well in the world of it. David Rohat and his team, working with all of the different departments, all twelve, did a city website redesign. And so it's up. It's running, like all things, website orientated. We will continue to refine, but it is a much better product than we had before and more in keeping with the standards that you see that other local governments do use across the country. The real advantage here is that before, we were kind of locked in in terms of what we could or could not do. This system allows us the flexibility to make modifications we could otherwise not do, and I would be looking for updates to each of the department pages as we move forward. HR has been busy, obviously, not only in terms of hiring people, but with promotions happening throughout the city. We are an employer of choice. That's fairly obvious based upon the lower number, actually of vacancies as compared to when we all got here several years ago. We've arrived, I think, through your guidance and through your support across the boards with salaries, benefits and just creating an environment that people want to be a part of. So going very well in that respect. And last but not least, I'd just like to mention the library gardens project. Truly exciting. What started out as a house and a garage and a lot next to the library on an acre demolished. Property acquired by the city demolished. The buildings demolished by our park and parked by our park and public works department workers. We now, and with the design work of Shive Hattery, we have a really great project going forward. There will be an official groundbreaking. Everybody will be invited to that. And that is during the month of May, right around the time. One thing that's not on this newly completed items list, but I'm going to put it on, is the swimming pool. We are about to open up the premier swimming pool, in my opinion, here in the Quad Cities, Riverside Riverside will open as on a soft opening for the city employees two evenings before the official grand opening. And then the following night, there'll be another soft opening for the YMCA members as well. So that we can actually make sure our employees, both lifeguards and our concession staff and other parties that work with us are prepared for the onslaught. I am talking to Eric during our directors meeting today. All of our reservation nights are booked solid for the whole year. Pre soldier summer season is sold out. Those Sundays are sold out. So we have a really great product to deliver to the citizens of Moline, first and foremost. And for those who live in the Quad Cities, especially those in Bettendorf, who, like us, got delayed because of the lack of state inspection. So we will be open and come join us. Love to see you all there. That's it. Thank you. Any questions for Mister Vitas, Mister Macias? Thank you. Just a comment. This is very ambitious and I see a lot of things really rocking and rolling. So thank you and all the staff for getting all these things going. And in particular, I love the fact that we have the numbers for some of the housing inspector, the rental housing inspection, the program is up and running. I'm kind of surprised because just a couple months ago I met the individual who was doing this and seems like he's up and running. So again, I commend you and all of the staff. It's really a very ambitious plan and you guys are doing a great job. Thank you very much for that. And I'm sure the staff that's here appreciates it, those listening appreciate it and those who aren't, we'll let them know. Thank you. All right, if there's nothing further. We'll close out this meeting and call our regular council meeting to order. Pledge of allegiance. Please pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, and liberty and justice for all.

Oh. Three definitions and amending article three, zoning division four, land use Regulations, section 35 3401, regulation of allowed uses, table 35 3401.1. Permitted land uses and amending section 35 3411, accessory residential land uses regarding zoning. Text amendments concerning accessory dwelling units. Motion to approve second motion by Timian. Seconded by Macias. Discussion. Yes, I think that. Go ahead, Miss Murphy. Yeah, I'm sorry. I believe that this last week, since we voted last, several questions that come up about the present AdU and how it's written and how it addresses emergency addresses, how it deals with covenants for neighborhoods like Wildwood and greater, I think Oaks Tardian, just to name a few. And the other discussion I think that we need to really think about is the minor versus major. I can't remember exactly what. Structure. Structure, yes. Yes. How we're going to deal with the parking. And if I remember correct from what I read, is that there's going to be. You can have the business in your backyard as Adu. Also one in your basement. So one resident could have two different Adus, if that's what I understood. And there's no additional. I think it's. There's no additional places for parking for that either. So can I ask Mister Matthias to answer the question about the how many Adus are allowed business wise? You answered the question last time about business in general. One Adu per lot. And the way the code reads now would treat an Adu like a house, or you could have certain limited in home businesses in the Adu, just like you could another dwelling, only one Adu per lot with the soil. But you could also have ADU in your basement or a business in your basement and an ADu in your backyard. No, not by this ordinance. You'd be limited to one or the other if your lot was big enough and met all the other criteria that would allow the ADU in the first place. Okay, thank you. Thank you for your thoughts. Others? Yes, Miss Castro, can you clarify the question regarding if an HOA has a covenant that restricts the Adus, does that supersede the ordinance? The city would not enforce any covenants for a private covenants for a subdivision. The city would not be enforcing those, so I wouldn't. Yeah, so there's no, the law of the city is the law of the city. Somebody may have a private issue with their HoA if they choose to do it. If they choose to initiate an ADU so they can have it. So they can have it, we just wouldn't enforce it. It would be up to them to enforce it themselves. By legal action generally, yes. The only caveat I would put on that is if somebody came to me with an application for something and I knew ahead of time that this was a violation of those covenants, I would rely on my legal counsel to help me with that matter at that point. But based on what I'm telling you now, like I said, we usually would most certainly would not enforce private covenants, but it may affect us signing off on a permit. I would work with our attorney in regards to that. Okay, thank you. Any other questions, Miss Merkel? So how would the city handle the litigation? Who's gonna pay for that if we do get into a legal battle with the homeowner or Hoa over Adu? Like I said, I don't think we'd be getting into the legal battle. We've had discussions on this with, like, members of our plan commission that actually have had that happen. That's their legal battle to fight for the most part, yeah. To clarify, you're saying a resident going against their HOA rules would have the issue with them, not with the city, if that's not our issue. Correct. And that would be their legal fight, their legal expenses because the city wouldn't be the one coming in to enforce that. Miss Kostopoulos, would you like to comment on a legal. Yes. To simplify that. Well, in a homeowners association which has a restrictive covenant with property owners, which prohibits adus. The way that that would work is that while those individual homeowners may be eligible for a permit to or develop an ADU by city code, they are still nonetheless bound by the HOA agreement, so that we would not have any issues in that conflict. So while we could, as Chris said, we could issue that permit, but it would still be in violation of the agreement as a homeowner in that HOA. So it would be a private civil matter between the HOA and the individual homeowner to litigate or ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Unknown Company", "insights": [{"observation": "So one resident could have two different ADUs, if that's what I understood.

So it would be a private civil matter between the HOA and the individual homeowner to litigate or work that out. Thank you. Any other comments? Yes, Mister Schmidt, I wanted to just express that I find the concept or idea of the city getting involved in trying to enforce someone's covenants to be something that it's just so not on the table or any point of conversation. I mean, that would be us selectively stepping in to say we're going to enforce certain private contracts. We wouldn't do an HOA covenant any more than we would do an employment contract or a private sale item. That's just not our space. And I think it's frankly, an argument that's being made, I think, in bad faith. I have spent a great deal of time over the last several years since this issue. First was before council, seeking out input from people across the city. Overwhelmingly, people are in support of wanting to move forward. And in fact, most people I've talked to have reacted and said, I can't believe we don't have that already. This is a point where I think it comes down to whether we want to propose and support what someone is able to do with their own property, or we want to be able to control by outside forces what people are doing with those property. And I think we do have a responsibility to set some of those boundaries. But the limitations are currently, as they are, are not right, and I very much support the passage of this ordinance. Thank you. Was there another hand? Yeah, I just. I just had one more question, as far as addresses. Will the adus have separate addresses, or they have the same addresses as the home that's currently on the lot? In my opinion, they will have to have their, their own address. Just from an ambulance standpoint. I mean, the most important thing about an address is where's the person that needs help for an ambulance, police officer, or those type of things. So I don't have the code section in front of me, but my opinion would be they should have their own address. Thank you. Anything further? Yes, I just want to say that's number two, I've given you both signals for number two. I should have said at the beginning, but go ahead. Okay. I just want to say that in response to what Alderman Smith said, well, obviously there are a lot of people the taxpayers are still confused about because I've had a lot of calls. A lot of people still think that the 2022 ADU ordinance is what they're, that we're voting on and not the changes. They don't understand the changes in what we're putting out now. So I don't know how many people you talk to, but there's still a lot of confusion out here with the public and the taxpayers of what we are doing with Adus and what actually is on the table. Thank you, Mister Macias. Thank you. I would say I've received emails, but I also feel there's a lot of misinformation out there pertaining to these. Not so much. We did a lot of the meeting with the folks and there was also some disconnect with some folks where they assumed one thing and it really isn't, or just assume a lot of assumptions like what's going to happen if this, that and the other happens and they get into these stories pertaining to a certain neighbor they live with next to or whatever. But the reality is, if you read the stuff on here and if you talk to people who have a general understanding of how this is really not going to have a huge impact, it really just makes sense that it's just another option for our residents to have if they choose to basically either create one move in with a family member. There's just so many life scenarios that this can benefit our residents that I would just hate to impede it and basically not address it. This really hasn't been addressed and other cities and municipalities have done it. So we just, just need to get on par with that. Thank you, Mister Mirza. What I have been experiencing that I do definitely agree with Marcias, because there are a lot of unrelated thing coming to this agenda. People are not doing enough research because what they are claiming, what is their claim and what actually city is doing are two entirely different position. And this is the, I would say that this is the residents responsibility to know, to understand the correct information. The issue over here, they are not focusing on that particular issues, they are focusing something else that is very unfortunate. And I will, that this will definitely help a large community who has the right to live in a house. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mister Timian. Thank you, your honor. I want to thank members of the council. We reintroduced this in December 12 of last year, the plan commission, we had five meetings about this, which was a lot of discussion.

So I just want to thank you all for that. Thank you, Mister Schmidt. There is one piece, as we look at the concerns and everything as we approach these, is the idea that it's going to turn over into an excess of rental properties or move us in that direction. And I think that what we have set out in requiring the owner occupancy will solve for that problem. And it also solves for a lot of the other problems that are going to be hypothetically thrown out, on the edge cases. Because I think that, as we remember that it is going to be, people are doing this in their own home. And by putting this in, goes from simply being able to do it for a select number of family members to also being able to support yourselves from the additional income to either to stay in your home or to downsize, or just to have that additional income when you have the room and the space and the opportunity for it, which is really a net positive. But I think that owner occupancy is going to be the biggest safeguard. And I think that is also why a lot of the concerns are not something that is rising to the occasion to me and to most people I talk to. Anything further from the council?

Attest to a contract with five cities Construction Company for project number 1447 2024, sidewalk infill program for the amount of $211,030.18. Motion to approve. Second motion by Castro, seconded by Timian. Discussion. Yes, Mister Ozak. Sidewalk is very important for our residents. When we come out from house, we do not step on the street. We step on the sidewalk. So my understanding is that we are putting less important on sidewalk, more importance on road. So I would like to. I am requesting everybody to reverse it. Okay, so. But you would admit that by actually voting for this, we're prioritizing. And just to clarify, this is something that we already do prioritize. Like it's been in the budget for several years. I can wait. We can't. I'm sorry that my. I don't know if I'm too hot or what's going on. Did we motion and second this? Yes. Thank you. So we are discussing. Lord have mercy. Okay. Mister Vitas has some ideas, ideas about how to prioritize that for the future. So he's on that same page with you. Let me just share that, if I might, because I think it's important to hear it now, even before we get into the CIP planning sessions in June is that we do have sidewalk programs, infill programs where there are no sidewalks to fill gaps, especially around the schools. I mean, that's kind of been the city's priority. And then reaching beyond the schools, of course, there's still a need for infill. And if you walk the city, you'll find where the sidewalks are missing. You'll end up on the street. It doesn't take much. And I know Barb's waving her hand. She pointed out quite a few at the ward one meeting, and we're looking at every one of those. But I think the other issue is, again, you've got the roads, and those will always be a focus and our utility, but you also have old sidewalks. And the question is, where should that priority lie? And if I was to ask different people this question, I might get a different answer. If I was asked our insurance company, they would say repairs first, infill second, guaranteed. Because a trip and a fall and an injury probably results in a loss. And we are self insured. To a degree. So as we look forward to our June sessions, I want you to be thinking about that. Because as you walk through the city, especially the older wards, you're going to find some very dilapidated sidewalks that present great risk.

But then as you walk the sidewalks, you start to see where we've, you know, where we in the past would fix broken slabs and then leave the older slabs. And now the older slabs caught up with the ones we replaced. So it's hit and miss. So I think. I think David Dreier, I know he's probably listening. I am. I guess you were, David. But I think we could look at reprioritizing that as well prior to infill. And that would be. Be my recommendation, actually. Mister Tamir, did director Dreier want to say something? Dave, do you want a comment? No, I agree with you Bob. I was trained by an old city engineer who said he was never sued by a sidewalk he hadn't built. So there is something to be said about maintaining what you have as opposed to new. At the same time, there are many segments of sidewalk that are employed. Important linkages in the system that should be completed. And we worked with complete streets on that. The ward one meeting that we had recently, a number of sidewalks that were failing, that were brought up. And we're working to address those as best we can. And then there are new sidewalk segments that were identified which will be taking to complete streets as part of future budget requests. So I agree. It's good points. Good discussion Mister Timian. Thank you, your honor. I just. As a member of complete streets, these two segments that we're infilling are close to schools. And that's where we targeted 31st, sorry, 33rd street, right by the high school. Obviously that whole section town doesn't have sidewalks. And so we've been systematically hitting them one year at a time, trying to spread it out. And the other segment hits Alderperson Schmidt's neighborhood where there was a lot of school aged children walking to Roosevelt or to McDonald's or a lot of things there. So these are way overdue and I think well needed. And I appreciate the approach this year where we were just hitting two big projects instead of 20 small ones. We're getting a lot of bang for our buck on these ones and I'm just glad to see these happening. And moving anything further from the council on this item hearing, none roll call, please.

All right, just in moving to Ms. Lenny's business, I want to update you on a couple just interactions recently. One, I'm proud to say that moline has been recognized as a 2023 Tree City, USA and received a growth award from the Arpadae foundation. So that's wonderful, and congrats to our staff. Please pass that on for making that happen along those lines of the environment. For some time, our enviro working group had been trying to get us to get some more sustainable utensils and things like that in our joint purchasing through bi state regional commission. And finally, they are gearing up and working with the city on a survey of all of the other towns to try to get more of that. Because as we knew from, I think it was 2021, we got the data back that single use plastics is the biggest pollutant in our water system. And so, however, we can move our communities to use fewer of those single use plastics will improve our water quality and what have you. So that's exciting that we're actually getting to a place where we might be able to shift over through our joint purchasing agreements, which help us buy things at lower cost. Along the same lines, I did have a meeting today with representatives from the Prairie Rivers network. They work on all kinds of climate things, and they finished a community climate assessment that they wa", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Our enviro working group had been trying to get us to get some more sustainable utensils and things like that in our joint purchasing through bi-state regional commission.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "As we knew from, I think it was 2021, we got the data back that single-use plastics is the biggest pollutant in our water system.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "However, we can move our communities to use fewer of those single-use plastics to improve our water quality and what have you.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Moline has been recognized as a 2023 Tree City, USA and received a growth award from the Arbor Day foundation.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Our enviro working group had been trying to get us to get some more sustainable utensils and things like that in our joint purchasing through bi-state regional commission.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "As we knew from, I think it was 2021, we got the data back that single-use plastics is the biggest pollutant in our water system.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "However, we can move our communities to use fewer of those single-use plastics to improve our water quality and what have you.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Moline has been recognized as a 2023 Tree City, USA and received a growth award from the Arbor Day foundation.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 2848740, "chunk_end_time": 3269942, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmsGmyS3HQw", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmsGmyS3HQw&t=2848s"}, {"start": 44000, "end": 50000, "text": "hose lines of the environment.

Along the same lines, I did have a meeting today with representatives from the Prairie Rivers network. They work on all kinds of climate things, and they finished a community climate assessment that they wanted to share with me for this whole quad city area. I'll keep this on the table in my office if you would like to peruse it or if you want to get your own. It's Prairie Rivers network. You want to reach out to them. But they were very interested in partnering on projects. This is not the same organization as the Clean River Advisory council, but they do talk to one another, so they're not, you know, repeating things and depleting resources, etcetera, for folks that want to work on this stuff, but they know of dawn. I talked about some of the things we have been working on. They knew about our solar project already ready. So just another partner in the area. They're based out of champaign, but there's a local office, a couple people as well. So that's that. And then just a thought to let you know, as you saw in our emails this weekend, you know, our police department was quite busy dealing with violent related issues in the city. And I just wanted to communicate to the council that I take our partnerships and the partnerships they have with people in the city partnerships very seriously. And the chief and I have talked about engaging with youth previously, and I just wanted you to know I'm going to continue to talk to our youth commission about doing more than passing out checks for programs that they really need to partner with. A lot of the folks that I've talked, talked with over the course of time here who have spaces and want to create youth programs. So I just wanted to let the council know that those conversations are being had. And I appreciate all the work that's been done to communicate so far and all the work your staff has done. As you noted, it was a very busy Sunday, so we thank them. That is all I have, Miss Murphy. I have nothing. Okay, I'll smooth. Thank you, your honor. Just a reminder, Tuesday at 06:00 p.m. it'll be the second ward meeting. We'll have our staff there. David Dreyer, Denver. Brad Hallman. We're going to have quite the representation from the city. So if you live in the second ward, stop by. I even had somebody from the third wardrobe that wants to visit because they live so close to the second ward. And so, yeah, just hopefully we get a good turnout. It's at Mercado on fifth in the building. So thank you. That's it. Mister Rosak? No, nothing here. Or not. Mister Timian, I would like to remind council that this Thursday is the neighborhood meeting. Oh yes. And that will be 09:00 a.m. and the community, the whole meeting, this happens once a month or or so where the leaders of all the different neighborhood groups get together and just discuss strategies and plans. Whether it's block parties or cleanups or just different programs that they engage in. Alderperson Mistias will be presenting. So if we attend, we can't really say much, but it's always a pleasure to be there and to network with members of the different neighborhood groups. So I encourage you to attend if you can. Thank you. Mister McNeil. There's an east end neighborhood cleanup this Saturday, seven to 11:00 a.m. so if you're interested in coming down and helping out, first go to public works to check in. And they've got bags and gloves and everything you need. Thank you. Miss Castro. Nothing. Aaron. Mister Schmidt? Nothing. Your honor. My turn. So just very briefly, looking back over this evening's meeting, and I know it was on the consent agenda and some people attended. So congratulations on the dear Wyman house being actually now officially plaqued. And that's really wonderful news for that property and all you do there and all the visitors that we received. Tourists, very important tourist destination here in moline for not only us, but for those who travel to the area from far, far away places. Secondly, I'm looking into the audience and I see Alex is here and I see Pete McDermott is here and I want to thank both of them. One is the sale of the property to allow for the green space necessary for the daycare, which is part of the JC Penney project, would not be possible without that. We needed the green space. So thank you. And I want to thank Alex in particular for all the heavy lifting she did. You know, she doesn't like accolades, but I'm going to make sure she gets them tonight like I did at the par instrument groundbreaking. She is a true right hand to the city. Ren Nu is a true right hand. I think without them it would be much more difficult to get things done around here, especially the economic environment that we find ourselves in is very challenging. So she stuck to her guns. And if it wasn't going to be JC Penney, there was a different building. It started somewhere else on Fifth Avenue. She kept it on Fifth Avenue, just moved it a few blocks to the east to say, we're going to see some residential development there with our new partner, Busch construction. So thank you very much. And with that, and, of course, Chris, you came late to the party, but, you know, you held your own and you made it all c", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Bi State Regional Commission", "insights": [{"observation": "The enviro working group had been trying to get more sustainable utensils and things like that in our joint purchasing.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Single use plastics is the biggest pollutant in our water system, and efforts are being made to move communities to use fewer of those single use plastics.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Prairie Rivers Network", "insights": [{"observation": "Finished a community climate assessment that they wanted to share for the whole Quad City area.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Interested in partnering on climate-related projects.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Police Department", "insights": [{"observation": "Involved in engaging with youth and creating youth programs as a way to tackle violent issues in the city.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City of Moline", "insights": [{"observation": "Holding neighborhood meetings where different neighborhood groups discuss strategies and plans, including cleanups and block parties.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Public Works", "insights": [{"observation": "Organizing neighborhood cleanups and providing necessary supplies like bags and gloves.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Dear Wyman House", "insights": [{"observation": "Officially plaqued and recognized as an important tourist destination in Moline.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "JC Penney", "insights": [{"observation": "Project includes necessary green space for a daycare.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Project expected to contribute to residential development.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Busch Construction", "insights": [{"observation": "Partner in the residential development project on Fifth Avenue.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Bi State Regional Commission", "insights": [{"observation": "The enviro working group had been trying to get more sustainable utensils and things like that in our joint purchasing.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Single use plastics is the biggest pollutant in our water system, and efforts are being made to move communities to use fewer of those single use plastics.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Prairie Rivers Network", "insights": [{"observation": "Finished a community climate assessment that they wanted to share for the whole Quad City area.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Interested in partnering on climate-related projects.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Police Department", "insights": [{"observation": "Involved in engaging with youth and creating youth programs as a way to tackle violent issues in the city.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City of Moline", "insights": [{"observation": "Holding neighborhood meetings where different neighborhood groups discuss strategies and plans, including cleanups and block parties.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Public Works", "insights": [{"observation": "Organizing neighborhood cleanups and providing necessary supplies like bags and gloves.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Dear Wyman House", "insights": [{"observation": "Officially plaqued and recognized as an important tourist destination in Moline.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "JC Penney", "insights": [{"observation": "Project includes necessary green space for a daycare.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Project expected to contribute to residential development.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Busch Construction", "insights": [{"observation": "Partner in the residential development project on Fifth Avenue.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 3198862, "chunk_end_time": 3605160, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmsGmyS3HQw", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmsGmyS3HQw&t=3198s"}, {"start": 49000, "end": 55000, "text": "e JC Penney project, would not be possible without that.

So anyhow, thank you very much for the moment to just share that. Thank you. Any other staff? No. Okay. Public comment. Diane Morrison, come to the mic, please. This is an answer to your question. Question about the 4 July parade. You have no idea about the history of it. It was started by a man named Ken Johnson, who taught at John Deere Middle School, served in world War two. His family was involved with the Moline Furniture company. Moline furniture company burned down, but it was located close to Sylvan island. The booth booths that you see in Lagomosinos were built by them. They also are responsible for what was the deaths at the Senate in Springfield, but I think they now have replaced those. But they were there for many, many years. So it's a company. They also did some furniture for the United States government in Washington, DC. And Kenny started it with 25th Avenue, with the kids that lived along there, east of 12th street, and then it expanded and went around that area. Sorry, has anybody documented it? Diane, you better write it down for everybody. I'm here throughout it. Put it in the record. Can you give us his name one more time? His name is Ken Johnson. Okay. And he lived on 25th Avenue Court. And I know he was living there in 1971 because that's where I live. All right, thank you, Georgia. Thank you very much. That's cool. All right. Anything further? No. Seeing none. Executive session. Your honor, I make a motion that the convene an executive session for the purpose of discussion of property acquisition. Five ILCs 122 c. Five. Thank you. Is there a second? 2nd.

Has anyone signed up to give public comment? Mister Alison, thank you for coming. And you have three minutes to make your comment. It is our protocol that council does not respond at this time, but if appropriate, we can arrange follow up communication outside this meeting. You have three minutes, sir. Good evening, council. I am Virginia Garfield School senior residents and it is a historical building. As the city of Moline knows, it let a corporation come in and buy up the properties at the old Moline High School and Garfield Grade School. And that company has neglected those buildings. They're historical. And while they neglect the buildings, they neglect the tenants also. Because if you don't care about taking care of a building, what would you care about taking care of a senior? All you want is your money. We went two years with no janitor service. Our floors weren't clean for two years until just recently. This month of March was been the second anniversary. No janitor service due to there was no money in the budget. So the regional manager said to me personally, and we pay some pretty good rent prices in that building. It fluctuates in the different areas. You have square footage of your apartment, some apartments running up to $875, and that's in the old section in 1901, built. And they had some problems with their heating here recently during this storm because of poor building. They didn't put caps on the roof of the heaters that they put in the apartments in the old section of the school, and they got plugged up from the storm. And those people went with algee for almost two weeks, and then the elevator went out, three weeks, no elevator service until they got apart. They never offered the company, Gormans, never offered to do anything for anybody. These seniors on third and second floor couldn't get down the steps because of their disabilities, couldn't go to the grocery store, couldn't go to the laundry room in the building. Gormus didn't care. But the other building over here that the Moline let me build and house tenants there by the molding pool. The morning Star, they call that. Their elevator went up, but they had enough staff to help the tenants. They helped the tenants get the groceries up and down from outside. Upstairs. They had plenty of help. A different corporation. Whoever vetted this, Gorman's company did not do a very good job of vetting them because they own properties all across the United States. And if they would have vetted here, mulling would have vetted that company because they were going to allow them to purchase historical buildings. All right. But they weren't properly vetted because of the neglect that they do to the buildings. They neglected Moline High School and then sold it once they made their money. And what they wanted to do, they never took care of maintenance. It was in bad shape. Enterprise. Have you all went to enterprise lately? Brand new building, got buckets going down the hall, catching water from the ceilings. Thank you very much. Your three minutes is over. Thank you for your presentation. I just want to give you an idea how a corporation is treating the buildings and the people. We have other buildings in Moline that are older, that have housed people longer, have been built since, but those buildings aren't falling apart. Different corporations. Thank you. The next speaker is Claudia. I cannot read the last name. No, they have three. You have three minutes. It's Claudia. Oh, okay, good, Claudia, when we speak Spanish, with permission, may I act as her interpreter? Yes. Thank you, Claudia. You have three minutes. Okay. Joveno Gikomo representante la comon Latina.

Okay, thank you, Miss Claudia. Thank you for your presentation. Thank you for coming here. Gregoria Gonzalez, cool. Next. Chief, could you repeat that? Gregoria Gonzalez? No. Crystal Castro. Crystal Castro? No. Okay. Denise Silas. Yes. I think picked it up. Okay. My name is Denise Stylus. I live in Garfield senior residence. You have three minutes. Huh? You have three minutes. Ten minutes. Okay. First of all, I don't understand who is going. And first of all, I don't know where to pay our rent at, because we've been. I've been there. We've been there, like, for a month with nobody. No mantras. They walked off on us. The maintenance people walked off on us. The total place is a mess. It's nasty. We had seven people who died. Two of them fell down the steps because the elevator was broke. The son took them down. They fell down the steps and died. I don't understand why these investors of Gorman do not clean their buildings up. They wouldn't want their mother to live there, so why should we have to be like that? I'm 70 years old. I got my cane here. I can hollywalk. I live on the first floor. I live where you walk in the door. The place is so filthy there. Nasty blood everywhere. And then we asked. I'm asking people what's going on. I don't know what's going on. I don't even know who I should pay my rent to next month. And I'm trying to find out, is there some way that y'all can help us to try to help me to try to find out who I pay my rent to next month? Is it Gorman or, I don't know, divestors? Because I haven't seen nobody in almost two months, and I'm there by myself. We there by ourselves. We have to take care of each other because there's nobody there to take care of us. So I don't know who I gonna give my rent to, and I don't want to give my rent to anybody. I'm sitting up there. I can't hardly walk on my leg, and I got arthritis if y'all don't know. I can't hardly walk on my leg, and I don't know what's going on because ain't nobody there to even tell us what's going on. The place is so filthy. We got mice is running down the door, down the hallway, and I'm still trying to find out where I'm supposed to pay my rent at and who I'm supposed to pay my rent to. Could y'all explain to me that? And every time I try to get in touch with the. With the authorities, up here is nobody there. I mean, people just not even coming out to even try to find. Let us know what's going on. I called in December because I didn't have no heat for three days. Didn't nobody even come out. I called the building inspectors. I called channel eight. Still nobody come out. So I'm sitting there freezing with no heat. Then all of a sudden the elevators break. We there for three weeks with no elevators. People can't even get downstairs. They had to stay upstairs for three weeks. The man took his mother downstairs because the elevator was broke. She fell down sheltered and died the next week. Thank you. Your three minutes over. Thank you for your presentation. Becky Graves. Hi. Good evening. Thank you. You have three minutes. Okay. Thank you. My name is Vicki Graves. I know some, but not all of you. I am chair of the Moline Plan commission and I'm here tonight because the council has asked plan commission to make recommendations on accessory dwelling units adus. I'm here to ask the council to not take any final action on Adus until there has been sufficient opportunity for the public to provide its input with five new council members. I just want to make sure that there's awareness that the subject of adus was the most contentious issue to come before plan commission in the past decade. There's. You'll be able to see the history of the discussion from the council minutes, but what I want to make sure everyone's clear about is that in 2022, the plan commission voted against adoption of Adus after a public hearing in which residents expressed significant moline specific concerns about the impact of Adus in the city. Members of the public also expressed concern about the lack of information provided in advance about the proposed zoning change and the short notice that was given about the public meetings that were held. Again, this is an important topic with citywide implications. Staff has done a terrific job summarizing information for the commission. We have a draft of an ordinance, but there's still work to be done on the draft and we'll be taking up that work tomorrow at the plan commission meeting. There's. We need to make sure that the draft ordinance aligns with the rental inspection program with short term housing consideration, short term rental restrictions, and make sure there's other alignment along with good development standards.

This is a good time for developers and for the business people who usually attend plan commission and participate in plan commission business. But 04:00 on a weekday is not a good time for people who are working or picking up children from school. I strongly urge that the council arrange for informal public discussions similar to the meetings held at Butterworth center and the library in 2022. I also ask that council ask for feedback through the city's Facebook site and the city's neighborhood groups. You're going to be talking about a housing study tonight, and this is a perfect time to engage with the public to get input on the topic of affordable housing solutions. I've been looking at this for over three years. I'd be happy to talk with anyone of the council about what I've learned so far, the history of the conversation so far in plan commission and city council, and I really urge that this be viewed with an open mind and with attention to citizen concerns. Thank you for your time tonight. I appreciate the council's commitment to affordable housing, to to quality of place, and to seeking citizen input. Thank you. Time is over. Thank you for your presentation. Yolanda Cervantes well, hello there. My name is Yolanda Cervantes and I am. You have three minutes, please. Hello. I am born and raised in Malin and Malin means a lot. Me, I'm second generation here, probably one of the first Hispanics from the Floricenta neighborhood, and I am here representing Mercado on fifth. I request that with the growth that we have and the economic part of it that has happened here in our community, that the requests to have our 12th street closure be accepted. We are growing and it means a lot to our community and we hope that you take that in consideration. Thank you for your presentation. Thank you. Maria Osberos good evening, council. Good morning. Three minutes. Thank you. My name is Maria Antevaros and I appreciate the opportunity to speak tonight. I prepared some short notes so that pregnancy brain doesn't interfere. As many of you know, my grandfather, Bob Antevaros had the original vision of Mercado on Fifth, a place for aspiring entrepreneurs in the Flores Sante neighborhood and throughout the greater Quad cities hispanic community to launch their businesses. Since our pilot season in 2016, so many individuals have come forward, some of them here tonight with their small business dreams of sharing their talents with the community, folks that never knew who to turn to before. And as a result, we've helped to start and provide a platform for over 60 new businesses and have changed the trajectory of many lives. After getting a start at Mercado, for example, Carlos Caudillo of Tacos Avapor that parks up at Zeglins on the avenue. He was able to quit his day job and go full time in his food truck, Dona Mary's Las Salsas, which is right across the street. They were able to test out their menu before opening their restaurant. I also wanted to share one of our vendors. One of our vendors daughters is part of a Latina empowerment group at a middle school in East Moline, and it was assigned to write a poem about the pride of where they come from. And one of our board members was reading through these poems at an event and spotted the following lines. I am from Sylvis, Illinois. Tacos chicken mole from the puesto at Mercado, the Venta de Hoyas on Friday nights, which means from the stand at Mercado, the sale of jewelry on Friday nights. The event means so much to our vendors and their families and with space being tight, we knew we were going to have to make some tough decisions this year. Tears were shed in both of the meetings we had with vendors who were waitlisted. This event also means a lot to the patrons. It's a place where people feel connected to their cultural roots, a vibrant place that makes people feel proud of moline and the quad cities, and a place that sparks jealousy from people outside our community. I would like to thank all the city staff and council members that were involved in the 12th street closure decision and support last year. I can't tell you how much the vendors and patrons appreciated the extra space and safety measures. And I can't tell you how happy it would have made my grandfather for the city to step up as a true partner. As we saw last summer, the event has become bigger than us. We need a long term vision and strategy in partnership with the city to leverage the assets that we've built and to grow the event's cultural and economic impact in a safe manner. I am hopeful that this is the year that we can come to the table together to discuss the future of Mercado. Thank you, Francis Williams, thank you for your presentation.

Good evening, council, you have three minutes. Thank you. I'm Francis Williams. I'm the new executive director at Mercado on FIF. I'm just coming upon my 1st 60 days and within those days, I've been spending a lot of time just listening to understand. And what has become very clear to me is that Mercado means a lot to our city of Malin. I grew up here and we didn't have something like Mercado to celebrate my Latina, you know, heritage. So to have a founder like Bob, like Maria, who had a vision for this and to see where it's come, I'm very grateful for the city stepping in, and I do want to acknowledge that publicly. I know that it was a lot of people coming in last year, very last minute, to try and help us manage with the size of the growth of the events that we had. So I do want to thank everybody for that. It was a lot of. Lot of work and a lot of stress. Stress, I'm sure, on everybody. But with that growth, I just want to share a little bit, since you understand from our founder some of the history I wanted to share. I have a lot of ambitious plans for Mercado. I think with our minority business incubator, we have a lot of opportunity to expand in programming and in education, to live out that value of being in a minority business incubator. Mercado has proven itself to be a safe space for entrepreneurs, particularly those from our minority community, to test their business, not only acumen, but their model, and see if it will take so to have that obviously in our community is such an asset. I hope to continue the collaboration with the City of Moline because I know that our original founders were so intent on having this place in Flora Cente specifically, and in the city of Moline. So to continue to grow and to continue to show that cultural recognition we really do, I will just state publicly how important it is to have the safe aspect of growth in both the Fifth Avenue closure as well as the 12th street closure. Those are going to be able to accommodate us, hopefully for a few years before we get into some new areas, maybe of exploration in alignment with where the city is going for the future development, which I'm very excited about and appreciate, too, that you've given the public the opportunity to. To give comment to those development plans. But our mission continues to stay in alignment with the city, and we will continue to move forward with a collaboration. And please know that from the bottom of my heart, to live the values of our founder, both of our founders, I hope to find the best win win situation for everyone. Thank you. Thank you very much. Laura Matzo, you have three minutes. Hi. Well, I am an immigrant from Costa Rica, and I came here because I felt in my heart that America was the land of opportunity. And I know after 25 years of being here, that is, it is, and it still is the length of opportunity. I am the lead pastor of a white congregation. I'm the only Latino there, and what I learned there is that Americans love my culture. And I noticed by being a little vendor over there at El Mercado with my own little products that I make, I realized that, yeah, it is a place for Latinos to get together, for Latinos to come and sell and have fun and everything. But I noticed that we're not the only ones there. Every Friday night, there's a lot of other cultures that come and they enjoy what we have to offer. And most of my clients were different cultures, not only Latinos. So I just ask you to please give us an opportunity to grow. Let us all open that street that we need so more people can come and share not only their culture, their products, but to make friends, to make connections to grow our country. Because this is not just for our latino community, but it's for the whole city of Moline. And we're not alone on this. We're together. We're a pot of old melting cultures, and we just want to have an opportunity to share with them what we have to offer and to love on them. And it makes us feel amazing to see other people, other cultures enjoying what we have to offer and allow us to just give us a chance to grow. It's going to be amazing for everybody. Thank you. Thank you for your presentation. Josefina cannot read the last. Yeah. I am a first generation from the Florida Siente neighborhood. I am also on the board of the Flor Siente Neighborhood association. We're here to support for the closing of 12th Street. I have been with Mercado since the beginning when there was only like five, I mean, five or six, I can't remember, with Bob. And I just feel that we have grown so much. And I think that the young people especially have a place where they can be without safe, with being safe there and being with their friends and eating. And that's how I grew up, eating my mom's food and having people over and being in areas. Erickson and St. Mary's. I just think that we've grown so much that we can't be basically without the closing because I was there when it was very congested, because there were so many people coming.

Does anyone have any question about agenda? We start with item 6.1. A resolution authorizing the Director of public works to submit a rock salt contact joint participation agreement with the state of Illinois Central Management Services for 4000 tonnes of rock salt, obligating the city to purchase a minimum of 3200 tons and the ability to purchase up to 4800 tons for the 2024 to 2025 winter season. And authorizing the city clerk to attest to the certificate of authority by vote and certificate of authority by bylaws to be submitted with said agreement. Mister Vitas? Yes. I'll turn it over to the public Works director, Mister Schmidt. Thank you. Good evening, council. Annually, public works engages in a public bid with the state. So essentially, the state sends out an agreement every march requesting the needs for each community that might be part of that public bid. Our need again will be about 4000 tons of salt. We did that this previous year as well. So it's pretty typical for us to request 4000 ton. So basically we're requesting to enter into that agreement. We will need to purchase at least 80% of that 4000 ton and we can purchase a maximum of 120%. So salt wise, right now, both our domes are full, so 4000 tons, Tom, is a good estimate for us. Motion. Motion to approve second. Jinx, who made the motion? Motion to approve second. Okay, thank you. Any discussion hearing? None. All in favor? Any opposed? Motion passes 6.2. A resolution approving a policy and a notice of non discrimination, an equal opportunity discrimination compliant procedure, a reasonable accommodation process for program activities and services for individual with disabilities, and a limited english proficiency LEP plan for the city of Moline. Thank you, mayor. These are policies and procedures required to meet the criteria in order to receive federal funding for certain programs. So, grants or programs that of the city that are paid in whole or part by federal funds come with the requirement to have on the record that the city have these certain policies which prohibit discrimination based on funding federal funding for certain services. So while the city has employment and other policies that prohibit discrimination, what we lacked, although we follow not that we do not enforce the law, but we do not have policies that specifically address provision against discrimination for federally funded services. So going forward, in order to remain eligible and compliant for these funds, we need on the record and presented before you these policies. Motion to approve. Motion to. Do. I have motion 2nd. 2nd motion by Finch and second by elder Parson Marcias. Any discussion here is none. All in favor? Any opposed? The motion passes as in the 6.3, a resolution considering all rules and regulations of the Board of Fire and Police commissioner commissions. Commissioners of the City of Moline, Illinois 2024 promulgated, proposed, adopted or approved by search board on exhibit a, attest hereto and approving same as an exercise of city's home rules power. Chief thank you, mayor, for Tem. In front of you, you have the modification for the rules that advance out of the board of fire and police commissioners. We've been working on this project for about five months. It was reviewed multiple times and revised multiple times by the commissioners with the advice of the police department. The changes that are redlined in your packet reflect largely a change in the way that we can accept applications for police officers. So, as you know, we've really struggled to recruit applicants to the police department. That's a nationwide problem. We've tried various different strategies, marketing strategies. This is another opportunity for us to try to potentially remove barriers to the application process. By doing so, we will, instead of base testing once a year, two or three times a year, allow applicants applications to come in what we call a continuous testing model. So the human resources department will constantly accept applications, and as those applications come in, they will initiate the testing process.

So, as you know, we've really struggled to recruit applicants to the police department. That's a nationwide problem. We've tried various different strategies, marketing strategies. This is another opportunity for us to try to potentially remove barriers to the application process. By doing so, we will, instead of base testing once a year, two or three times a year, allow applicants applications to come in what we call a continuous testing model. So the human resources department will constantly accept applications, and as those applications come in, they will initiate the testing process. A written exam can be scheduled, a physical fitness test can be scheduled, and if they advance out of those processes, they can then go monthly to the police and fire commission. We're hopeful that this is more convenient for applicants to continue to allow us to get people in faster. Then we'll still have to coordinate with the academy schedules. That may not change that, but right now, for example, we've been testing and we only have one eligible candidate, and I have six vacancies. So I don't even have enough candidates. And that's not even that. They haven't even passed the background. I don't even have enough candidates to fill the vacancies that we have. And so we're hopeful that this, we can continue to get people in. This also changes a few of the rules on how that will be done, giving human resources the authorization to close applications three days prior to the exam and then reopen them again the following week or whatever, changing, giving us some flexibility in the police supervisors that sit on the panel and then allowing us to change the list from being good, the entire list from being good one year to the individual candidates expiry date lasting one year so they can go on kind of contemporaneously as we build the list. The other changes are very minor, revolving around the promotional examinations that just added a minimum score to the oral interview. So we've never had this problem before and nothing against the candidates that are testing, but really, if you show up, you're going to make the list. And so we want to make sure that we have give the commissioners the ability to kind of set a standard that they want for promotions rather than everyone that tests, in essence, making the list. They may still, but right now the commissioners don't have any way to determine the candidate may not be qualified. And we think that that is concerning. And part of that is because we don't have as many people to test as well for promotion. So the board of police and Fire Commission recommends approval. Motion to have a motion. Motion to approve. Second motion by elder person fringe, second by casto. Any discussion? Hearing, none. All in favor? Any opposed? Motion passes. 6.4. A regulation approving the special event application for the Quad Cities Distance classic event scheduled for Sunday, May 12, 2024, that is sponsored by the Kornbuild Running Club. Authorizing a grant to the Kornbuild Running Club for the amount of dollar five from the special event fund for event marketing effort, closing certain street, more particularly described here, into vehicular traffic and authorizing the use of public right of the way in conjunction with said event. Sure. Mayor pro Tem, members of council, before you this evening, you have this request from the Kornbell Running Club for the May 12 closure of, I believe it is 17th street from Bastreet landing to River Drive. So they can host their, partially host their event. And we're a staff recommending approval and funding of $500 from our specialty events fund to ensure the success of their event. Do I have more time? Motion to approve secondary. Any discussion? I just had a question. If we don't know the answer to this, if staff could investigate. So the organization says the event is a fundraiser for scholarship fund that was created to help kids that want a better future for themselves and their families. Did they reinvest that money in the community where they have that event, or does the scholarship fund go back to Des Moines? Is that something we could ask them? Not a deal breaker? I just interested. If they would, that would be great. I think that's for the next organization. This is the food truck. We did the corn belt, right? This was the corn belt. Corbett running club. Oh, yeah. Excuse me. So, yeah. So we're looking for number five? Yeah. Okay, then no discussion. I think we had a motion in a second. Now, as we just needed. Yeah. Hearing here in none. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? The motion process 6.5, a resolution approving the special event application for the worldwide Food Truck Tours event scheduled for Saturday, July 20, 2024, that is sponsored by one event at a time, closing certain parking lots, more particularly described here, into vehicular traffic, and authorizing the use of public right of the way in conjunction with said event. Sure. Mayor pro tem, members of council, as pointed out, this is a first time event for worldwide food truck tours. Who does this elsewhere throughout the midwest? I'm sure beyond they've made a request for Saturday, July 20, 2020, 2024, to hold this event. It's my understanding from discussing it with staff that there's upwards of 20 different food trucks involved in this event, including numerous local food truck owners who would be invited. I believe we have two members online in case there are questions, which we could probably bring them up. We are recommending approval of this event for a first time in the city of Moline in hopes that it is successful and that it can be re established in future years. So with that, if there's questions of anybody online, maybe they can just introduce themselves. Can't hear anybody. Can you hear us? Yeah. Can you hear me? Yes. Jeff Grant with one event.

Thank you for taking your time here with us. I can address the question that you asked previously with the scholarship fund. We can work with the city of the city there to establish however you want to use that scholarship fund. If you don't want to use it as a scholarship fund, and you want to use that funding to support another program, we just did one in Benson, Arizona, where they, rather than do the scholarship fund, they took the funding and put it towards a splash pad that they're trying to fund for their new park. So we're willing to work with you on whatever makes sense for your community and whatever you need help with. That's been basically what we set up the fund for. Thank you, Mister Smith. So the event, though, has a fund that is essentially dedicated to our area, which I think that was, and I think it wasn't quite a concern on the use of it as a scholarship fund so much as whether it was serving people in our area or just going into the one national fund. I think that was the question, or. That's my question, yeah, absolutely. It's going to be put towards something in your community. We want to support your community, so if there's something that the community wants or is needing and help with funding, and we can help support that in any way, then we're happy to do so. Thank you. So you do this in Des Moines? Correct. We actually do them across the US. So we have ten cities that we're working through this year, through Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois. So we're kind of venturing out. We used to do them solely in Iowa, and this past year, we kind of spread our wings and we're taking it throughout the US, trying to grow our business and help support communities like yours. A quick follow up. And is the. With these other cities that you work with, the, I guess, correlation of the raising funds, is that marketed out there, or is that just more of, like, in partnership with the community and the background, how does that work? Yeah, you know, if it's a something that you. Once we kind of establish where we're going, we will definitely promote that throughout the community to let them know that a portion of the proceeds of the event are going to support XYZ, whatever it may be. So, yeah, absolutely. We want to promote that, and if it helps us get more people through the door or helps us raise more money for that particular program, then, yeah, you know, we want to. We want to promote that the best we can. Okay. Thank you. Do I have motion? Motion to approve? Second. Any discussion? Hearing? None. All in favor? Any opposed? That motion passes 6.6. A resolution approving the special event application for the work to end Alzheimer's event schedule for Saturday, September 24, 2024, that is sponsored by the Alzheimer's association, authorizing grant to the association for the amount of 450 from the special event fund to support the Friends of Work marketing distribution plan, closing certain street, more particularly described here, into vehicular traffic, and authorizing the use of public right of the way in conjunction with the said event. Okay, Mayor Bros. Council, this event is a repeat of prior years, and we are recommending approval on the requested date for the requested temporary closure of the one westbound lane and river Drive between First street and 12th street, basically allowing the event to take place between 530 in the morning and noon. So we are recommending approval. Do I have motion? Second. Okay. Motion by princess and second by Mercius. Any discussion here in. None. Aye. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Motion passes. Next, we have item 600, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a billing agreement with professional billing Service of Illinois, Inc. For ambulance billing and collection services at a commission of 4%. Mister Vitas? Yes. And at this point, I'll turn it over to the fire department to explain the history behind this particular arrangement. So we've been working with the finance department, Courtney Nelson and myself, we put out RFP 30 days ago. We opened them up on February 1 and received three rfps. Going through them and going through the checklist, you can see that they did meet all the criteria. However, we felt that staying with professional billing, who we've been with since 1980, and the fact that they did, the last time we did an RFP, they did decrease their percentage of take from 6% to 4%. And they kept it at that same rate for this time. So for those reasons, the committee would recommend approval. Do I have motion? Motion to approve? Motion to approve. Second motion by elder Sun Prince, second by Marcia? No, it was Murphy. Murphy. Murphy. Murphy. I'm sorry. Okay. Motion by French and seconded by Murphy. Any, any discussion? Hearing? None. All in favor? I have question to Margaret. Since we are not selecting the vendor that has that lowest provided commission, what is the legal threshold for making that?

And it's always the totality of the factors. Do we know what that difference is in price on a yearly basis? So, yeah, I did some math. So I did find out from the last couple years, but I just did it on last year, 2023, what we collected, we collected just around a little bit over 2.7 million in billing. So with professional billing taking 4% of that versus the 3.53.5, it's gonna be a difference of about $4,000, is what the difference would be. So professional buildings 10 miles away, very close.

I just want to make sure I understand what it is in the real. So, thank you. Any further discussion? Hearing? None. All in favor? Any opposed? That motion passes. We now move to our informational. The first is the 2024 to 2026 action Plan Dashboard Comprehensive report. Mister Vaitas, this is inviting. I promise I won't speak for 30 minutes on the subject, though I probably could because there's more than 30, 30 pages in front of you. First of all, I want to thank staff for working with the executive department to put this document together again for you for the current fiscal year as we enter the conclusion of March. We would have liked to get this out earlier, but with illnesses and things and absences, it took a little longer, but it is here before you tonight. It is in alignment with the strategic plan which was adopted last fall by the council and as was incorporated into the fiscal year 24, 25 and 26 budget. The strategic goals that have been laid out have also been identified in the action plan and the various duties, responsibilities, tasks, functions, costs associated with that and estimated completion dates. I think important to point out is that this. This plan has 47 goals that were identified and there are 47 action plans that will track those goals. This report is meant to inform not only the council, it's also meant to inform the general public about significant efforts that are underway to address the strategic plan, which was based on community input. Several of the highlights that I will point out is that at the mayor's involvement, the promotion of food security, as you know, we've taken some pretty active roles in that, and we have done some significant funding here locally, unlike our neighboring communities, and have really pumped resources into the moline community. But they needed a quad cities in essence. So that has taken a place in the forefront. Social infrastructure is another issue that was brought forward by the mayor and defining that. So you will find that she and I worked pretty closely with the staff to put together that particular goal and that action plan. And then of course, my favorite topic, comprehensive housing program. We are off and running, as you know, with our rental housing. We already have residents, you know, reporting houses that are rentals that need to be taken better care of. So it's having the effect that we expected. We've got a great team out in the field, and that's just one part of the comprehensive housing program. But the rental housing element is up and running. And of course at the last roundtable we did discuss the new fire station. And as you know, that process is underway as well. Investigating property, as well as bringing that back forward to the council. Unless there's specific questions about any of these elements, I'm always available, as you know, to answer those for you. But if you have questions this evening, I'm here for that as well. Now, municipal id as part of social infrastructure? No, the big one. The pool. I see. Complete, complete, complete. The bathhouse. 65%. Is it in line to open in? Maybe? Yeah. I will speak. I will speak for Mister Griffith, who is not here this evening. He had no agenda items, so he decided to stay home. Yes, it is scheduled to open in May. We are still recruiting lifeguards, so if you know of anybody who's, you know, a certified lifeguard or someone that we can certify, please have them reach out to the park and rec department for that purpose. But we are scheduled to open in May, usually memorial day weekend. So we'll throw that out there and then we're going to invite the whole community. There's not a lot of pools open. Bettendorf will be closed. So we are expecting a very busy season. Their project was delayed because of same reason our was delayed. The state doesn't have people to review plans and then do the actual inspections. So they're now suffering from the same consequences we did. Otherwise we had been open last year. We were delayed a year. Thank you, Miss Gusto. I just have a question on the landlord certification program. How close are we to getting, you know, I'm not gonna say full compliance because we're never gonna get full, but I mean, how close are we? Which item number? So I can. It is goal 2.1 b.

How close are we to getting, you know, I'm not gonna say full compliance because we're never gonna get full, but I mean, how close are we? Which item number? So I can. It is goal 2.1 b. So that was originally part of the crime free housing plan that we created, the ordinance. We were going to do a lot of that. We pretty much put that on that whole program. Crime free housing and the certification on hold while the rental housing program came to fruition. In the middle of this, we started crying for housing in 2019. And then now this rental housing came in. The city kind of pivoted towards inspections. So the landlord certification is probably headed towards something different. And then rental housing, I think, is what you're speaking to. And there won't be a certification to it, but the inspections. Yeah. There'll be the licensing of the property of the landlords, of the properties that are rentals here in the city, which is a growing issue. Quad City White. In fact, it's a growing problem all over the country. It's not just locally. And as an outgrowth of that, we will have a better list and control over who owns who doesn't and those who have registered versus those who fail to register. And then, of course, then it starts to speak to the whole issue of crime free housing as well, which is also an issue that's being discussed in Springfield. For right now, we're putting a pause. Got it. Thanks. Okay, next is Illinois laws, enforcement training and standard board ILetSB recruitments and Retention grant award. Sip. God, this is you, right? M. Yes. Thank you. Well, I was before you earlier about recruitment, and now I'm here about retention. So first, I'd like to acknowledge my police business analyst, Summer O'Leary, who does an amazing job with grants. You know, we pursue grants very aggressively. I brought this to her attention through my work on the state Chiefs association that Iletsby had about $10 million available for recruitment and retention. We worked with the union who had come to us a couple of years ago during the ARPA discussions about possibly getting bonuses. And so summer and I wrote this grant to get bonuses. So before you is the information about how we're going to administer that. We get consensus from you of course accept the grant from lets be, which is an amount of $84,000. Our authorized strength is 84. So if we were to achieve full strength in the next year, we would be allowed to spend up to $1,000 per officer as a retention. It says bonus, but in action its a fringe benefit to all 84 officers if they have a debt or liability in one of these categories, childcare expenses, housing expenses such as rent or a mortgage, student loan debt or medical expenses. And then there's one component for reimbursement, which is a moving expense if they move to the city of Moline, which also is alignment with our contractual benefit of the housing incentive for living in Moline. So pretty excited about this. I think it's a really great benefit. No cost to the city, it's a one time amount. And there is some metrics and reporting that we have to report back to the state as we expend the funds. But we certainly think that the officers will appreciate the small but worthwhile benefit to them of $1,000. Mister Smith, this just occurred to me, so I'm trying to wrap my head around it, giving it to them as a fringe benefit and paying directly out to the sourcing. What does that have as far as tax implications to the officers then? That's a good question. And we don't know because finance is working with the auditor and the consultant on how to work through that process and what forms that they'll need to give them. So once we get an answer on how that will be handled through the finance department, we'll communicate that with the officers. At this time, we're probably not ready to start accepting those forms to pay the debtor or the liability, but we'll wait for the auditor's expert opinion on if we need to file anything with the IR's or if it's a direct payment to a debtor. And there is or is an implication, and I guess I'm concerned about going straight, passing it straight to in that direct payment, followed by then that there is a tax implication of them not being able to recoup out of that payment the tax liability. As far like if they're going to pay taxes on that $1,000. Well, first of all, those are also potentially taxed in two different manners. And I don't pretend to be a tax expert, but a bonus is significantly taxed at a different rate than a payroll tax. So I think we need to know more from the payroll experts on those because they actually may get a better benefit by being paid directly to the debtor or the liability that they owe. Absolutely. Just so that I'm reading right, and I think I'm reading it right where it says, you know, child care expenses paid directly to the licensed daycare provider. Just meaning that the officer is paying a licensed day care provider. Not that the reimbursement is going directly to the provider. No, it would. It would go directly to the provider. So. Okay, so the money. So the payments not even going to the officer, it's going directly. Correct. To. Okay.

But again, we need, we, we need to know what forms and process the IR's expects out of that type of event, which I don't have that answer for you yet, but again, we did forward that on to finance and they have engaged the consultant auditor that will walk us through that. All right, thank you. Okay. Thank you. You want to stay up there, chief, for the next item, too. Our last informational is Mercado on 5th 2024 event schedule. Good evening again. Chief Gold and I will have a presentation, informational only at this point. It will discuss aforementioned Mercado and fifth requests for street closures. So as a new director, it's really giving me a chance to see public work operations, what we currently are doing, and certainly special events set up and take down as part of that. And I've noticed through that, you know, there's been really good support historically from council and from city staff for Mercado unfit. But it is complex of what I'm starting to learn. So I did kind of want to take a step back, in fairness to council, to kind of go through some challenges, opportunities that we see from staff sites. So consideration wise. Staff has been meeting regularly, I would say, dating back to last November. To my understanding, those conversations have ramped up a little bit stronger in the last couple months to really kind of dig down and figure out, you know, what challenges would you have remaining for Mercado on fifth? Stakeholders that we've met with would be Mercado Boys and Girls Club, club and also Metrolink, because they do have some interests in that area as well. And again, we're trying to kind of balance the directives from council and city administrator on how to go forward because we do have infrastructure needs, we do have community needs, we do have partnerships that we'd like to maintain. So it's all kind of a balance for us to proceed with, with a recommendation. So the items to consider those will be different PowerPoints, but the first one being the area where that request is being made. So there will be 17 total events beginning end of May through September 2 rain out dates. Of those 17 events, nine will actually be requesting 12th street to be closed. Each of the 17, I should mention has Fifth Avenue closed. So just nine of those will be 12th street for this event season. In order to do that, we will be using city resources, city staff to close those areas. And again, this was kind of over a several month discussion with those stakeholders as well. Another important consideration would be traffic counts for that area. 12th street is a little bit heavier traffic area. So that's why it is important for us to have certain safety precautions just to make sure the motorists and pedestrians are safe. So I do fully support the chief's recommendations for any type of safety in those areas. I think also in terms of equity, you know, something to consider, maybe in the future if there's other groups who might come request, let's say, 5th, 15th street to be closed for, let's say, Friday, every Friday or every Saturday in the summer. You know, that's something to consider as well, just because it does have an impact on public work resources, police resources. So it might be down the road, how to really get equity and. And several groups who might want to have events in the city. Also worth mentioning is financial support from city council. Previous several years, there has been a good sum of funds given to Mercado. So again, just showing that support for the organization. Last year, to my understanding, public works was part of the planning, part of the setup as part of the takedown. And we at that point did not seek reimbursement or charge back to Mercado. However, we will be doing that this year with the special advice policy and also to consider. Police department has purchased portable barriers to help with that safety. That was a larger expense that will be used on 12th street for those closures. In addition, we haven't purchased it yet because we quite decided on the best route to go. But public works could either purchase additional barriers to close down Fifth Avenue or purchase like a swing gate system like that. And again, the chargeback for this year, PD had 26,000 for last year. This year we're anticipating 30,000. Public works would have a similar type of chargeback from last year. Just so, at one of our last couple of meetings with Mercado, they had expressed some concerns about 12th street and Fifth Avenue. That's not this photo, but 12th street and Fifth Avenue. And Maria had requested a stop sign be added at that intersection. That is an extremely complex problem that we've tried to work through. As you know, any requests for traffic control enhancements are routed through the traffic engineering committee, which is comprised of many different experts within the city on all of our staffs, including traffi", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Mercado on 5th", "insights": [{"observation": "The city resources and staff will be used to close areas for Mercado on 5th events.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There has been financial support from city council for Mercado on 5th.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Increased safety measures such as portable barriers purchased by the police department for event street closures.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Concerns raised about the safety of 12th street and Fifth Avenue intersection, and a request for a stop sign.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Public works did not seek reimbursement from Mercado in previous years but will do so this year.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Mercado on 5th", "insights": [{"observation": "The city resources and staff will be used to close areas for Mercado on 5th events.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There has been financial support from city council for Mercado on 5th.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Increased safety measures such as portable barriers purchased by the police department for event street closures.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Concerns raised about the safety of 12th street and Fifth Avenue intersection, and a request for a stop sign.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Public works did not seek reimbursement from Mercado in previous years but will do so this year.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 3604290, "chunk_end_time": 4043202, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDbDr9ZaUwA", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDbDr9ZaUwA&t=3604s"}, {"start": 49000, "end": 55000, "text": " expense that will be used on 12th street for those closures.

And Maria had requested a stop sign be added at that intersection. That is an extremely complex problem that we've tried to work through. As you know, any requests for traffic control enhancements are routed through the traffic engineering committee, which is comprised of many different experts within the city on all of our staffs, including traffic engineers that evaluate that on a database, as well as the manual use, uniform traffic control, and then traffic engineering best practices. So when they reviewed that request, they were kind of perplexed on how to proceed. The intersection primarily has right angle crashes, which really wasn't the request from Mercado, which was more they were concerned about speeding in that general vicinity. But the data is more for right angle crashes, meaning a turning crash there. So it has the potential to support some sort of traffic mitigation. The issue with putting a all way stop, four way stop at that intersection is that it is just blocked from the vibrant arena. And if you've attended an event and parked in the vibrant arena, the outbound traffic that leaves there is controlled by police and that is paid for by the vibrant arena. Adding a stop sign at 12th street and Fifth Avenue will increase the cost to the vibrant by probably around $15,000 annually, variable depending on their event schedule, but around $15,000 because we would have to require them to post a police officer not only at River Drive, but then at twelve and five to get traffic to then disobey the stop sign and continue on. We control those traffic light intersections. We don't currently have any traffic control. At twelve and five, we looked at other particular potential mitigations were not recommended by traffic engineers. A traffic signal at that location would cost $350,000. That doesn't seem to. The data does not seem to support a traffic signal, nor the cost. So the traffic engineering committee has settled on pedestrian flashers, as you see that is in this photo here. And to give you real world reference, they have installed these pedestrian flashers on river Drive. The pedestrian flashers are proven safety countermeasures through the Federal Highway Administration. RRFBs is what these are called, rectangular reflective beacons. Flash beacons can reduce crashes up to 47% for pedestrians, which we don't have any there. But that was their concern about people crossing that intersection. So that is the recommendation from the traffic engineering committee. And that expense to the taxpayer would be $15,000 a single time for that installation. Thank you. All right, so also, there is, there would be an impact for operations, for public works. I don't, I don't want to say this as a complaint. It's more like a reality. So everyone kind of understands. So we will be involved with setup and take down for those street closures. You know, during the summer, we focus on sidewalk and roadway improvements. For us to do that on that Friday for 12th street closure would impact that. So it's possible one of those programs would not occur that day. For our streets division. However, closing Fifth Avenue through the summer months would help us because that would essentially not have us down there setting up or taking down. So that would help us if Fifth Avenue was closed for part of the summer. We do recommend, again, the semi permanent closure on Fifth Avenue near Mercado from May 24 through August 17. That kind of stopping point would be when school comes back in session. And that's when the boys and girl club would prefer that their participants actually get dropped off in front of the building. So Metrolink would go back to their normal kind of schedule with dropping the students off. So this would also actually reduce charge back to Mercado if we were able to close, partially close Fifth Avenue. Also, when school goes back into session from August 17 to September 27, we would like to have a partial closure on Fifth Avenue. This, again, would reduce hours for us to set up and take down. And again, it would allow boys and girls to have their kids dropped off. So these next four slides will kind of, it gets in the weeds a bit, but it kind of gives a decent understanding of what we're looking at for the closures for each type of scenario. So the first scenario would be for the non special events, which would not close down Twelve street. So the first one is for May 24 through August 17. Again, we're recommending that permanent barrier on Fifth Avenue. This would still allow ems to have their routes for emergencies. And again, for the first couple weeks, Metrolink would drop off the students on 12th Avenue and then escort them across the street. Next scenario is same timeframe. This would involve these special events, and we would have temporary barriers on 12th street similar to last year. However, we will not be using public works vehicles to block. Actually, again, it will be more barriers that either PD has purchased or other types of setup. Third scenario, again goes back into the school year. We will need portion of Fifth Avenue to be open for those bus routes for the boys and girls club, but we would still like a permanent kind of partial area. And the last scenario, again would be during the school season, there would be more temporary barriers, ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Mercado", "insights": [{"observation": "Mercado expressed concerns about

And the last scenario, again would be during the school season, there would be more temporary barriers, obviously, because there would not be a permanent closure on Fifth Avenue. And again, it would allow for EMS routes as well. So the decision points the staff are looking to find is again, trying to find a good balance between the city's strategic plan, which involves roadway improvements, quality of life, and obviously economic impact, which Macadam Fifth does have for the city. Also, it does entail closing Fifth Avenue and 12th street with our staff and MPD staff, PD equipment, public works equipment, and possible purchase of additional equipment to close those roads. And also we're looking to hopefully finalize MoU between the city and Mercado. That way we have an understanding going into each season what to expect. So I think we're looking at a three year agreement. Part of that agreement would have a standard in there. If the vibrant were able to pick up another event quickly, we would need to have 12th street open for that. So that would essentially cancel an event on that Friday night. So again, we're looking for closures on Fifth Avenue and 12th street. It's at council's discretion to decide how many closures that will be, whether it's the nine that's requested. It could be fewer than that. It's obviously it's council's discretion. And then we're also looking for that MoU between the city and Mercado. Timeline would be the information was tonight, committee of the whole would be the next meeting. And then following meeting would be approval by city council. Any question? I have a question. I hate to sound selfish here, but it's close to the reason you want to close the Fifth Avenue closure. That's where you come if you're coming east from down 6th street, that's the first swing to the left. That little cutoff downtown, my route. But anyway, what is the advantage of keeping it closed all the time? So if it was closed all the time, it would limit our involvement. We'll set up and take down. So that would mean that more road improvements, more sidewalk improvements for us and also limit charge back to my pathway. Okay, I'm questioning. So the nine events that we are, they are wanting to close for, is that nine something that was requested by Mercado? Was that something that we offered or how did that number nine come about? That number was actually presented to us by them with their event calendar, which they had prepared in advance of our meeting with them. Okay. So I appreciate everyone coming, you know, coming out and talking today. Thank you so much. It was nice to hear from the community. So I'm wondering why. What are the reasons for not wanting to close that 12th street on days other than those bigger nine events? Is it purely a safety, safety reason? Is it something other than that, you know, the public works time or. Yeah, to my understanding, the 12th street request is because those are larger events. So to safely and secure that road, basically we would need to close because it just seems to me, with the folks that are talking, that they were requesting more than nine or they were requesting, like, to have it closed every. And maybe I'm just misunderstood. I misunderstood, or maybe I didn't understand. Now we can let Maria address it. But it was three, as we thought. It became nine, and that's where it sits today. At nine, we were brought into a meeting with the city without any prior notification of what was on the agenda. And we were presented with an MoU that said that no 12th street closures would be allowed for the season. So we immediately came back with a bargaining chip of nine events that we really do need. As you know, you've been down there, the space is very tight. That is a starting point. We would love to have 12th street closed every single time. So I think there's a little bit of a misunderstanding of what our desires are. That was definitely a starting point and just an acknowledgement that it is. It is a lot of work for the traffic department. We knew that going in last year. At the end of the season, there were only 14 people on that traffic committee. Now they're up to 23, so they are better staffed, there's less chance of burnout. So that's another factor to consider. But just to be clear, our wish would be to have it every single week. Thank you. So every single Friday night we have to have our own staff do this? Or is there a criteria or a level of protection that has to be there, that only us, we can do it? Is there vendors that can fulfill that need? Let me jump in. My greatest concern is liability for the city. You know, when this council authorizes the opening of a street or the closure of a street, you know, that's. That rests with the council by ordinance. You know, we are responsible for those sidewalks, those streets, those curbs, those gutters. Anything that happens there is our responsibility.

Now they're up to 23, so they are better staffed, there's less chance of burnout. So that's another factor to consider. But just to be clear, our wish would be to have it every single week. Thank you. So every single Friday night we have to have our own staff do this? Or is there a criteria or a level of protection that has to be there, that only us, we can do it? Is there vendors that can fulfill that need? Let me jump in. My greatest concern is liability for the city. You know, when this council authorizes the opening of a street or the closure of a street, you know, that's. That rests with the council by ordinance. You know, we are responsible for those sidewalks, those streets, those curbs, those gutters. Anything that happens there is our responsibility. So when we start closing streets and we do it sporadically, often and often, and there's no consistency that does impact how people drive. You know, if you look at. If, you know, most people, they're looking at their Gis on their dashboards and they're looking at that, if they don't. They're not from here, or even if they are from here nearby, you know, they're always depending on that. So we have to ensure that, you know, the traffic signals that are on fourth and up on 6th, you know, between those two signals, we know that that is a race course through there on twelve. We know that. We know that people want to get from that one light to the other light, and they are timed in such a way that you cannot, if you're going to speed limit, get from fourth up to six and do it without stopping at the light, because if you go over the speed limit, it's the only way you're going to make it through. So we know that that Fifth Avenue intersection is risky. That's the reason why they were looking for stop signs. That's the reason why traffic. The engineering committee looked at it. That's the reason why we're recommending these flashers, because it's not like that every day. It's like that on Fridays when people are coming and going, because most of the people who show up for this event will park literally from 11th street all the way into downtown. So drive around when the event is going on and you're going to see that there's a heavy attendance. Parking is like, the parking lots are full, the streets have cars parked on them, and this specific location has a lot of foot traffic back and forth because that's where the main gate is. They have three gates going in and out of there. They have one gate over on the Fifth Avenue, Fifth and 12th. And they have another gate that's over there in that red arrow is at. On the north side of Fifth Avenue. And then there was another gate over there where the permanent enclosure is located. So they're monitoring the people as they're coming and going, and depending on where you park, determines which gate you come through. But predominantly, the principal gate is the gate at Fifth and 12th, if I remember Maria's comment last year. Yes, but I would argue, because I completely agree, that that street people are flying, flying down there. That is even more of an argument to close 12th. On our event nights, it's going to be more unsafe to just have Fifth Avenue because people are parking on the other side of 12th street and walking across. So from a safety perspective, it is safer to close 12th Street. I appreciate the idea of the pedestrian crossing signs. I think that will help, but that shouldn't be the main argument to not the other argument. And I'll bring it up to council now. Thank you, Maria, because you're right. The other argument, and it's a major issue, is infrastructure. Our street department is there to do something very, very specific for this city, and that's the sidewalks, which we have, many of which need to be repaired and replaced in our road work. And we only have a short window during the year to perform those duties. So if you're dedicating, you know, 19 Fridays out of the year to that, let's do the math and figure out how much less public infrastructure is being done and when you have a trip and fall incident on 34th street, because our guys are not able to get all of the work done that needs to be done because we're playing catch up here in this city. It's an old city, we have a liability there too. So it's a balance. And that's, I think, exactly why you saw infrastructure versus quality of life versus economics in that one slide. So you're spot on. So there's a balance here. And I think we've gone above and beyond. I think we've had a great collaboration. There could be no argument about that. I think that the Mercado is outgrowing its sight. They'll tell you that they are. And as I told Maria, we're going to have to figure out a longer term solution because the short term every year is not the solution. We need a better solution to how to address this growth in this event. Because this event, opening night will generate 9000 people. The arena holds 12,000 people, folks. The arena 12,000. This is 9000. Think about that and what we do when there's a 9000 person event in the arena, what it takes in terms of law enforcement to manage that. We don't even have that kind of law enforcement present at Mercado when there's 9000. But as the summer drags on, the number comes down, people go on vacations, they leave. Not everybody's here gets hot. A lot of people don't want to go out. But by the time we get to the day of the dead parade, it's another story. That was a great success last year. Everybody was happy. We argued a lot about that event too, but we came up with a solution that worked and people were happier. It's not perfect, but it's better than anything that existed before recommending that staff recommendation the council be accepted, and then we'll just see where we go from there. Because I do want those sidewalks and streets done. I have to. I have an obligation to all the taxpayers in the city and so do you.

Because I do want those sidewalks and streets done. I have to. I have an obligation to all the taxpayers in the city and so do you. And I'll rest my case. Thank you. Mister Smith. In the presentation, talking about the chargebacks on the public works, is that something about which there is agreement? And that's in some ways a question to Mercado as well. So that will be part of the new special events policy. It's going to be charged back per labor rate and per vehicle. There's dollar 100 per vehicle charge and then labor rate, which I did my best with. That's what the maximum is according to the asking agreement. And that's in line with our general policy, right? Yes, it is really, because that to me, starts to go at one of those most needed points. And I wander down the same avenue that Alderman Macias was going at. Because I agree, we don't want to take our straight street crews off the streets. And I don't know if there's that opportunity to even having a temporary employees to limit the number we're needing. So just there's that Mercado crew that shows up and does that work. That makes it harder, I'm sure, in a lot of ways to keep that staffed as well. When you say added crude, additional employees, added expense. So it goes beyond the 400,000? Well, it's. We've already hit the $400,000 mark as of what we're recommending. So, you know, you have to sit there and sell that to the constituents. I mean, you know, our recommendation is to do what we're recommending. It gets us to the $400,000 threshold. And we want to stop, and then we want to review, and we want to see what we can do. I mean, that area is susceptible to change. There's a lot of property there that may not permanently remain the way it appears today. The boys and girls club is looking to expand and build a gym. It's going to take away more green space from the green space where they channel all of the young people. So we've got a challenge. Care to try and address? And I don't have all the answers. I don't think anybody in the room has all the answers to this. I wish we all did, or we wouldn't all be sitting in here belaboring it. But we need to have a solution going forward. We're recommending closure on nine nights at 12th street, which is six more than I originally had thought we were going to do. No issue there. Permanent locations so that we can shut down Fifth street. My goal was just to shut Fifth street down entirely for the summer. Just shut it down. But that presents problems for the boys and girls. Club, you know, and they made it clear they need access, so that's the tough part. Excuse me. Do we have any idea how much traffic goes down Fifth street every day? Do you have Fifth Avenue? Whatever. I mean, from that, I don't think IDoT has a. An average daily traffic count, but I know the traffic committee, I think, said the intersection serves 4300 total entering vehicles per day from both roads. So I don't know if that's specific. Okay, thank you. I just have. I have one more question. So on the evenings when we are planning on closing 12th street, those nine nights, so are the vendors and tents. I can't remember how it was last year. So will those vendors and tents be set up right in. Right on 12th street? So will there be tents right there? What is that extra space going to be used for during those evenings? I will mention we're sort of stage. That was my rough estimate. It's not the stage when it's just a fifth avenue night is moved over toward. Actually, I wish I could. When it's just Fifth Avenue, the stage will be right here. And this. That's where usually. Is that right? As if we're in that sense, historically, yes. Historically, yep. And this actually takes away a lot of vendor space right here because we need to accommodate for the dancers. So we have to take away four vendor spots in this area when we just have fit six. Oh, six. Sorry, six vendor spaces here. So we've had to tell some vendors that they can't participate on those Fifth Avenue nights when we do have 12th street, go back to the other slide. The stage will be this way. And then we've got a huge area for dancing. And we set up several food trucks on 12th street before that temporary barricade. So we were actually able to count it. Ten more vendors on 12th Street. I just want to clarify. I know we've got a lot of boxes and things up here. One of the challenges that we have is we don't have enough infrastructure pieces to secure 12th street and Fifth Avenue both today. So one of the things that the city administrator raised was eliminating the use of public works vehicles. We talked about this last year, the danger of, because of the logistical problems of getting vehicles, if one of those vehicles is struck, that it could be catastrophic to other public works activities, such as snow plowing. So we purchased, we ordered, they have not arrived yet. $188,000 in bollards, portable items to secure roadways. That's a large dollar amount, but that only allows us to close one street basically each end. Okay. So Denver and I worked on, okay, what can we do to close Fifth Avenue? And those would be, correct me i", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Mercado", "insights": [{"observation": "It's going to be charged back per labor rate and per vehicle.

That's a large dollar amount, but that only allows us to close one street basically each end. Okay. So Denver and I worked on, okay, what can we do to close Fifth Avenue? And those would be, correct me if I'm wrong, like anchored concrete barriers. Right. They're going to drill them into the ground. Right. Because we don't have enough. One of the other slides talked about what you're saying. Gates, which are crash rated gates, the same crash rating as the bollards M 30, which is a 30 miles an hour vehicle. 15,000 pounds. Striking them would stop. We could potentially buy additional portable gates like we, like. We've already invested in $56,000 a piece. And those pop up. You see them a lot in large cities. If you've been to Nashville or Chicago, they have those everywhere. They drop the gate in the middle, they can drive over them and then we can raise them back up and then they can be moved. There's still staff time to set those up, but they're not city dump trucks or city plows. So part of the issue here is the resources that the city has available at its disposal to accomplish the plan. Any further discussion from the council, Mister Ismi? The mention that we had the vollars for two ends, the two yellow. We had three yellow spots here. So is that. Do we kind of. We do have enough for three or is there something else? We have to come up with another solution. The reason that Denver has the stage there is we were trying to encourage Mercado potentially using like a semi stage or something like that as one of the barriers. I don't know that we've come to an agreement on that, but we only have two gates that are 14ft wide and we're. We have ten bollards. Those bollards weigh 800 pounds apiece. They should be spaced no greater than 5ft apart. So we haven't arrived yet, but we are anticipating that those will close one section of street on each end. And that doesn't include, you know, try to avoid alleys. As you can see, we moved it down to void alley, so not have to close those. So even with some of these proposals, we're still, still going to have to find additional solutions to accomplish 12345 locations on a 12th street closure. On a Fifth Avenue closure. It's a lot easier, right? That is a lot easier and particularly easier. And I'm speaking now for Denver. If they're just there, right, they're screwed down around Memorial Day weekend into the ground and they're not taken back up until roughly school starts and, you know, the other. And we talked a lot about balance as we're trying to accommodate. As you know, we've had complaints from the businesses about closing the street down there, so we're trying to accommodate them. Boys and girls club, Metrolink. It's been logistically challenging to try to find a compromise where everybody agrees. I don't know if we're going to get there, but we've done our best to try to come up with safe balance of safety and the resources that we have available and all the interests. Any further discussion from the council? So I guess going forward, if I might, we do need some direction from council this evening. We. Their season is about to be begin. I mean, we're not that far off. I'm sure they're marketing and advertising, knowing them that these events are coming. So we need to have that MoU in place. We need to have an understanding in place as to what we will do or are able to do and how often we're going to do it, you know, and the staff recommendation is for the nine requested nights, even though Maria would like to have 17, and if I could give her 17, I'd give her 25. I can't. I just, you know, there's a limit. So. So I just need to know if we're in agreement with staff's recommendation going forward. For starters, doesn't take. I don't need a vote, I just. The consensus. General consensus or thumbs up. There you go. I like that. I'm generally in agreement. I think that. No, I think that the challenges at the site are definitely contributing to part of the problem. Making it hard. I do think that and needing to be cognizant of all the other factors, including getting our roads done, makes it hard to go all the way in. But it is an event that does bring a lot of people a lot of opportunity and a lot of pride. I think there is some worthwhile investment and I think we need to balance that and I think we're getting close to that here. I actually have one other question on the mention of the force majeure clause for a. So the tax letter could just pick up a. Pardon me.

Those are the events that really generate the most attendance, by the way. That's when we have sellout shows other than Snoop Dogg, right?

Yeah, the arena, God bless them, bringing in fun things for the Quad Cities. But Dirt Bentley is the night before the quad c marathon. The marathon usually has Friday night to set up, and I had to cancel their ability to set the marathon up on Friday night because Dirk's Bentley will be a sellout. And we can't have. We can barely get people in and out with the traffic control that we do. You imagine having river Drive closed, 12th street closed, you know, these various arteries, you know, it's a challenging location, like, a lot of venues, sports venues, and different things. So, yeah, and, I mean, it's unfortunate that's all the way in September, you know, over the weekend. But that's not germane to what we're talking about with Mercado. But it does happen. Yes, it does happen. It could. There's a potential, and we have to recognize that. I have a question for Maria. Maria. Yeah. Okay. Your vendor space, that seems to be the issue. Right? Vendor space is one of the big issues. Yes. And patron space, but vendors for the businesses. Do you use your building at all for vendor space inside? We do. You do? Yeah, we will be utilizing that as well. Okay. What about the boys and girls club? Because it's facing. Is there any way that you could use that for those Friday nights inside for vendor space? We do. We don't use the inside of the building. I think there would be too much. I don't think they would go for that. There's a lot of, like, really expensive equipment. They've got a whole computer lab. There'd just be a lot of areas to lock down. But we do rent their grassy area for a children's activity, and a lot of times, nonprofits, or sometimes our sponsors will set up big areas in there. So we do utilize the basketball court as well. I've been to a lot of vendor craft shows where they use, you know, any indoor space they can, along with outdoor to increase. Yeah, we will be using the indoor Mercado space for that, as well as the grassy area. There will be some. Some vendors set up in our grass. Did you just answer my question? If you're gonna. Cause in the past, I've seen tents in the grass, but it was like the library or not necessarily like a food vendor or people who didn't need electricity. Right. Okay. So you'll be using more of that space, too? Yes. Food trucks are not able to go in the grass, so really, it limits the amount of food we can have when we just have Fifth Avenue. Okay. I just was wondering, can we go ahead and can we. I know that you're wanting to do, like, the three year mou. I mean, I'm just thinking it's coming up so quickly, and with the new leadership at Mercado, are we able to just do the. Approve the one year now and then have, like, some kind of working group to work forward towards a three year agreement, or is that off the table? I know that's what they want. I don't want to negotiate this every year. I've been here three years. I'm not saying that we're going to negotiate every six months, negotiate. I'm not saying every year, I'm just saying, can we, like, have a pause and do it this year because of the change in leadership and then do a three year or five year? I preferred five. I offered five. They suggested three. I said that three. They suggested nine. And somewhere we meet all the time. It's how it works. We're negotiating.

I have no issue postponing it with the understanding, clear, clear understanding that we need to have an MoU and I don't want to bring it back in the spring of 2025. Guys, we're not doing that. We need to get it done and maybe get it done before Christmas, which gives them more. More than enough time for our new executive director to, God bless her, get her feet under the ground over there and make things happen for Mercado. That's why she was brought on and come up with a solution by then. So that way, from a budgeting standpoint, I know what we're doing and we can plan ahead because through those conversations, we may find solutions. It may have budgetary impacts. I mean, we know there's budgetary impacts. We weren't planning on another 15,000 for flashing pedestrian crossing signs. But if it makes it safer for the moms and dads pushing the buggies to cross the street, because I do go to this event, I would like to see that. And be honest with you, it's a tough spot. No, I agree. I mean, we need the longer term solution. I was just wondering if we can posit for. I just. We don't even have a special event application turned in yet. Yeah, well, so here's the discussion. So, you know, Macy was in tomorrow. She could crank it out for you like that. I know that. So let's. Let's see what we can do tomorrow, the end of the week, and bring something back at the first meeting in April, which means you can approve it there that night and then they're free to go on. We can move forward. We can skip that second meeting in April because that's almost too late. That's less than. It's literally a month before they launch the opening event. We want that to be a screaming success because that's probably what feeds the financial fire for the rest of the season. We can do that, but I want direction that we're going to do these nine as was recommended by staff, and then we'll come back with a new plan for next year. Sounds good. To support that. We'll come back with a solution. That's what we're constantly trying to do here. And do go and don't run out of food. Almost happened the first night. Or don't show up late because you won't get any food. Everybody agrees. Thumbs up. Just a minute. Thumbs up, everyone. Great. There you go. Okay. That concludes our committee of poll agenda.

The first I'm on the agenda's roll call. But before we do roll call, I just want to make just kind of a housekeeping comment. We will be having a public hearing on our agenda. The first item after roll call is the public comment. If your public comment relates to the topic that is the subject of the public hearing on accessory dwelling units at SE, please sign in so that we can make sure that we get you called up to the lectern. And we will swear in anyone who's going to be making a comment during the public hearing. So there's a public comment. There's in the public hearing during which comments about accessory dwelling units will be heard. And then there's also an opportunity for public comment at the end of the meeting. So with that just kind of a housekeeping topic, first item on the agenda is a roll call of the commission. Numbers in the ring. Okay. Graves? Present. Harpal. Here. Carter. Logan. Here. Moyer. Here. Silas. Here. Trevor? Here. And Wermouth? Here. Okay. We do have a forum, and then we also have a plan. Commission member Billy Allison, who is attending remotely. Commissioner Allison, I understand that you are traveling for business. That is correct. I'm in Springfield for work. Okay. And so that meets the requirement for eligibility for participation electronically, remotely. Is there a motion to approve the electronic attendance of Commissioner Allison? I move to approve the electronic attendance. 2nd, 2nd. Okay. Commissioner Wermuth and Commissioner Trevor seconded. All in favor say aye. Any opposed? If not, the attendance of Commissioner Ellison electronically is approved. The next item on the agenda is the approval of the minutes of the March 27 Plan commission meeting. Is there a motion to approve the March 27 minutes? I'll move to approve. I'll. Second motion by Commissioner Silas, second by Commissioner Logan. Is there discussion about the minutes? Any corrections or additions to the minutes? If not, all in favor of approval of the minutes, say aye. If not, same sign. Okay, the minutes stand approved. The next item on the agenda is public comment. And again, this section of public comment is for anything unrelated to the subject of the public hearing, which is the accessory dwelling units. Is there any. I'm sorry, Commissioner Martin. I'm just curious. Procedurally do. When we have remote electronic attendance, do we have to do roll calls or can we do. I think we. I think we have to do roll call for anything that would call for a roll call vote. Is that. I'm not sure what you're asking. Okay. I was just. I thought we had to do roll call if we were doing. If we have remote attendance. But I'm looking at Mister Silverman and he's, he's saying we're okay by stay low. You're fine. Yes. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yes. And also on. Yeah, I should say also on the attending remotely is David Silverman, who's corporation counsel with the law firm Ansel Blank. We talked to Jennifer Bazari, who is staff. The co room is. You're just on kind of watching. Yeah, also in the room. So. So you're in both places. I didn't see anyone in the committee of the whole room, which is connected electronically. KJ Whitley from the community development staff. And then Ashley Allen is also on remotely. Yeah, she's on our community development staff as well. Okay, got it. Thank you. So is there any public comment unrelated to the topic of the public hearing which is related to accessory dwelling units? Okay, if not, then the next item on the agenda is the. Is the public hearing. So I hereby call to order a public hearing on matter 20240, two PC to consider text amendments to the city of Moline's zoning and land development code, relying the allowance of accessory dwelling units in the r two zoning district, creation of sandwich use, and further text amendments as may be required. So we'll open the public hearing with comments by staff. Thank you, madam chair. And we're swearing in later then you're going to swear in before the swearing before. Okay. Thank you, madam chair. So we've been discussing a possible accessory dwelling unit ordinance here for a few of our last planning commission meetings. I know this is something that was talked about in 2022, went to council in 2023, and the city council has, with their motion back in December, brought this matter back to the plan commission. So we prepared a presentation here today just to kind of, you know, we've been talking about the need for accessory dwelling units, Lee Stash as for a while, but I wanted to back up a little bit just because we have some new folks in the room and make sure we do kind of a macro level view of this ordinance while we're also looking at the micro level. So what is an accessory dwelling unit? It's a residential dwelling unit located on the same level of record as a one family detached dwelling, provides a completely independent dwelling unit for one or ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Moline", "insights": [{"observation": "Public hearing on accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in Moline's r2 zoning district considering creating sandwich use and further text amendments as may be required.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Discussion around the need for accessory dwelling units to address local housing requirements.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Voting and discussions related to electronic attendance for meetings and the role of remote participation.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City of Moline", "insights": [{"observation": "Public hearing on accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in Moline's r2 zoning district considering creating sandwich use and further text amendments as may be required.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Discussion around the need for accessory dwelling units to address local housing requirements.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Voting and discussions related to electronic attendance for meetings and the role of remote participation.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 14200, "chunk_end_time": 377494, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKvgAJituIk", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKvgAJituIk&t=14s"}, {"start": 4000, "end": 10000, "text": "am chair.

So we've been discussing a possible accessory dwelling unit ordinance here for a few of our last planning commission meetings. I know this is something that was talked about in 2022, went to council in 2023, and the city council has, with their motion back in December, brought this matter back to the plan commission. So we prepared a presentation here today just to kind of, you know, we've been talking about the need for accessory dwelling units, Lee Stash as for a while, but I wanted to back up a little bit just because we have some new folks in the room and make sure we do kind of a macro level view of this ordinance while we're also looking at the micro level. So what is an accessory dwelling unit? It's a residential dwelling unit located on the same level of record as a one family detached dwelling, provides a completely independent dwelling unit for one or more persons with a separate entrance. And by that meaning a family can live in that. By the definition of family in our code. And an accessory dwelling unit shall be one of four approved types in our ordinance. Either an attached dwelling unit actually attached to the, the primary residence, a coach house which would be installed above a garage, a detached adU which would be completely separate from the primary residence, independent of that, and then an interior aDu, which would be entirely inside of that primary residence, maybe an attic, basement, or some other portion of the house converted to a residential dwelling unit. So this came from, I think it was 27 east.com. just a shows you some various ADU types and what they look like. This idea of the above garage unit we're calling the coach house unit, but otherwise, this kind of is very similar to the ADU types that we're offering. And the smaller image is kind of hard to make out, I guess, on the screen, but it kind of shows you how those integrate into the neighborhood. These are some real life examples. One from building a buildanadu.com comma, one from those kind of montage collections of the lower right are from the city of Albany, California, the one to the top right. I wish you could see a little bit better from where mine's sitting, but what I really liked about that one is it really reminded me of a molet house. And so it kind of shows how you could do this to really look like a molet house, even, which I thought was interesting. So, as I said, the city council had an action on December 12, 2023, they introduced a draft ordinance, not a proposed council bill, but just kind of an example ordinance, to reintroduce this discussion of Adus to the city council, but ultimately bring it back to the plan commission, which is what we've been doing since January. I would say, as we've been kind of considering this and various aspects of what an ordinance would include, what it would be, how we would regulate it. The only real guidance we got, well, we got, I guess, that a proposed ordinance that was attached there, not an actual proposed council bill, but just an example ordinance. And they also gave us a little bit of guidance there that they wanted to make sure these were subject to our new rental inspection ordinance that we have now, rental licensing ordinance that we have for all rental units in the city, and that they would not be used for vacation rental units or what you would call short term rentals, airbnbs. So why do cities need adus? Why are we considering this? Why is staff supporting this idea? Number one, there's a lack of affordable housing in our community. And that's not just our community. That's all across the country, housing prices have skyrocketed over the last few years. I'm sure everybody's aware of that. And then Covid really exacerbated that to a new level. Adus would offer more housing type options for residents of Moline. The other thing I would say just in general, is where are people going to live when you think about your sons and daughters and where they're going to live going forward, like, do you think they're going to buy a house? And I would hope that my kids would be able to do that. But the idea here is to get more options for housing. As most of you are probably aware, new housing starts in mulling have been down over the last several decades. Moline really peaked out population wise about 1980, 119 80, early, early eighties. And we don't see as many new housing starts in the city of Moline. This would be a way to hopefully get some new units going in as well. They do offer, there's an aging in place component to Adus. Right. So we're offering the option for senior citizens to age in place or stay in close proximity to family. Those of you that have done, a few of you. But if you've ever worked for a city and you tried to do some of this zoning regulation of what we would call a mother in law quarters, what's really that difference between a mother in law quarters and an AdU? Right. We would say, well, there's family living there, but what's going to happen to that in 1020 years? Like, it's going to convert to something else. And so this is also addressing that issue. Adus provide rental income to the owner as an investment opportunity as well. They also promote more dense development, contrary to urban sprawl. So the city's had a goal for many years since I started working here, developing south of the river.

Right. We would say, well, there's family living there, but what's going to happen to that in 1020 years? Like, it's going to convert to something else. And so this is also addressing that issue. Adus provide rental income to the owner as an investment opportunity as well. They also promote more dense development, contrary to urban sprawl. So the city's had a goal for many years since I started working here, developing south of the river. I don't really want to give up on that goal, but I think the way that goal is changing is that we've got, we've got to also reinvest in the old parts of Moline and find a new way to develop. Right. And embrace new people that are coming to our community. Right. We've got to adapt to the changing times here. So I want to go through some of the elements of the ordinance as well here. Most of the plans have seen this, but we should, for the new folks in the crowd, talk about the actual changes we're proposing to make to the ordinance here. As I mentioned, some of these come from the Nordvin, from Oak Park, Illinois, as some of the base. But we've been tweaking and changing things in this ordinance as we've gone. So the ordinance does include a amendment to the definition of accessory structure and accessory use to explicitly call out accessory dwelling units and refer to the division. We want to make sure as a note to my staff that we make sure these division numbers line up with whatever the final division numbers end up being if something gets approved by the city council. So we really break down these different ADU types in the ordinance as well. This really is getting back to the definition of ADu that I told you about earlier, but those four different types. Attaching means expanding the existing principle. The existing principle. I don't know why it says detached dwelling there, but it's a principal dwelling. Coach house means an accessory dwelling over a garage. So above parking spaces that are on the ground level and the coach house is up above that. Detached means an Adu, a freestanding adu located on the property such that it doesn't share any walls with the single family dwelling and is not a coach house. And then interior means an accessory dwelling unit that's entirely inside of an existing primary structure. Here are some of the general locations that would apply to all adus in this section. Number one, this ordinance that we're talking about, we're only talking about in the r two district, which is the single family residential district, accessory dwelling needs must fall within one of the defined categories that I've already explained to you. The property owner must live in either the accessory dwelling unit or in the principal single family house. Only one of those is only one ADU is allowed per zoning lot. And you'll have to meet not only lot coverage if you want to, if you want to. If you want to construct an ADU and you come down to our office to apply for that, not only will you have to meet the building code, but you'll have to meet setbacks. You have to meet the lot coverage requirements, which are 35% in the two reals district. So what that means is you can cover any lot in the two reals district is going to be limited by 35% lot coverage, including your house, any accessory structures you have, like garages or sheds, and this ADU, if you're proposing to build one. So 35% lot coverage applies to any of these, including if you want to build a garage or you want to build an ADU. An ADU cannot be used as a short term rental or vacation rental unit, which is how we define that in our rental code. We continue to look through the rental code to see if there's any changes we need to make. If we're going to allow adus, my staff and my rental staff, too, have looked at it. We really still don't think we need a change here. I mean, a rental unit is really defined as anything that's rented for 30 or more days. A vacation rental unit is defined as anything that's 29 days or less. We're saying that an ADU cannot be used as a vacation rental unit, but it will be subject to the requirements of the rental housing program. An ADU has to have its own separate entrance. That's any ADU unit type. So if you're converting your basement, you're still going to have to have a separate entrance out of the basement for your ADU. It goes without saying, really, anywhere in your house that you would install that you're going to have to meet the building code, but you're also going to have to have this separate entrance. No additional parking requirements for an ADU. I know that's a strong feeling of this plan commission. I feel like we were also on our list this year to talk about other parking minimums that we want to. That we feel are getting in the way of development. So no additional parking would be required for an ADU. When converting an existing detached or attached garage to an ADU, the required parking for the principal structure must be replaced on site. That's three parking spaces for a single family home. Usually that's accommodated by the driveway, and the garage is where you're meeting that requirement. Accessory diliance shall not have a separate driveway or curb cut. And then the final general requirement here, they shall be incidental to the single family dwelling. Use of the law in terms of location, appearance, and shall not alter the character of the principal structure. The architectural style, exterior materials, and colors of the accessory dwelling, it shall be compatible with the principal structure. So that's the language that we have in there right now, in case anybody's, you know, wants to. That's kind of subject to all this. Right. If we're proposing any changes today or tweet, this is currently what you have in front of you, and then the specific ADU types have some of their own requirements.

If we're proposing any changes today or tweet, this is currently what you have in front of you, and then the specific ADU types have some of their own requirements. Some of this is a little bit of redundancy, I feel like. And the reason we did this was just in case somebody's taking our ordinance out. We felt like it couldn't hurt to kind of remind them in some cases that, hey, by the way, you know, maybe we've already said this in the section, but we're putting this back in front of you again, that there are some requirements here. So other than an interior dwelling unit, every single dwelling or. Excuse me, every ADU is going to be only allowed if that lot. If the. If the lot is a minimum 6500 sqft in area. You've seen the maps that kind of show where those lots are in moline and I know those are included. If we want to put that up here, get that up there later. But for a coach house, minimum of 6500 sqft must be located in a detached garage on the upper floor above. Parking spaces located on the ground level shall contain no more than one dwelling. Unit must be designed to be compatible as referenced by that section I just read. Coach has to not exceed the height of the principal dwelling. The chair and I were talking about this. I think that's already in the code personally. But it can't hurt to have it in this section to emphasize that it needs to be no taller than the house. And then we want to talk about this when my presentation is over. You gave some guidance last time in terms of side setbacks and rear setbacks and the side setbacks we talked about for detached adus. I have applied to the coach house garage as well. Just in case somebody builds a new garage with a coach house up above. I felt like we would want those same setbacks that you included on detached. Now you may want to tweak this or change it, but that's the way I proposed it to you right now, is that the side setback would be 5ft with a total of twelve when you factor in both those side setbacks. So if you're down to 5ft on one side, you gotta have at least seven on the other. That's similar to what we would have for a principal structure. And then the rear setback would be 10ft. If you remember, there was kind of some talk last time about well, what's on the other side of that rear lot line? Is it an alley? Is it a street? I think that the suggestion of plan commission was that, well, if it's right of way there, we're not as concerned. We want the 10ft. If there's a. If there's a neighbor there, we want it to some more spacing and some privacy from the neighbor's house. But hey, if there's a. But you know, if there's not a neighbor there that we really maybe didn't need a ten foot step back. I can tell you that as I try to sort that out and how to best have that language be. I really. The way I propose it right now is that it would just. It wouldn't really be looking at where the rear lot line is. I think we want to talk. Excuse me. It wouldn't be looking at what is on the other side of that rear lot line. I've just made it 5ft on the side, 10ft on the rear. And so we can talk about if anybody wants to make change to that. But it was getting very hard from the staff perspective to say, okay, well, if there's an alley there, it's going to be this, or if it's a public street now, it's going to be this. When maybe there's a. Maybe with it being a public street, I'm just going to tell you, there could be a front setback along that street based on how the lot's been or how the street's been subdivided for detached. We have many of the same requirements. Right. 6500 sqft in lot area. This could be a newly constructed building or you could convert an existing accessory building, but you're going to have to meet the building code. And I can tell you that it's going to be kind of difficult to take an existing garage that's built on a slab and convert it into a dwelling unit just based on you're not going to have a foundation, how are you going to protect those utilities from frost? So meeting the building code is going to be something with any ADU that's going to be a hurdle to get over. We do need these units to be safe and so they certainly are going to need to meet the building code. So an ADU detached Adus had to be 1000 liberal space or less. That's the limitation we put on. The size of the ADU was 1000 sqft. Now, some people might think that and think that's very large. The size of that unit is going to be probably more so limited by lot coverage. The size of the house that's there now, because it can't be bigger than the house, it can't be taller than the existing house. It's got to meet setbacks and it's got to inform to 35% lot coverage. So we're putting 1000 sqft. If this ADU was able to meet all those requirements, you had a large house and you had a lot of land to work with. In that case, that ADU is going to be compatible with the house, because we already have a large house there to begin with, they must be located the rear or side of a principal detached dwelling. So even if they have enough room in the front to meet the setback, we're not allowing, those in the front yard shall contain no more than one dwelling unit.

Like I said, that's a little redundancy there must be designed to be compatible with the primary dwelling unit. Cannot exceed the height and maximum lot coverage. Once again, I put those setbacks in as 5ft off the side with a total of twelve and ten foot off the rear period. But we can talk about that if you want to propose changes to it. The distance between the nearest point of any portion of the new ADU and the principal dwelling must be 6ft or greater. That's typical with any garage we would permit or any major accessory structure we would permit, and we would make sure we have 6ft between the foundations. Mister Thomas, I'm going to interrupt you. Sorry, just because we have somebody else who just joined and I don't want to have you standing back, so if you're intending to speak, if you would just sign in, please. And there is some seating back over in the corner there, so I just hate to leave somebody standing. And we also have an extra room across the hall in the committee of the whole. If anybody wants to just have some more space, you can. You can listen to the meeting from over there too, and we'll eventually call your name if you're signed in. Thanks for the attached AdU. Also have the 6500 square foot and lot area requirement. 1000 square foot of liberal space limitation must be in the rear or side of the single family dwelling and meet principal structure setbacks. Those, once again, are 5ft, with a total of twelve, a rear yard of 30ft and a front setback of 25ft. So those are the setbacks for a principal dwelling, a house. And so this is being attached to the house. It would have to meet that. The new addition should be designed to be compatible with the principal dwelling. And then finally, the last ADU type we have is interior. It's permitted on a lot. We're not going to have the 6500 square foot lot limitation as we have it proposed right now for an interior ADU. So there wouldn't be a lot. A minimum lot size requirement for that. And it must have a separate entrance, as we've talked about, too. I think the main. The difficulty in the interior dwelling unit, it's definitely possible, but you're going to have to meet the building code there. So that's going to. It's not really as simple as just saying, hey, this room is not going to be an ADU. You're going to have to convert. Convert that. Have your kitchen, your bath and then your bedrooms, and then you're going to have to have fire separation, have your utilities dealt with, have your h VAC separated, things like that. We'll also require restricted covenant, so when somebody comes in to apply for an ADU, they will sign a restricted covenant that will also be recorded at the county. The main purpose of this covenant being that they agree to use either the ADU or the house. So they own this property. They have to reside in either the ADU or the principal structure. And then when the ADU at the recruitment property owned, upon an inspection, find that ADU has been removed, we can always go and, you know, get this released so that the property could be sold later. But the idea of doing a restrictive covenant is so that this is recorded. Anybody who purchases this property is going to know that, number one, there's an ADU there and, oh, I have to reside in one of these two units to have the ADU there. We've also added some provisions on enforcement here. I did receive a question about the fine. Not less than $1,000 and not more than $1,500. This was, I believe this was in the ordinance that was attached to the council action. So staff really haven't, you know, we didn't provide those numbers. I think the intent here was to beef up, you know, to have more of a enforcement mechanism that we would typically have, maybe to start the fines higher. But enforcement, you know, enforcement's not an easy thing either. I'm not gonna lie to anybody. I mean, it takes a lot of, you know, it's one reason to have the restrictive covenant, I feel like, is because that's when you can find something signed by that proper and say, no. Look, you agreed to do this. Here's the site plan. Here's what you said you were going to do, and you're not doing it. We'll make enforcement easier. So one thing I want to go over that we haven't gone over yet is criteria for review of any text amendment. And that's any reason only your text amendment needs to meet our approval criteria. There's seven approval criteria. I'm going to focus on the fourth one, which is the comprehensive plan in the most detail. But whether the existing text or zoning designation was an error at the time of adoption, that's a no. The second criteria, whether there's been a change in character in the area or throughout the city due to installation of public facilities, other zone changes, new growth trends, deterioration, development transition, etcetera, I would say, yes, we've definitely seen a change in our housing market.

As I said before, we're certainly experiencing a housing crisis throughout the country. We've seen increased housing costs in the city of Olin specifically. I think we've seen a lack of available housing just in general. You know, if you want to buy a house and move into town, it's a little tough right now because people are staying in their houses and it's harder to move with interest rates the way they are, construction prices the way they are. And we also have a lack of housing choice as well. Whether the proposed rezoning is compatible with the surrounding area defining characteristics of the proposed district. Are there adverse impacts on the capacity or safety of the portion of street network influenced by the rezoning? Parking problems, environmental impacts that the new zone may generate, such as excessive storm water runoff, water, air or noise pollution, excessive nighttime lighting or other nuisances. So I, you know, staff feel this is compatible use with the district. And we've taken, working with the plan commissioner, we feel we've taken steps to minimize or mitigate possible nuisance that would be associated with this. So we were talking about ideas like how far away from the property line should it be? How is it going to be compatible with the neighborhood? Now we may hear from the residents concerned about parking and the street network. I think our opinion from staff has been that we don't anticipate problems with parking because we feel like problems with parking are really kind of, in my experience, a household, each household provides a different strain on the parking capacity, and it typically is done by, like, how many drivers you just have. If you have a lot of teenagers that are driving that used to, that's usually going to be the biggest parking situation in a neighborhood. It seems like to me the fourth criteria is to look at performance, width and furtherance of the implementation of goals and policies of the comp plan. So these are the eight goals of a comp plan. I highlighted the two that I feel like pertain to this, to what we're talking about today, and that's housing development and neighborhood stabilization, and it's creating quality places. And those are the two. I didn't expect all of you to have your comp plans with you today, but I did leave two printouts of these goals on your, at your space there. So they kind of detail when we're talking about housing development, neighborhood stabilization. What do we mean? And so these are some of those things that are called out in the comp plan. Now, this is an old comp plan. It was done. They were working on a 1999, 2000. We're due, as you know, for a new comp plan, which we're going to start working on this year. But these are some of the goals that were in that plan under housing development and neighborhood stabilization. It was to promote neighborhood well being and improve appearance, protect neighborhood identity while dealing with land use change through flexible zoning standards, enhanced code enforcement, which is something that we've done this year with the new rental housing program. More higher density residential downtown and neighborhoods adjacent to downtown. Invest in neighborhood infrastructure. Advertise home repair and maintenance programs for all ages and income groups, especially being sensitive to the needs of the elderly and low income homeowners and targeting transitional neighborhoods. Pursue development of new subdivisions and then develop quality infill standards that permit developments of different forms and densities to coexist in existing neighborhoods. And then actively pursue infield projects that meet the standards. Diversify the city's housing stock and maximize the use of existing infrastructure investments. That's a pretty key one for me there when I'm looking at this. I didn't include all of them. You can see every single thing that's under those goals on your handouts there. But this is also on our website, so anybody wants to read 200 or 300 pages of comprehensive plan, you can certainly go on and do that. The other goal was creating quality places. This pertained more, I think, to the commercial standards that we implemented after this comp plan. So we didn't have landscaping standards, we didn't have building material standards and design standards and things like this. So what's in our zoning code now really came out of some of these goals in the comp plan. We did have some standards. We did have some goals about developing, implementing zoning and subdivision regulations that permit a variety of residential development. So it's a zero lot line, single family attached clusters, etcetera. And then encouraging traditional neighborhood development, which integrates housing, shops, workplaces, schools, parks, and other activities within easy walking distance. So I kind of picked out the goals there that I felt pertain to what we're talking about today, but I did include the rest of it there, so you can see what else is there.

And then the final three criteria. Whether adequate public facilities and services are available. Yes, whether there's an adequate supply of land available in the subject area that really looking more towards a rezoning. So I thought that was kind of an end, didn't really apply to what we're talking about today, but maybe somebody could argue that it does. But that criteria is whether there's an adequate supply of land available in the subject area and the surrounding community to accommodate the zoning and community needs. Maybe one way you could take this is say, look, there's really not a lot of housing available right now, and that's why we need this. Whether there's a need of the community for the proposal and whether there will be benefits derived by the community or the area by the proposed rezoning. Yes, there's a demand for more housing and different housing types. So I'll conclude my presentation here to say we, the staff, recommend plan commission, recommend approval of the proposed ADU text amendments and forward them to the city council. If you choose to do that, we would ask that the plan commission include staff's memo and the response to these review criteria as the findings of fact that conclude my presentation. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Matthias. So just, again, just sort of procedurally here, so if anyone from the public wants to comment, we'll swear everyone in as a group, and then Mister Matthias has said he'll be happy to answer questions from those who have comments. And so I think what we can do, just kind of in order, is we can have the public make their comments, and then we can engage in some kind of let folks answer their, or ask their questions, and staff can answer. So if anyone, again, if anyone intends to testify, speak, you make a comment, I'd ask that you please stand and raise your right hand. Sworn in. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony that you're going to give will be the truth? If so, please, for my saying aye. Aye. Okay, please, you can be seated. Please make sure that you've signed in. And did everybody sign and that stood out? Yeah. And then I think somebody. I'm not sure how quick you grab the sheets, Samantha. They just make sure that everybody gets the chance. And, well, we won't be overly formalistic here. If somebody didn't sign in and you, as long as you're sworn in, we can add your. We can add your name to the list and we can start. So just again, kind of procedurally here, we don't have a formal time limit on comments, but I do want to kind of keep things moving because I think there's a lot to discuss, and so I will try and keep an eye on the time. And if you have a comment that is similar to something somebody else has said, if you can just please state that and just, you know, and you'll give your name when you approach the lectern. But I will try and ask that everybody just keep their comments relevant to the topic of accessory dwelling units, and we'll just try to not be overly repetitive, but certainly really want to hear from everybody. I do want to acknowledge that we've got three city council members here with us today. I think I saw three. Debbie Murphy, Alderman Macias and alderman Timian are here with us this afternoon. And Mister Mathisa. Thank you. So plan commission is making a recommendation today. Again, this was brought to plan commission by city council in December. You'll recall that in 2022 there was also a discussion about accessory dwelling units and that there was an ordinance that was brought forward. It did not pass at that point. City council has asked plan commission to take another look at accessory dwelling units. As Mister Matthias said, the draft that's in the packet was brought forward by council with the assistance of corporate counsel. And then plan commission has been giving feedback based on what was brought to plan commission earlier this year. So plan commission is the recommending body. City council is the final decision maker on the ordinance changes. So with that just by kind of way of level setting, I do have a couple of emails that were submitted and I can start by reading those. So there are four emails in support of Adus. One is from Scott Tunnecliffe, who I know personally and know to be a resident of the city of Bettendorf. Moline could be a real leader in addressing the crisis in a way that steers us away from unsustainable urban sprawl. I support Abus and wish my community would embrace the concept. Mister Tony Cliff lives in Bettendorf. Bettendorf has an ADU ordinance, but it requires that an accessory dwelling unit be within the principal dwelling and that there can be only one entrance that they do. They do not allow two exterior entrances. This is from Dennis Platt in Davenport, Iowa. I wanted to drop you a short note expressing my support for Moline's auxiliary typo dwelling unit proposal.

Again, for dial, which does have an accessory dwelling ordinance, this is from Haley Trammell, qccommuteyfoundations.org dot hi Savannah. I am a member of the Housing community and am writing to express my support for Moline's proposed accessory dwelling units ordinance. This is an excellent and low impact way to add more affordable housing in our community. Kaylee Trammell is a grant making specialist for Quad Cities committee foundation. And finally from Kelly Thompson, also from Quad Cities Community foundation. As someone who has worked to provide affordable housing in my professional and personal life for nearly 20 years, I support Moline's proposed accessory dwelling units ordinance. This is an excellent and low impact way to add more affordable housing in our community. I appreciate Moline's progressive approach to this matter. It will serve the city and its residents well. Thank you so much. So are those all the emails that were received in support? And then we have one email that was received with comments on the proposed ordinance from Daniel Misner. And do we know his eastern Misner? Do we know he's on his mowing resident? He's on a historic preservation. Historic preservation. If you can please relay this to a plan commission. I do have a couple of concerns for the ordinance. After reading it over, I have an issue with the lot size minimum requirement of 6500 sqft. Since I didn't see anything in the ordinance covering the amount of the lot to remain open as yard space, I believe 600 7500 square foot lot should be the minimum. My justification would be the size of the existing structure. For instance, I own two properties with wildly different yard sizes, but with the same lot size of 50 by 130ft. One has 966 coverage with the house and detached garage, while the other covers 1344 sqft with the house and detached garage. I believe that this is just too small to add an ADU on and still have parking available since the garage would be lost in order to provide space for the ADU. I also believe that there needs to be a provision in this ordinance that limits the percent of lot coverage that building buildings can occupy. Thanks, Dan Misner, I'm sorry Meissner. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know. Thank you. Okay, are there any other emails? Okay, very good. And then we've got, we've got folks who are, I think most folks have indicated kind of for or against Adu. So why don't we start with the four adus? Because I think it looks like those who want to speak for are. I think there's a slightly higher number of those who want to speak for. So can we start with those who want to speak for Adus and start with just going down the list. Muller and Timian, please. Thank you, commissioner. My name is Matt Timian. I am the alderman in Moline's fourth ward. I would like to start by just thanking you all for taking the time to consider this. It's been a lot of good discussion, a lot of good debate. I know there have been feelings on all sides of this, and that's kind of the point of this body, is to. To have those art discussions. So I want to thank you in advance. Moline is a very unique and diverse place. And this isn't just the people. It also extends to the characteristics of our neighborhoods. We have a lot of different housing styles and that people have chosen to live in over the years. And just a few examples that I can call out. We have small homes near the river that were historically reserved for factory workers. We have a number of small settlements that were for arsenal workers. We have homes close to each other, not far from where I live, up a steep hill that were not at all designed for cars. They were very much a horse and buggy mentality. We have large mansions on the hill that indicate the prosperity and wealth of the earlier days of Moline. We have suburban lots on the south side with a lot of room to spare, very spread out. The point is that we're not a monoculture, not in our people and not in our housing options. And the housing in our city tells us a story. It tells the story of where Moline was over the years. Different eras and different decades, different kinds of people. And we welcome all of them, because Moline and its housing, it's a tapestry of who we are, and we accept. Everyone that lives here is part of this, inside each and every single one of these kinds of homes. Maybe. Actually, no. I'm going to include all of them. You're going to find Adus that already exist. You're going to find a garage that was converted in the fifties into a small home.

They're part of our unique fabric, and whether we like it or not, they're already here. When I proposed this initial draft ordinance, I did it to finally update our code to reflect what Moline is, not what people 25 years ago thought mulling should be, because that's what our zoning code currently says. This is what they want us to be. I want us to acknowledge who we are, and we need to legitimize the varied housing types that we have and open the door for our rental inspectors to get in there, make sure that everyone's safe, make sure that they're not being taken advantage of, and that we can have better standards going forward to make this thing kind of happen. I ask you today for your vote in the affirmative so that our city can recognize the existing character of our great city and continue onward. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Next, I'm going to apologize for any mispronunciations. Jeff Manis thank you. Okay, thank you. Please state your name and and you're down in favor of most certainly, and hello, distinguished members of the city of Moline's planning commission. For the record, my name is Jeff Manis, proudly from 20 315 13th street bowling. Today, I stand before you respectfully to provide my own personal perspectives and opinions on concepts that not only promise to address the pressing housing challenges we face in Moline, but to also a concept that offers a multitude of benefits to individuals, families and our community. To that point, in a community like Wolin, where housing affordability and availability are increasingly becoming a critical issue, ADUs are approving to be creative housing solutions for those that are financially challenged. These secondary units offer a unique solution to the housing crisis by providing additional living space on existing properties. First and foremost, Adus offer flexibility and adaptability. They provide homeowners with an opportunity to maximize their use of property, whether it's accommodating aging parents, providing housing for adult children, or generating rental generate generating rental income. This flexibility not only enhances the value of the property, but also fosters multi generational living arrangements, promoting stronger family ties and support networks. ADU promotes sustainability and urban development by utilizing infrastructure and land. They minimize the need for new construction, thereby reducing the environmental impact or impacts and preserving green spaces. Additionally, ADUs encourage denser, more walkable neighborhoods and promote community cohesion by reducing the reliance on automobiles, Aus contribute to the economic resilience for moline homeowners. They will offer a source of supplemental income through rental opportunities, helping to alleviate the financial burdens and improve economic stability for tenants. Adus provide affordable housing options in desirable neighborhoods, allowing them to live closer to work, schools and other amenities throughout moline. But most importantly, in my opinion, Adus Foster an inclusivity and diversity within communities by increasing these housing options and accommodations, a wider range of household sizes and income levels. They promote socioeconomic diversity and combat exclusionary zoning practices. This diversity enriches the fabrics of our neighborhoods, fosters a sense of belonging and inclusiveness to all residents. The benefits of vaux in the room dwelling units extend far beyond the mere additional living space. They represent a holistic solution to challenges of housing and affordability, environmental sustainability, economic sustainability, and social equity. By embracing adus, we can create a more resilient, vibrant and inclusive communities for generations to come. And it is for those reasons. As a 6th generation Molling resident is raising a 7th and potentially caring for a fifth generation, I humbly ask the members of Molling's planning commission to please consider approving the allowance of accessory dwelling units in r two zoning district. Thank you. Thank you. Now, I do wish I could sit around and hear all together compelling statements from the public, but I do have to run out. I have to head to Moline High School's auxiliary dwelling unit, that is the historic warden field house to help out the basketball community. So thank you again. Thank you. Okay, Christy, state your name, please. Stay covered. Il thank you. I don't have a long. Very nice. Like you've heard already, I'm going to share just a few notes on my own personal story of how I am interested in these adus.

And it is for those reasons. As a 6th generation Molling resident is raising a 7th and potentially caring for a fifth generation, I humbly ask the members of Molling's planning commission to please consider approving the allowance of accessory dwelling units in r two zoning district. Thank you. Thank you. Now, I do wish I could sit around and hear all together compelling statements from the public, but I do have to run out. I have to head to Moline High School's auxiliary dwelling unit, that is the historic warden field house to help out the basketball community. So thank you again. Thank you. Okay, Christy, state your name, please. Stay covered. Il thank you. I don't have a long. Very nice. Like you've heard already, I'm going to share just a few notes on my own personal story of how I am interested in these adus. Not too long ago, my son, who has a lot size that I think would fit what you were talking about. We were brainstorming that we could do something where I could live with him. Two things. I would be close to help with childcare, of which I am now doing from afar. And then in a number of years, I would be close so they could help me as I age in place. I don't think I need to go into all of the issues of how expensive childcare is and child health and then all of the issues with aging and the expense of needing assistance as you age out. Well, as we were really excited about doing that, we became aware that we can't even consider it in Moline. I said, well, that's not true, because I have been in many, many places, and Moline is a lifelong residence that have things that would fit this AdU statement. How can that be? We can't build one? Well, sure, we can build one, I suppose, if we want to go under the radar somehow, that's not the kind of people that we are. And here I am speaking, and I. That's it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Michael and Rose. And I'm sorry, Winter. Okay, please state your name. My name is Michael Minoter. Minoter. I've been a resident here. I wasn't born here, but I've been here for the past 30 years or so. And I'd like to speak in favor of Adus. I think that there have been some concerns as they decrease the value of houses around them. They certainly, I think in most places that they've built them, increased the value of the property the AdU is on. And generally I found in Moline that when a house besides it sells for 100,000, the house that was previously 50,000 beside it comes up to 60,000. So it raises the value of the houses around it. I'm mostly retired at this time. And, you know, we've got a larger house and we've been looking to maybe downsize. And we've been looking in Iowa because in 2022, the ordinance did not pass. Here we have a garage that maybe should pass, and it needs to be inspected, of course, that we could convert to an ADU. And, you know, as we get older, the balance isn't as good. And you don't want to fall down the stairs or even sometimes it's difficult to climb stairs. And if you fall, you break your hip. So it's better to be in a level structure like an ADu that we had planned. But since we couldn't have it, we've been looking at Iowa. We're holding off because of, you know, interest rates and so forth. And the cost of everything has gone up. So I think for Moline to introduce something like this would be very good for us and for numerous other people in the same building. On top of that, you know, they're not cheap to convert. From what I gather, Adus will cost anywhere from 70 to 200,000. If you really want luxury one, you can go even higher. So not everybody's going to go rush out and convert their garage into an ADU. So I think that, you know, with the restrictions that you place, like most places, have off street parking and you have enough, no Airbnbs, there won't be that many number of these structures being built. But for those that want it, I think it's good. I've lived up on 7th Avenue here in Moline for 30 years. I know my neighbors. I really don't want to leave. And an ADU would certainly allow us to stay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Tim Minor. Tim Minor. I'm speaking in favor of the eighties for a few reasons. This is near and dear to me. I'm a real estate agent here in Illinois and Iowa. I represent a lot of first time homebuyers who are finding themselves priced out of buying houses. I'm going to give you a few examples real quick. In the Wheelchee neighborhood, 19th and 15th, a house recently went on the market for 124,000. It had multiple offers. In 2021, the house sold for 100,000. And Crestwood Hills, which is where I live, 16 offers on a house that was come on the market at 215,000 and sold for 259,000. Near Franklin on 51st and 11th Avenue C. A house was offered at 134,000. We wrote an offer on the house for 15,000 over ask. And were turned to what? Who told that house sold for somewhere over 30,000? Over ask. We have a true crisis on our hands, and if you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem, because we have to figure this out for future generations. Why it's also personal to me is because my daughter recently moved back in with me. I have a house. Impressed with four bedrooms. She was in a situation where work didn't. Wasn't paying enough, she couldn't afford where she was living. And I don't know. I've got five children, and I don't know what's going to happen in the next 1015 years. I feel it's a duty as a real estate agent to address this problem and address it seriously. I don't think that abus are the only answer. It's just a small portion of this thing, and we have to come up with a solution to get it, you know? In 19, early 1980s, my grandmother owned a house. It was up near uptown. She lived at 18th Avenue and 15th street. This is my great grandmother, who was on the corner across from her church.

I don't understand how something that has been going on since the eighties, at least, that I know of, is not allowed today. And I know that there's a lot of people here. They're going to think housing prices, this and that. Listen, it's a big issue. It's a big issue. I talked to a lot of top producers in this real estate market, some big names that you would recognize and know I'm not going to name dropping. They were all surprised that we didn't have this ordinance already passed in Mullen because they've all been in these houses that have been single family houses that were converted to duplexes or duplexes that were converted back to single family houses. They exist. You see them every day when you're dead. And, you know, I know it's tough, but I think we need to do something, so I'm in favor of it. Thank you. Next, Dick Potter. And I'm sorry, there's this. Okay. All right, I'll skip you and come back to you. Judy Drake. I'm sorry. Also against. I'm sorry. Rochelle Carlin. No, you don't. Okay, got it. Okay. Sorry. I'm not reading my sheet. Right. Christine. No. Paula. Namp. Are you planning to speak? Yes, but against. Sorry. Alderman Macias. Good afternoon. Albert Macias. Second word, alderman. And excuse me for not dressing up. I was doing some undercover work for advocating for consumers, targeting predatory lenders, because they're here in Malene and just about everywhere. So I do want to speak in particular to this topic. A house is really a process, and this is something an old realtor friend told me years ago. And just like, our lives change, you know, from living in your parents basement, maybe the attic, getting your apartment, getting some roommates, right? All of us have had those life stages to finding your forever home and then eventually going to a retirement home. It's a process. And so myself, as I advocate for consumers, I look at this as another option for consumers for millennia. People should have a way of having their homes and properties adjust to their life. I believe in consumer rights. I believe in consumer choice. And when we start dictating to people what they can and can't do with their properties that they work so hard for, that's where I kind of get a little defensive. Right. People work hard to pay their mortgages. And this is something that I feel once we start trying to dictate on people's rights pertaining to being a consumer, we, as elected officials, have to step in and advocate for them. So I do remember when I was shopping for seven years ago, we were home shopping. We did run into a home that had a mother in law supporter. That's how it was listed. And we thought it'd be a cool idea. Unfortunately, it didn't have a great yard. And we have kids, but looking back at it now, we thought, we have a kid in college, and we think that, man, that could have been a great place for her, because as it is, she's almost like a roommate now. Again, live processes, right? And so they're out there. They're already out there, they're not regulated. I cringed when a friend of mine, a co worker, was showing me all these updates she did for her mother, who is now a widow, to move back in the basement, spend a lot of money, look great. And I realized that wouldn't conform to this. And just like the comment was made, choosing to do it under the radar, she really didn't know any different. But I didn't say anything. I just thought, well, don't show it to me again. So that said, you know, I'm all for this. Really opposition to this is counter to regulating the housing so that it's safe and it also adds another element of affordable housing and again, consumer choice. And the difference between now and in 2022 is that we now have the rental housing inspection program in place and that really needed to be put together first. So it's a great time to pass this and I think we just need to get on board with the rest of the communities that are really making things happen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

And I'm here to encourage your support for one tool that's in the toolbox to expand housing options in this community. Really critical issue Mulling is landlocked, as you know, on three sides by two cities and a river, and has very limited potential to grow. My assessment of the ordinance as written is that 6500 sqft lot limit and just the construction costs alone will really limit what you see in terms of people rushing to the building counter. I just don't think it's going to happen. In my line of work, I see construction costs estimating generally from $150 a square foot to 250 square foot. Even if you have that because, you know, a homeowner could sort of be a little more creative in how they fund a project, even at $100 a square foot. I mean, a 500 square foot dwelling unit is going to be $50,000. The difficulty of financing that I think is significant in any case. So I wouldn't, I guess I wouldn't rush to judgment that there's going to be a whole influx of these. But I do think it's such an important option for people that are aging in place, that need creative solutions for kids moving home and so many other things. My personal experience with Adus is a property that I bought in 1998. I was an entry level planner about two years out of graduate school, and I bought a two on one property, as it was called. It had about an 800 square foot, two bedroom house with what this ordinance calls a coach house in the back. And the income from that studio unit on top of the garage provided the extra income I needed to qualify to buy that house. I would not have qualified otherwise. That enabled me to then buy the house next door, which was a two on one, and the house next door to that. And because of that, the benefit of that homeownership early in my life, in my career, has given me financial stability that just simply would not have been possible and really paved the way for a lot of things for me. I now own multiple units, including the two properties in Moline that I mentioned. And my experience is, when a landlord lives on the property, bad tenants are less likely to want to live there. One of the other things that I see that I'm very troubled by in the quest for young people to be able to afford a home and stay in this community is that we have that syndrome of property management companies paying cash for single family homes. And I think mom and pop landlords who are just, you know, getting a unit here and a unit there really are the key to well managed properties. I think they're more likely to take care of them because they. It's their future. I can tell you that the property that I still own from 1998 will probably be my retirement home, and that income will very likely help me pay for my retirement. I urge your consideration to recommend approval of this ordinance to council. Creating new paths to housing and home ownership is an important public policy goal and a key to Moline's ability to attract and retain talent. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you. All right. Thank you. I'm sorry, there's one here that I am not able to read. Is it Susan? Susanna. Susanna? Yes. Did you want to speak in favor? Okay, please go ahead. Yes. Thank you. So, let me introduce myself. My name is Susanna Aguilar, and I am co chair of the floody Synthetic Association. I am also a mom and daughter before anything. So I speak to you in this moment to give my opinion. So, being a mom and a daughter before anything, I am in the mom still in life, where a couple years from now, my elderly mom may take a turn. One flip, one fall. It's that simple. What are the choices do I have as the key holder in my family if I choose to build on my property, build that coach house, as it says, or that mother in law quarters, whether I have a detached garage or not? Detached garage whether I have a he shed or she shed in the back, these are all choices and things that I work hard for to add comfort to my family. And just on the aspect of my mother. Again, she's within a couple years of where she may not be able to live independently. She is strong as ever. But she already told me she's not going to a home. She has and I will want to respect her wishes as much as I can. And if I have the assets and values to do that, I would like to do that. So that's one reason why I go in favor for this ruling. Another reason is within these of years, I'll have a college student. And whether she chooses that she wants to stay at home or move out of home again, I want to be able to provide the resources and the steps for her to have that transition. She can live in the backyard, that's fine. Have that accessory dwelling, have her own privacy, that milestone, that stepstone as she gets through college or maybe coming back from college. Either way, as Avido Mencias had mentioned that we have to grow with our time in life, either as adults or for our children or for our parents. Putting on my other hat of co chair of the Florissante.

I'm probably the last one that's in favor. So before the negatives come up, you're probably going to hear them say the parking, my parking, my housing is going to go down. It's going to be my, my, me, me. It's not what's best for the community. What's best for what? We need Adus, you know, in places where real estate is highly expensive, Arizona, California, these adus provide mechanisms. We've heard the senior citizens where we can build these units and we can take care of our elderly. And if you look at the statistics, they're very huge with Hispanics and asian population. Both of which are growing increasingly in the Quad Cities. And we're looking at, what, 6500 lots size. We didn't bring the map up, but I'm not sure how many properties that is. And we've heard in excess of $50 to $60,000. These aren't just, everybody's going to go out and do this. These are planned decisions alone against my house for $60,000. What do I want to do with this? You know, do I want to provide a safe place for my mother, for my daughter, for my son? That's all. Thank you. Thank you. Right. So I'm just looking at the. No. So, okay. So going back. So next up for the force, Diane Moore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. For, against. Sorry. Okay. Again, sorry. Diane Moore. And I would like to say that the lady who left, the elderly lady who left, I should be careful because I'm that elderly lady also. But anyway, she was, had to leave and she wanted to convey to you that she feels enforcement of this is extremely important if you're going to do it. She says from down next door to her is like seven people living in a one bedroom house. And she said in the other direction, down farther, there is, again, a lot of people in a very small home. And it's not, it's not supposed to be like that. So she wants to make sure that you have endorsements. Also, I would like to wonder, I know you read all the fours that came in, but these are people who don't live within the city. And that kind of bothers me as an individual because we are the citizens of Moline and we're here talking, and that is good. But I, I guess it just really bothers me when somebody out is trying to influence your thoughts. My first question is, why are we bringing it back? People spoke and it's like, okay, we're bringing it back again. If it was to be brought and dropped again, are you going to try the third time? You're going to keep going until eventually people wear out or we all pass away? One or the other. Number two, I do, I am concerned about parking and especially when it comes to snow removal and ambulances and the fire department, because I can tell you a few avenues in Moline where you have to start at one end and you have to wait for somebody to come to the other before you can go because it's that bad. Also, I'm very concerned about no special use and having the neighbors know. I think it's kind of blind siding the people. If all of a sudden, the construction people come and they're finding out that they're going to have additional neighbors. Also, I have a question about the size of a lot. You say 6500 sqft or larger. If half of that lot or a third of that lot is in a ravine, then that still is the lot size. And so that building could then be pushed in even closer in the existing framework. Correct? So that's correct that a ravine would count towards the minimum lot size? Yeah. And that, I think, is a problem that you need to look at. And I would also like to know how you people would feel if all of a sudden you had somebody building something next to you or you know, or when you want to go buy a piece of property. Do you want to buy when you know you're going to have extra neighbors next to you? Also, this property that you have, this Adu, can also be rented out for two to three months. So you could have people coming and going. It's not a case of just it has to have a lease. It could be people coming and going. I know that we are in a situation of where we need additional housing, and I don't see any creativity going as far as looking at expanding on the other side of the river. I think that that is something that the city has always talked about and talks about and talks about. And instead of doing it, all they end up doing is trying to drop more units into smaller spaces. And that's part of the reason why I'm opposed to it. Everybody is talking about this as an investment. Yes. Your property. Yes, it's an investment. You can, you can have income to help you pay for your property, but you're also going to increase the value of your property, and that also means your taxes are going to be going up. So that's what I had to say. Thank you very. Thank you. Next, Barbara Sandberg. Barbara Sandberg, and I'm a member of the historic Preservation commission.

So that's what I had to say. Thank you very. Thank you. Next, Barbara Sandberg. Barbara Sandberg, and I'm a member of the historic Preservation commission. Thank you for listening to us today. I wish to express my disapproval for the proposed accessory dwelling unit ordinance. I live in a house in the first ward on 26th Avenue that was built in 1928, the second house to be built in what was then a new neighborhood in a former farm property. As the neighborhood developed, all the houses were set back from the street in a similar distance, as were the garages to the rear of the property set back to allow city alleys. This pattern of neighborhood development would continue throughout the city until the 1950s, when houses were built with attached garages, eliminating the need for our alleys. But these homes too were laid out with similar setbacks from the street or the avenue. This pattern was done to achieve equal visibility and access to individual properties and was aesthetically pleasing to the general layout of the neighborhood. The city has a number of ordinances that protect property owners located in r two single family neighborhoods. The addition of fences is regulated as to placement and height, as is a site of placement of yard sheds. The mowing of grass and shoveling of snow is mandated. The disposal of trash and the regulations that restrict the running of businesses from a home or a garage has also been in place for many years and is kept a neighborhood where the families can live and comfortably and knowing that they're property is protected. Thusly, the city has a neighborhood improvement officer that responds to complaints on these and any other issues that might come up because these are single family r two neighborhoods and these are the background of our city, the introduction of the accessory dwellings to these established neighborhoods opens up the potential for a major change to the aesthetics and the livability of these neighborhoods. If this AdU ordinance is passed, my neighbor could decide to construct an additional building within feet of my property, infringing on my site line and privacy of my backyard and to the others that are in the block. The rental of these structures brings in additional people to an already compact location, along with additional cars that need parking spaces either on the property or on the speed or avenue. My question is, why would moline choose to disrupt established neighborhoods with structures that will occupy what was intended to be open space in our backyards? If an ADu is built next to my property or yours, what will that do to the value of my property in reverse? What would I look at if I were looking for a property and it sat next to an already built Adu and the style maybe was the same as the house to try to make it blend in? Would I even look at that property? I don't think so. Another question is why is this Adu ordinance being discussed again when it was soundly voted down less than two years ago? How many phone calls or emails had the mayor, the city administrator or alderman received asking that it be reintroduced? What prompted all this additional attention? How many petitions have been filed seeking support for the ordinance? I personally am not aware of any strong support for this issue. I've not heard a soul. Most of my friends have all said, well, why would we do this? This is not something they're feeling as an addition to their property value. How many of the public meetings have been held this time to get feedback from property owners after explaining how this ordinance will permanently alter the makeup of their neighborhood, their voices need to be heard. The arguments, we are told, is there is a housing shortage disrupting our established neighborhoods, some of them dating back to nearly 100 years. As is mine is not the answer to the problem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Frank. I'm sorry. Edge. Hi, Eggie. Thank you, Frank. Eggy. I unfortunately don't have a prepared, eloquent speech that some of our aldermen, city employees have come up with to push this. But in listening to it and looking at the ordinance, I think of my neighborhood up around Logan school. We have one person neighborhood. I don't want to see more rental properties come in because they're poorly maintained. We have one house that's about three doors down from me. A gentleman bought the house. It was affordable at the time. Put up a large garage in the back. Three cars takes up most of the lot could be made in one of these auxiliary homes. But he doesn't rent the home out. Last year it finally got repainted after several years of the neighbors complaining. Finally going to the city had broken windows in it. Right now a gutter has gone loose and is hanging off to the side. That would be one example of a rental property. He has two other ones in the neighborhood that he just uses a garage to store his collector cars in. So those are really not doing the city any good or any of the citizens as affordable housing. We have another neighbor next door to us who is a fantastic neighbor. He and his children are tourists, and I'm not m", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Moline", "insights": [{"observation": "I know that we are in a situation where we need additional housing, and I don't see any creativity going as far as looking at expanding on the other side of the river.

We have another neighbor next door to us who is a fantastic neighbor. He and his children are tourists, and I'm not meaning to complain about them at all because they are great. I like having them as neighbors, but they have a number of children. They have a large number of cars. They just recently picked up another pickup truck to go with what they've already got. It causes some contention, some hard feelings. People who the cars are parked in front of their properties. They can't use the sidewalks. Friends come to visit the neighbors. The friends have to walk quite some distance to be able to get to the home they're wanting to visit. The neighbors are great. They shuffle the cars around. If they don't, then somebody will get a toe sticker put on one of their cars. So that's an example of, if you have auxiliary home, what can happen? If you have more cars, you have no parking. So, you know, it would just be an example. They could take and convert the three car garage they put up. That takes up most of their yard. Now, they could convert that into an affordable home or into something their children could live in, move into. But that would mean if they're married, maybe have another automobile to have sitting out front of the, in the neighborhood. It could also mean that if the children lived there long enough, they would have children who have more vehicles taking up more space on the street. So, and then if I look at my house and I have some grandchildren who just purchased their own homes, affordable homes for them, young people just starting out, they bought houses, they're fixing them up, and they'll have some great places to live in before long. But I look at my home, if I were to have grandparents that I wanted to house in, auxiliary home like that, okay, they pass away at some point. I couldn't rent it. Or if I wanted to move, maybe right now, my house would be worth a couple hundred thousand dollars. That's an affordable home that would sell in a matter of days. But if I added in for a luxury home to the lot, take up a lot of the lot now, what would be the sale price of that home? Would it be 350,000? Is that an affordable home? So what's it going to do to actually having affordable homes? I have probably around my area or nearby, I probably have five, six neighbors who have lots that would be big enough to do that. But it would make the neighborhood look not very good, not very appealing anymore if they all did that. So some things to think about. So thank you. Thank you, Dick Potter. Thank you, Dick Potter. A little bit. 1136 25th street. First of all, as a former alderman, I want to thank you for your service. Often relied on recommendations from the planning commission, and I appreciate all your efforts. My concern is, I guess I'm sort of torn on this. I listened to some of the people on four, and they were talking about how things already exist, and we're going to deal with that because they're already here. And my biggest concern is enforcement. I was around when the last comp plan was passed. I was intimately involved in working with the planning commission on all those things. And one of the things that we worked on was when we created the two reals district, was to prevent single family homes from being converted to duplexes or triflexes. And we have considerable problems with rental property. I am beyond enthralled that the city council has passed the rental housing inspection ordinance. And I guess my concern becomes it would, I would, I would feel much more inclined to be supportive of this if I could feel as though the rental housing inspection program was up and running and well, and that we could, we could deal with that issue like I said, I'm not as concerned about parking. I'm not as concerned about some of the other issues that folks are talking about. My concern is some of the effect about enforcement. I know you talked about restrictive covenants. Who is going to follow up on that when the property gets sold? We have a long history of not dealing with rental problems or rental housing problems. Just some things to think about. I'm not necessarily opposed to this in a philosophical level, but I think there are some issues that we need to be concerned about. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you. Judy Drake. I'm wondering if that was the. Is that the woman who loved, do we think. Okay, so Judy Drake indicated a question about whether we should speak and indicated that she was against Paul and Nabbe. I think Paula nab stepped out. Okay. And I think that is everyone. Is there anyone who was wishing to speak who has not had an opportunity to do so? Ok, very good. So then I think we can kind of open it up for further discussion among the plan, commission and staff. So, alderman. Sorry. Sorry, Beth. Commissioner Moyer only have a side heart. Thank you. So I just wanted to just real quickly address this. Got brought back, and since I was on council at the time, and I did vote against it, and the reason that I would have passed, we could have passed it, and we wanted to pass it at that time.

I'm wondering if that was the. Is that the woman who loved, do we think. Okay, so Judy Drake indicated a question about whether we should speak and indicated that she was against Paul and Nabbe. I think Paula nab stepped out. Okay. And I think that is everyone. Is there anyone who was wishing to speak who has not had an opportunity to do so? Ok, very good. So then I think we can kind of open it up for further discussion among the plan, commission and staff. So, alderman. Sorry. Sorry, Beth. Commissioner Moyer only have a side heart. Thank you. So I just wanted to just real quickly address this. Got brought back, and since I was on council at the time, and I did vote against it, and the reason that I would have passed, we could have passed it, and we wanted to pass it at that time. I will tell you the reason it got brought back. It was a bad ordinance. It wasn't. We had, we had amended it a few times, and it just needed to come back and get redone. It wasn't a matter of it was soundly defeated or any of that. It was just, it wasn't written really well. And to that end, I just want to thank this body. But very specifically, we have new staff, we have competent staff at this time, who's really put the energy into getting this thing right. We've addressed, we've addressed the enforcement issues. We've addressed a lot of the issues that were problems in the ordinance. So this was more or less just getting it right. And that's the reason that it's come back this time. I'll piggyback off of Commissioner Moyer, not alderman. Yeah. So I was here for the last public hearing in December of 2022, and I was a no vote philosophically like Mister Potter. I think it's a great policy. However, as a newcomer to the city, I had just moved here about six months prior. I too had concerns about the rental industry here on both sides of the river. And so my loudest objection was that if we want to introduce more rental units to our city, we ought to be able to make sure we have quality places to live. You know, we see what happened across the river when, when inspections are ignored and such. And so that was my big concern. I too, thank the staff. I think you guys have done an incredible job over the last year, plus really fixing out some of the wrinkles in there. And so I've got some other comments, but I'll save them. No, you can carry on a couple of thoughts here. There was some idea that we could open up some neighborhoods south of the Rock river. And so I want to touch on that. And there's a really, a really incredible book out there. I encourage everyone to look for it. It's called strong towns. And what it touches on is the way that we've developed our communities largely since World War two has been a combination of things. But a big part of it has been using tax increment financing to build out neighborhoods, build out commercial spaces. And what happens is those deals run for about 30 years. At the end of 30 years as a developer, you have a choice. Do I put money back into an aging area, an aging place, or do I go seek out a new tax friendly deal from a community? And so what happens is you start spreading out that city over and over and over and over again and it stretches out the cost to maintain that city, the infrastructure. I was at a city council meeting last year that they talked about the cost to maintain our roads here is going to be about $7 million this year. That's taxpayer money. We have 275 miles of Centerline Road in the city here. And if we were to increase and continually to expand out and search for those new open spaces, that number is only going to grow higher and higher and higher. And that is not sustainable long term. And so I think there is opportunity south of the Rock river, but we've got to be conscious of what that means for more police, more sewer, more snow plow, more staff to maintain all of that stuff. And so it's not as simple of just opening up and going beyond that. Cities that have been successful in this, they've encouraged it. They haven't just opened it up. There's a community in the state of New York that has allowed for forgivable loans to build adus for their residents. I'm not saying that that's something that we should do here, but rather than just open it up and say, hey, it's there, take it if you want it, maybe lean into it, it encourages people that are outside of our community to come in and perhaps think of, hey, this could be a place where I can build a family. I can bring my family something of that nature. And so for that, I would say I'm in favor of this. Last but not least, we talked about loans. And how do you find a loan for these? Well, October 2023, the Federal Housing Administration approved or updated their policy to allow you to obtain a bank loan to build one of these. So if you're a prospective home buyer and you want to purchase a home and build an ADu, whether that's ground up construction, new unit with an ADU, you can use anywhere from 50% to 75% of that rental income as an approval mechanism for that loan. So again, we talk about affordability. This allows for new people into our community. And so again, for that reason, I'm in favor of this. Thank you. Hi. I just want to make a few comments. I believe you mentioned about being influenced by others from not in this community that emailed. And what I'm influenced by is our own people that live here. I live here. I have an interest in Moline. I came from Bettenburg, met my husband. I've been here 30 years. Moline's my home.

The only thing I can tell you is now when you do this, you have to register, so you're on the books. I mean, we've really tried. We tried with the inspection aspect of it and the rental inspection aspect of it. We tried to really touch on a lot of these concerns. None of this was done lightheartedly by any means. I thank you for your comments. You have great comments and made really good points. There are eyesores everywhere in this city. My husband and I have pride in our home, pride in our land. We have a neighbor next door that has a dilapidated, several things, trees growing up through their deck in the back. It's horrible. And I have gone over there and begged them to let me clean it up. So it's not just about building an Aud. I wish I had an aud that he built that had to match his house, that looked right, that had to follow the rules, because what I have now is a dilapidated playground equipment that is horrible and trees just growing straight up and down that encroach on my property. So it's never going to be perfect. We do the best that we can, but I just think there's been many, many good reasons, and this board really tried to make sure we had everything covered to the best of our ability so that these were built the way they should be and had to follow the rules, and that's all. So I just want to make one point, just as Mister Matthias said, so what's in front of us is a draft ordinance. Alderperson Timian made reference to the fact that this current draft was based in part on the work of what was done in 2022. I do want to make a couple of clarifying comments just to make sure that there's understanding of what is different from the 2022 ordinance, to the point about there having been a lot of back and forth. So one difference between the draft that was in front of city council in 2022 that was first voted down by plan commission and then ultimately voted down by city council, there was a requirement for a special use permit. I have said before, in fact, I spoke to city council about my concern about the fact that on the 2022 version of this ordinance, there were two public meetings, and certain representations were made to the participants there about what was in the ordinance. So one of the questions that was asked in that meeting was, will neighbors be notified of neighbors plan to build an AdU? And the answer at that time was yes. Neighbors within 250ft would be notified of a neighbor's plan to build an ADU. In this draft of the ordinance, there is no requirement for special use permit. Neighbors will not be notified of the neighbor's intention to build an accessory dwelling unit. Another distinction between the 2022 draft and the current draft, and again, what was described in the public meetings in 2022 is that there would be a requirement of a lease. It started out as a one year lease. It was changed at city council to a six month lease. That is no longer a provision in this draft, that the requirement is only that there be no short term rentals, meaning no rentals under 30 days, but rentals could be successive 30 day rentals. And I think someone made reference to it could be several, you know, several periods of rental, different renters over a period of time, and in the absence of any kind of lease requirement. That is correct that the rental ordinance simply allows or prohibits rentals under 30 days and allows rentals of 30 days or more successively. Another comment that was made related to the rental register. If an ADU is rented by a family member, the current rental ordinance does not require rental registration. If the ADU is rented by a family member, as that is defined in the rental ordinance, and it's by blood, it excludes, for example, cousins. And in a previous draft of the ordinance, there was proposed change, the definition of family that is no longer in here. Under the current definition of family, you can have up to three unrelated people living in any dwelling unit with a. With an ADU, you could have three unrelated people in the principal dwelling, three up to three unrelated people in the ADU, for a total of six unrelated people, the lot. And there was a proposal to change that to five per dwelling unit. That is not in this current. That is not in this current draft, to be clear, but that the definition, the change to the definition of family has been removed. The definition of family was in the original draft because the very original proposal was to allow Ad's for family members. And over time, as the ad draft, the ordinance draft evolved. The change was to allow for rental and not limit occupancy of ads to family members. So that definition of family is out. I think Mister Matthias included in the packet for today's meeting information about major and minor home occupations, and clarified, because this was part of the discussion at the last meeting, a wrencher and an aDu, or an occupant of an Ad", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Local Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "New homes with ADUs can use rental income for loan approval, improving affordability and allowing more people into the community.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There are issues with eyesores and dilapidated properties which affect community aesthetics and neighbor relations.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The current draft ordinance does not notify neighbors of plans to build an accessory dwelling unit (ADU).", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The current draft ordinance allows successive 30-day rentals and does not require longer lease terms.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The rental ordinance does not require registration if an ADU is rented by a family member.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Current draft allows up to three unrelated people in the main dwelling and three in the ADU, totaling six unrelated people on the lot.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Local Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "New homes with ADUs can use rental income for loan approval, improving affordability and allowing more people into the community.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "There are issues with eyesores and dilapidated properties which affect community aesthetics and neighbor relations.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The current draft ordinance does not notify neighbors of plans to build an accessory dwelling unit (ADU).", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The current draft ordinance allows successive 30-day rentals and does not require longer lease terms.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "The rental ordinance does not require registration if an ADU is rented by a family member.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Current draft allows up to three unrelated people in the main dwelling and three in the ADU, totaling six unrelated people on the lot.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 5377464, "chunk_end_time": 5821156, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKvgAJituIk", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKvgAJituIk&t=5377s"}, {"start": 84000, "end": 90000, "text": "e unrelated people living in any dwelling unit with a.

I think Mister Matthias included in the packet for today's meeting information about major and minor home occupations, and clarified, because this was part of the discussion at the last meeting, a wrencher and an aDu, or an occupant of an Adu can carry out a minor home occupation, as can the occupant of the principal dwelling. And a major home occupation, as defined in the ordinance, would require a special use permit. So you could have a minor occupation in the ADU, you could have a minor occupation in the principal dwelling. So simultaneously, concurrently, Mister Matthias talked about the coach house, and we did have a conversation ahead of the meeting with Sir Matthias and I. Currently, as the ordinance is drafted, there's no size limitation on the size of the dwelling space in a coach house, which is different from the limitation on the. The livable space and the other types of adus that are in the ordinance. And I think there's a question about whether that's intentional. I note that the draft ordinance was taken in large part. I think that the direction of council from an ordinance in Oak park. One of my observations is that Oak park has very small lots, and our proposed ordinance refers to kind of the total size of the lot in terms of defining the lot coverage size. And my question to the group is, would there be some benefit to limiting the dwelling space of the coach house similar to the thousand square foot limitation on other types of adus, because that seems to be an anomaly. And it would seem that you could construct potentially on a large enough lot, an extremely large coach house with a lot of livable space. And I don't know if that's really the intention. Clarify a couple things there. So I think number one, staff would be supportive. If you want to include the, you know, the 1000 square foot livable space limitation, we'd be supportive of that. Secondly, I know we were kind of talking about this back and forth, but I think in the way we enforce a major accessory structure or a garage would be, it has to be, the footprint can't be bigger than the house and the height can't be bigger than the house. And so that would still be that way for a coach house garage. But that we don't see any reason if you want to include that, that limitation on the livable space size for a coach house as well. So, and I'm looking at Alderman Timian since I think you were, you brought this to council in December. Do you want to, you want to make a comment? Thank you. There was no intention for that. I would be supportive of limiting the coach house to the size of the footprint building as well so that you don't have any, a home overreaching the garage. That's not the intention. So whether it's a square footage requirement or limiting to the being, I think the overarching limitation for all possible sizes, I see no issue whatsoever limiting that. Perhaps the amendment could say something along the lines of the lesser of 1000 sqft or the footprint, the building, not to exceed the footprint of the building. Yeah, I'm sure. Can I just jump in real quick? Yeah. Mister Silverman, he's a corporation counsel. Yeah. I would encourage the plan commission to have its own discussions and make its own recommendation. I realize some of the elected officials are in the room as much as anything. The elected officials while you, well, we all know they're aldermen. They're there really in their capacity as residents of the city. Okay. So it's really kind of not best practice to engage in that type of negotiation with city council that way. Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you, Mister Solberman. Yep. Well, I'll direct that to the plan commission then. Does that language satisfy? I'll second it. Well, I think we're, I'm not sure. Are we, are we necessarily needing to vote on and maybe I should be looking at Mister Silverman. Do we need to vote? Well, on the, on the overall ordinance, but do we need to vote to make changes? To points in front of. Point of procedure here in front of us. Yeah, go ahead. If I were to vote to recommend the ordinance as it's written, with the update to the coach house being the lesser of 1000 sqft or the structure of the building, could I make that motion and bring it to vote? Here's what I would recommend. I mean, you can do it that way. Maybe the better way, because you're still in the midst of your discussion, is to kind of get all of the thoughts in terms of changes and then work through them after you've compiled that list. But you can do it this way too. But it just, for the flow of the conversation, it might be better to just tag what changes you want to make and then take it from there. Thank you. Appreciate that. The public hearing, I think, is still open, right? The public hearing is still open. You have to close the public hearing, I believe. Do we feel like the people who are here from the public have had the opportunity to get their questions asked? I guess is my question. Well, ask does anybody still have questions that they'd like? Any, you know, staff is certainly available to answer any questions if you don't feel like it's been answered yet. Okay. All right. Yeah. Thank you.

There was a mention of this distance between the original building being only 6ft or an additional building. Did I get that correctly? In other words, my house, where it sits now, if I could build something, an additional accessory building just 6ft away from there. Yes. So that's the question from a member of the audience. Was it a six foot separation requirement for buildings now? So what's in our code right now? A principal structure, the house. Right. If you want to build a garage in your backyard, a detached garage, one of the requirements is that you'll have, you have to be at least 6ft away from that house, from foundation to foundation. So that's just the current policy. I mean, that's the current code that we've done the book since 2006. But you take an older neighborhood where we have our backyard, which is what we're trying to protect in some of these instances here that we value our space. To be clear, I'm talking about your property. So you are your house and you want to build a garage in your backyard. So you would come to the city and say, hey, look, I want to build this 3ft away from my house. And we'd say, no, you have to be at least 6ft away. When we added a number of years ago, back to back in the seventies, we added the family room at the back of our house, there was a porch there that we took off. The porch certainly was not as big as the family, but we had to be careful about how much additional space we were taking up. And how did it look with the rest of the neighbors? We were even told that we couldn't exceed our space further than any of the neighbors on the block. Yeah. So there's a number of things we would look at. This is something you do in the front yard. There's going to be a 25 foot setback, for example. But there are ways where we can. There's some ways we could tweak that and some automatic variants that kick in where we may look at what everybody else in this neighborhood is 19ft away. So therefore you can build a porch and be only 19ft away. There's setbacks. We would look at. We talked about lot coverage, so there's so many things that would influence right now where you can build a garage that are also going to be applicable to an ADU as well. But, yeah, that six foot separation has always been there since. I shouldn't say always, but it's been there in the zoning code since 2006 with people with alley. That wouldn't really. I wouldn't think that would have anything to do with it. That's, you know, I mean, we can put the map up, because I grew up, you know, we grew up neighbors, and I'm almost certain you wouldn't be able to build an ADU. We're not talking about 6500 square foot in that neighborhood. You don't have the lot size to build the ADU. So there is a map. I have not seen the map, but my particular lot happens to be a little bit wider than some of the others on the block. And we bring the map up. But I'm just concerned with somebody who's going to build something in our backyards and then ruin it. The aesthetic value of barnacle property. So just to be clear, I guess so everybody can hear. I mean, one of the questions is where you can build these in the backyard and the spacing. And so to answer all those questions, what's proposed in the ordinance right now for a detached Adu? If somebody in your neighborhood has 6500 square, square foot lot and they were able to do this, it would need, they would need to, number one, not exceed the lot coverage of 35%. So whatever that square footage is, they can't take up more than 35% with a house and all their buildings. Yeah, all the buildings on their lot. They have to be at least 5ft away from the side. From the side property line. They'll have to be at least 10ft away from the rear property line. And then it can't be bigger than the house and it can't be taller than the house. So as well as any other limitation that we talked about today. So I just want to make sure we're answering, you know, getting all the questions answered specifically and I want to jump in. If members of the public want to ask questions of the plan, commission or staff, please come to the lectern so we can pick up your recording. Thanks, David. So, yeah, if you want to. If you have a question for us, can we just. Did you swear in? I did square in. Okay. Okay. Can you say your. Say your name? I do live in Moline. We have two properties in Moline. I would say at this point that I am against this ordinance change. I haven't heard anything at this meeting and I appreciate your time. Nothing has changed my mind. I would just be curious and I wouldn't want to talk without having information for property tax values. Are these adus assessed separately or is this an addition to the primary house? I can only imagine property values are going to go up. You have an ADU. It's based on the amount of building you have a lot of times, and what the building is valued at. And you're also going to be making income on it if you own the property. So certain property values would go up and taxes would go up, which you'", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Housing Ordinance Update", "insights": [{"observation": "The ordinance proposes that detached ADUs must not exceed 35% lot coverage and must be at least 5ft away from the side property line and 10ft away from the rear property line.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Concern raised that ADUs might ruin the aesthetic value of existing properties.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Discussion about property tax values increasing due to the addition of ADUs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Requirements for detached garages include being at least 6ft away from the main house, which has been part of the zoning code since 2006.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Housing Ordinance Update", "insights": [{"observation": "The ordinance proposes that detached ADUs must not exceed 35% lot coverage and must be at least 5ft away from the side property line and 10ft away from the rear property line.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Concern raised that ADUs might ruin the aesthetic value of existing properties.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Discussion about property tax values increasing due to the addition of ADUs.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Requirements for detached garages include being at least 6ft away from the main house, which has been part of the zoning code since 2006.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 6125000, "chunk_end_time": 6510706, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKvgAJituIk", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKvgAJituIk&t=6125s"}, {"start": 94000, "end": 100000, "text": "ant to ask questions of the plan, commission or staff, please come to the lectern so we can pick up your recording.

And you're also going to be making income on it if you own the property. So certain property values would go up and taxes would go up, which you're seeing this as an enhancement to a property. I would think. I noticed the comment dense development. In my mind, dense development is not an enhancement, it's more of a negative. My other question was in terms of sanitation purposes. Most garages have electricity. Most that I know of don't have sewer and water. Who provides for that? Does the city have cost incurred in running extra sewer and water to these? So those costs would be on the prop. The person who wants to build this ADU is going to have to run a water line to the water main. Right. They're going to have to have sewer lateral that goes to there. And you're correct that a garage cannot be easily converted to that. Right. It's going to slam those. Those utilities are going to freeze if they're not protected. So there's going to be a lot of insulation and things that would go. Thank you very much. Thank you. So again, I'm just struggling a little bit with the public hearing aspect because I think this is the chance for the public to get questions answered. And I know to have planned commission debate, we need to close the public hearing. So I guess just one other. I mean, does anybody else in the public have any other questions that we haven't answered yet? Yeah, so I'm not hearing any. Okay. I think that we can close the public hearing and then proceed to discussion. And I think we got the question answered about kind of the sort of the hygiene on how to keep track of potential changes. So I guess my question, and this is getting the way of showing the map, but I think I heard agreement on restricting the livable space in a coach house to a thousand square feet. But then there was a question, do we need to vote on that, or is it sufficient to have that be a consensus? I think like David was saying, you kind of make. If you have consensus on these, you kind of make a list of them, and then I think you can vote on it all together. If there's only one, I'd say we can do it in one, but if there's multiple, I can go ahead and make a list of those right now. Right. Okay. Okay. I just like to bring up one thing about what you kind of reminded me before, the numbering system, and that's we're making a whole new division out of this, division ten, which kind of makes it hard to read, for one thing. I mean, SAR ordinance is divided into different divisions, like zoning is article three, but then the divisions inside of it, there's one. Division one is general, division two is basically residential or conservation. Three is commercial. Four is permitted uses. Then division five is telecommunications. Division six is stuff like density intensity, natural resources. Division seven is planning and developments. Division eight is cannabis businesses. And division nine is the molling center, former based code stuff, which is a very different code than the rest of the zoning code. So I would rather, if we had to do numbering system is to put it under 35, 30, 411, which is accessory residential uses, because it exactly what it's called almost in the title itself, instead of a whole new division. And then, Sean, you're thinking, is that all this language that would have been in division ten is just simply under the land use regulations for that particular land use? Is that what you're suggesting? Yeah, just with that numbering system. And then we could also put it in the table as such to be in the. So this is kind of a. It is an important discussion to have now with the way it's proposed to you. So. But in terms of how we organize the zoning code, and keep in mind, we're planning on having a new zoo zone, new zoning code, in a few years. But I think what Sean suggesting is probably a good idea to have this, this land use would get added. If you decide to do this land use gets added to the table and then all of these things that we're talking about in the new division would just be under the land use regulations for an ADU that would still capture anything you want to have in this ordinance, but would just be shown in the code a little slightly different way. But with this approval, we would be changing the section number, is what he's saying. We need to have that as part of our change. No, no, no. We'll deal with the codification afterwards. The substance is really what's important here. Okay. Yeah. Because ultimately it's council that is going to improve it. Yeah. That makes it easier for today. Yeah. Is there any other changes outside of the coach house? Thousand square feet. I guess I'll start and say I don't personally, I don't know if maybe go around and offer up. Well, I'm sorry that we lost the public, but I certainly have the concern about the setback because in some of the neighborhoods where the neighborhoods were designed with more open space, I don't know that, I don't personally think a setback is sufficient to account for that. And that was speaking, I think, to kind of the different nature of the, of the neighborhoods.

And that was speaking, I think, to kind of the different nature of the, of the neighborhoods. There are neighborhoods that were designed around open space. And even with a setback, a patio. If someone built an AV at the patio, that patio could go right up to the property line. Right. Because there's not a setback requirement for a patio. Right. I mean, yeah. It's not going to be the same setbacks for. As a building. You're correct. Yeah. So what I go back to is, and this is along the lines of what the person who's the former police officer brought up, that it's one thing when you've got an attachment to an existing dwelling. It's nothing when you're building a new property or a new structure in a yard where it's adjacent to other people's yards and affecting other people's. Do you have a proposed change that we could. Again, I'll go back, I'll throw out special use permits again for unattached adus. I'm going to be a no vote personally, and I help you understand what's the. Again. So the conversation was about it's $50,000 at least to build a new. Is there a change to the ordinance? I'm not sure what it would be. So adding a specialties permit for special use. Permit requirement for a detached ad would be. Yes, would be a change to the ordinance draft that's in front of us. So we can vote on it then. Yeah. Well, we can add. Well, I think what mister son was saying, I have to vote on it. I think it's a consensus question. Okay. So again, because what I'm trying to react to is what I think I hear from the public. Yeah. So I guess does anybody have changes to what staff proposed? Because I know we put those side setbacks in there based on some of your feedback we got. So does anybody have changes to those or as the chair suggested, I guess, to having that be a special use because the setbacks would be only for the detached house, which are the ones where you'd be building. Potentially. Potentially building in a space that's, you know, affects the privacy view, etcetera, of neighboring. Neighboring properties. So that's under section two one and two. Yeah. So I guess the question is if you want to change those setbacks or if you want there to be a special use requirement, I think. Is there anybody else that's in support of that? Okay. And or change to the setback? We think that this is an adequate setback. Recognize that there could be, like, patio or other accoutrements that would go right into the property. It would be some of the similar things, I guess, that you would see in somebody's backyard if there was just a house there. Right. Okay. The Oak park ordinance does call for property number. I'm sorry, house number. And we have not. This does not address the house number. Probably in a different code that requires that. But if you do, you want to. If you want to add that requirement, and then we can just make sure that it's somewhere else before it gets to city council. If you want to make plan conditional. Chris. Yes, sorry. So that's a lot of times that's something. When the building application comes in for the new dwelling unit, it goes through a process whereby, like police and fire, you know, assign, you know, an address based on the addresses either existing or how they're set up in a neighborhood. Sometimes staff does it, but that's like an internal thing. It's an administrative thing tied to the building permit. And that's what I think it is. But I guess. I'm guessing right now without seeing it in the ordinance, but, yeah, I think it's not a concern. Planning assigns the addresses. Now. I just meant work. Yeah, I mean, that's. Yeah, that's where I guess is what I was saying. So it's not. It's not overlooked. It's simply taking care of in a different part of the code. Because again, I think the conversation that it's important for fire. Yes. I know that sometimes the existing address might have to get. Might need to be changed in order to make the new address, such as if there wasn't an extra number, you might have to have the existing address be whatever address, suite one, and then new address be whatever address suite two if they had to be the same address. So I don't know if you want to notify the homeowner that their current address might change as well. Yeah. That causes conflict sometimes. Would still be worked out probably with the internal policy. Yeah, that's interesting. So I build an ad and I might have to change my address, possibly. Okay. With regard to enforcement, I think we should avoid that at all, at all costs. Yeah, I don't think we want to be. I think you could just have the same address, dash a or something, but you guys could work that out internally. I can't even get my mail delivered to 34th Avenue B court because of the B. So if you threw another wrinkle on there, it would make it really tough. We heard some comments on enforcement. Chris and I had a conversation about it. Right now, the ordinance draft says $1000 to $1,500 per day, and we don't have clarity. I think you don't know why you said that's higher than. That's a higher fine per day than some other ordinance violations, but you're n", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Setback requirements for new buildings or structures to account for neighborhood open space and privacy views of neighboring properties.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Special use permits for detached Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs).", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Concerns about enforcement and addressing of new buildings, which may impact existing addresses and administrative processes.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Ordinance draft includes a high daily fine for violations, which may be higher compared to other ordinance violations.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Municipality", "insights": [{"observation": "Setback requirements for new buildings or structures to account for neighborhood open space and privacy views of neighboring properties.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Special use permits for detached Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs).", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Concerns about enforcement and addressing of new buildings, which may impact existing addresses and administrative processes.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Ordinance draft includes a high daily fine for violations, which may be higher compared to other ordinance violations.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 6764332, "chunk_end_time": 7181114, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKvgAJituIk", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKvgAJituIk&t=6764s"}, {"start": 104000, "end": 110000, "text": "to be the same address.

That's a higher fine per day than some other ordinance violations, but you're not sure why it's got the range. My personal opinion would be to leave the fine numbers out of it because we already have code enforcement. We can do. We already have rules on the books for code enforcement, but I certainly wouldn't suggest it going higher than what it's in there. Now, if you thought, hey, a thousand is too high as a minimum, I don't think that's actually the minimum anyway, probably, but, you know, you could put it from zero to 1500 or something. I'd feel better about that. Well, and it says. It doesn't say shall, so it makes it. It says will. And this is a very lawyer y thing, but other, other parts of the code say shall I find shall be lobby as opposed to will. And then I just couldn't understand why it would be 1000 to 1500 rather than just being 1000 or 1500. But we don't know where that came from. Yeah, I'll just be honest. Well, actually, I can speak to that chair, graves, if you'd let me. That is actually from the, as Chris, I think, said earlier, it is from our first go around with ADU. And one of the reasons why it was set at that higher rate, at that higher level is because there was this issue of wanting to make a strong statement about the enforceability of this ordinance and that violations of it have real consequences. So that's why it's set the way it is. You can set it at whatever, it doesn't have to be in there because generally the code has its own penalty provisions anyway, but it was specifically put in there to make it very clear that this is going to be a very strictly enforced ordinance. And where violations are found, there is a significant penalty attached to those. Given the impact of the, the use on neighboring uses and things like that. I'm good with leaving it. I guess my question should it say shall be? Shall be again? Because I'm just looking at consistency with other ordinance provisions I drafted that I typically use a stronger word, will. But if the preferences. Shell. It can be shell if you think will is stronger. That's why I just, again, was looking at consistency. I'm good with Will. Okay. And so the 1500 would be discretion of staff. And again, you made the point, Chris, that that has to be enforced. A judge has to agree to it. Right. Okay. I guess I kind of wonder why it's in this. Why would we, why would we have it in this ordinance? It's just sort of like the parking thing. These things probably get covered elsewhere and then just, just add a reiteration that, you know, these are enforced. These are, this is. We want these to be done correctly and you must follow the rules. I mean, you know, about being notified by your neighbors. I didn't have to notify my neighbors when I added onto my house, but I also had my permits hanging all over my house. And I was inspected on every single aspect. Yeah. So I had check offs. So I got my money back and there was, they were not light footed me. And so, and back to you about the family thing about, well, you could have this kid, three kids, this whatever, but the owner still has to occupy one or for sure, there has to be an owner there. So I think that gets to the enforcement because I think that's the question is how will that be enforced? So if, if the owner, if the owner moves out, what's the. And it becomes a. I guess at that point, it becomes a g when it's registered and it goes with the house. Right? Isn't that what we said? Yep. They get registered and that enforcement follows with the house. Yeah. That gets recorded on the. Someone violates it, though. What is the recourse? Is it just a fine? I mean, you can't force. You can't force somebody to move back into the house. Presumably it's going to be fine. That's all you. That's all you have in this game. Yeah. So from a staff, we're fine with the enforcement language that's in there. From a staff perspective. Yeah. Okay. So far we only have the thousand square foot is probably our chance at this point. First you made the comment about one family detached dwelling. In the definition is that. Is that we're questioning. Is that the words attached? Correct. In there? Yeah. Where was that? That's. Well, it was in. It was on your PowerPoint, which I think came from 353-1001 number three, I see a principal, one family detached dwelling. So that it shouldn't have detached on there. Shouldn't have detached. I think that might be in there more than once for that. So that's just a. We'll look through that throughout. Do we need to have that in our change? I think that. I think we can leave that to steph because that's kind of a scrivener thing to just reconcile it. And what's the definition of livable space? Is there an ordinance definition of livable space that I think is really more of a building code? I mean, it's the area of the rooms and the hallways and. Yeah. Interior. There's a definition. Yeah.

That's all the next thing that says. It's basically separable. Okay. If something is wrong with a part of the ordinance, then the rest of it remains.

So we've just got that. We've just got just. Other than some kind of conforming changes, we just got that one substantive change. Yeah. So it's really like Craig's motion that he was about to make. I mean, I think that's really where we're at in terms of the changes you wanted to make. It's the 1000 sqft for a coach house. Basically setting the 1000 shot here. I'll make a motion to recommend the ordinance as written. With the findings and facts of staff. With a change to the coach house section. Indicating that it is the lesser of 1000 livable space.

Remind me, Jennifer, was that April 23? No, I'm putting you on the spot calendar. But it'll be the next available date. We can get it on. We just have to do it by Friday. Basically. If we can get it done by Friday, it'll be on. So. Yeah, well, it's not a lot. I mean, April 23. Yes. Yes. So that's what we're shooting for. April 23 is coming in the hole. Okay. All right. That concludes. Is there any old business. Sorry, I forgot we have to follow the rest of my premature. Is there any own business. Is there any new business reports and communications director's report? I have nothing for today. Okay. Other reports, upcoming applications. Sean, we have a variance for a sign for McDonald's. That would be down by the Coles and target. Basically, the sign would be too close the way they're proposing it. I keep wondering when. They're asked to be 150ft. But they want to reduce it to 105. Because it's not a very compact lot. So that's why I said, will that be at the next 24th on that one. Okay, so that is getting closer to maybe starting. I keep wondering. Well, they could start the McDonald's without putting the sign in right away. And so that next meeting is the 24th. So that will be on the agenda. Yes. The notice has gone out. The staff report is done. For all intents and purposes. It might start to be polished a little bit. But I'm sure I did forget one thing. I've got my municipal minute from Ansel blank here. And there is a house bill, 4213 at the house Illinois house right now. It's a adu bill, local. Basically, they're considering prohibiting cities from limiting Adus. And yes, it prohibits cities from prohibiting adus. Right. But it doesn't really say to what extent yet. So there's that. There's also a judicial review of zoning decisions. Another bad bill. It kind of takes control away from cities. But anyway, those are out there just letting go. Public comment. There is staff here, but no members of the public, so no public comment. So adjournment is in order. I moved to adjourn. Second commissioner Wermuth and Commissioner Moyer, all in favor say aye. Aye. Well done. Good night. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody. And I had a baby last Tuesday. It's Alessi Perez Loken. Alessi. Alessi. A l E S S I. So we've got a Ulani and Alessi. Tuesday at 07:10 p.m. eight pounds, 1oz. Eight pound.

I'm calling this meeting to order at 06:01 here in council chambers. We do not have remote electronic attendance this evening, so we begin with an oath of office for promotional appointment of Omar Morelos Alvarado to the rank of police officer, effective March 4, 2024. In chief. I'll bring Omar forward. Thank you, mayor and council. Good evening. These are always exciting times for us at the police department. Omar is completing a probationary period and now be a fully commissioned police officer for the Moline Police Department. He was hired May 3 of 2022. Omar attended Mulling High School, another homegrown individual here for the mulling police department. Certainly excited about that. He played soccer, wrestling, and track in high school, attended Graceland University and Blackhawk College. He's also a member of the Illinois National Guard and joined the 1640 4th Transportation Unit in Rock Falls, Illinois, and as a motor transport operator. He actually was a little delayed in completing his probationary period because he had a significant injury while serving in the military. So we certainly thank him for his service to our country and the sacrifices that him and his family make that way. As well as being an esteemed member of our department, Omar has a background in law enforcement. He began working as a correctional officer with the Rock Island County Sheriff's Department. I'm sorry, Rock County Sheriff's Department in Janesville, Wisconsin, and then came to the Rock Island County Sheriff's Department later. After that, Omar speaks fluent Spanish and is often asked to help translate for the Mullein police Department. His hobbies include lifting weights, jiu jitsu, and martial arts, so if anybody wants to wrestle afterwards, he's available. He's joined here this evening by his dad, Manuel, his grandmother Guadalupe, his fiance Santana, and, of course, the prize of the show, his baby Mary, in the background here. So, mayor, if you would minister the oath office, I would be honored. Raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Omar Morales Alvarado. I, Omar Morales Alvarado. Have you been duly appointed as a police officer? Having been duly appointed as a police officer for the city of Moline, Illinois. For the city of Moline, Illinois. Do solemnly swear.

We do have some explanations on under number seven questions on the agenda, you'll note that Mister Silverman passed out this document to you, and if you haven't had a chance to read it thoroughly, we'll make sure there is time when we get to this item but it does require us to pull items 15.115.2 and 15.3 off of the consent agenda to our regular agenda in the regular meeting so that we can amend this development agreement so that it meets everyone's needs. But we stick on our timeline, which is very important for Mister Nelson and Parr. Any questions there? Okay. And just to be clear, this will, this, we will consider this. We'll need a motion to amend on item 15.1, correct? Yes. Okay. All right, move to our cow. Agenda items 8.1 resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an intergovernmental agreement for professional consulting services between and amongst the cities of Moline, Illinois, Rock Island, Illinois and Davenport and mosaic community planning for a regional analysis of fair housing choice impediments for the purpose of sharing the cost to develop a regional analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. AIfhc. Go ahead, Miss Whitley. Thank you. Good evening, everybody. As you know, the city of Mole is one of the 1300 HUD entitlement communities. We have been an entitlement community since the CDBG program began. And again, CDBG is a community development block grant. That's what that stands for. So since 1974, when we got our 1st $151,000, our entitlements have ranged anywhere from 151,000 to a little over a million. So they really go up and down every year. But as an entitlement community, we're required to submit a five year consolidated plan. Our consolidated plan is similar to your strategic plan where we're gonna talk about the community needs, housing, economic development and infrastructure. So as I write that plan, I have to collect data. And so HUD requires us to do a housing needs assessment report and they require us to do an analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. So tonight we're proposing two consultants, one where they're going to work in partnership, but one's going to take the lead on the analysis of impediments and the other one is going to take the lead on the housing needs assessment. Now, Mosaic, they wrote our plan five years ago for the analysis of impediments. So we have worked with them before. I have both consultants on the line. So I would like to introduce Jeremy Gray and then Maria Byler. So Maria or Jeremy, who wants to go first? Hi. I can go first. Good evening, mayor. Members of council, appreciate the opportunity to join you for tonight's meeting. AJ had just asked us to very briefly kind of give you an overview of the two different reports that our firms are going to be working on. And so I will do that. Happy to answer questions you may have, but I don't want to take too much of your time to get into the details of it here either. KJ did a good job explaining the analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. It is a requirement, it's a condition of the CDBG funds that the city receives from HUD every year. And so the US Department of Housing and Urban Development expects the city to complete one of these every five years. My firm, Mosaic, did prepare the comparable plan five years ago. It also was a joint effort between the three entitlement cities. So Moline, Davenport and Rock island worked together on that. Really, it's a pretty data intensive analysis, and that data comes from two primary sources. One of those sources is from the community. So there is a pretty substantial community engagement element to this hearing from people throughout the city of Moline, throughout the quad cities about their housing challenges, experiences, barriers they may face to housing choice, and comparing that public input that we hear with the data that we look at, hard data from the census, or there's mortgage lending data that we look at. There's lots of other sources of that data that I won't go into here, but putting all that together, determining what the story it's telling us is, and then we develop a set of recommendations for the following five years. And this is kind of where this plan interfaces with the consolidated plan that KJ just mentioned to you. So we will set up some recommendations for actions that the city can take to further fair housing choice, expand housing options for people who do live. And will, we will work on that collaboratively with KJ and other members of the consortium here that's working on it. So we won't come to you and propose action items that you're not comfortable with, but we will work with you to, based on what we hear and what the data is telling us here, what can we put together that would address maybe this barrier or this impediment that we've identified? So that is kind of briefl", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Moline", "insights": [{"observation": "Moline lead service line replacement project.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Communities collaborated to share the cost to develop a regional analysis of impediments to fair housing choice.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Proposing two consultants to work on the analysis of impediments to fair housing choice and housing needs assessment.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Substantial community engagement element to gather public input on housing challenges and barriers.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Moline Commission on Youth", "insights": [{"observation": "Reappointment of board members for the Moline Commission on Youth.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Mosaic Community Planning", "insights": [{"observation": "Mosaic is taking lead on analysis of impediments, proposing recommendations to address barriers or impediments identified.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Moline", "insights": [{"observation": "Moline lead service line replacement project.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Communities collaborated to share the cost to develop a regional analysis of impediments to fair housing choice.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Proposing two consultants to work on the analysis of impediments to fair housing choice and housing needs assessment.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Substantial community engagement element to gather public input on housing challenges and barriers.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Moline Commission on Youth", "insights": [{"observation": "Reappointment of board members for the Moline Commission on Youth.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Mosaic Community Planning", "insights": [{"observation": "Mosaic is taking lead on analysis of impediments, proposing recommendations to address barriers or impediments identified.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 361142, "chunk_end_time": 800434, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEy9lIPbHS4", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEy9lIPbHS4&t=361s"}, {"start": 9000, "end": 15000, "text": "ata that we look at, hard data from the census, or there's mortgage lending data that we look at.

So that is kind of briefly what our study is about. And I can let Maria talk a little bit more about the housing needs assessment as well. Thanks, Jeremy. Good evening, your honor. Good evening, council. Happy to be here. Today I'm representing points consulting. We're a real estate, economic and community development consulting firm based out of Moscow, Idaho. So we're going to be conducting the housing needs assessment for you all. And it is somewhat similar to what Jeremy's describing. He did a really good job coincidentally describing the housing needs study, except for us. It's a little bit more market oriented. So we're looking at where your gaps are, where your needs are, and then making recommendations for actions you can take based off of that. So we look at a lot of different things. We like look at demographic data, what's the housing that is planned in your area? What do you currently have? It's all about that balance of supply and demand. And we're also going to be conducting a survey to hear from the community about what they think is needed and what their challenges are. And I'm also happy to take any questions you might have about this. Anything further, Miss Whitley? No. Once. Just one more thing. Once I receive that data, I finished my report. My report then goes to out for public comment, then it goes to our Cacup board, then it comes to council, and then it goes up to HUD. Now with that being said, technically my report is due to HUD on November 16 of this year because they get it 45 days before the beginning of our year. Well, just to let you know, we haven't even got our allocation for 2024 yet, so I have not even bought that plan to you guys yet. Even though they just approved the T HUD bill, they have to do the formula and then decide how much each entitlement is going to get. And then once we are made aware of that information, then I have 60 days to complete that report and go through the whole process. So we're kind of jumping on the 25 before we get done with the 24, but that's just kind of how the regulations read. So I just have to prepare my report like I'm going to submit it on November 16. Chances are it probably won't be submitted on November 16 because that's the only day that I can submit it. Because you can't submit it before November 15, but you have to submit it 45 days before your calendar year begins. But we have to prepare and go through our actions like we're going to submit it. So once these reports are completed by the consultants, if you approve them tonight, we'll come back and do a formal presentation to you with that data. Thank you. Thank you. Do you have more to add before we do a motion? Sure. Just for. Just for sake of moving things along tonight, items 818283 and eight, four are all collectively the items related to the intergovernmental agreements with the city of Moline, Rock island and Davenport, as well as the agreements professional services, both with Mosaic as item 8.2 and then with points consulting, item 8.4. So we won't be speaking to each and every one of these items unless there's specific questions. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Motion by Timian, seconded by Finch. Thank you. Discussions from the council. Miss Castro, you had mentioned that there was going to be a housing needs survey. I'm curious how that's going to be sent out just to make sure that everyone, or the people, maybe most in need, actually see that survey. Absolutely. That's a really great question. So we really like to work with the individual communities to make sure that everyone has access to that survey. So we have. Typically we distribute an online survey as well as potentially paper copies, depending on where that need might be. The primary mode of advertising that we tend to use is social media, just because we find that it's widely accessible and has a broad reach. But we also like to work with the individual cities to utilize their avenues. They like to get out information to folks as well. So really it is tailored to each individual's circumstance. But we want accessibility be a big component of this. Okay, thank you. We'll need to make sure then that there's a conversation around that distribution. I know we have had things here in city hall, maybe the library. All of those details should be talked about by staff, Mister Timin, especially with the housing needs, since we've used the same partners twice now, and maybe more, would it be appropriate to draw conclusions based on trends? You know, could we compare these to the results from five years ago and now to see the demand has gone up? Therefore, I mean, that could really influence policy decisions that we make. Seeing a trend going up or down one way or the other, is that something that you'd be able to get us high level? Maria, do you want to answer that? Yeah, absolutely. So we are aware of previous reports and they will be serving as a baseline for our reports.

And hopefully you'll be able to see some of the results of your hard work that you've done. Okay. Thank you. Is there anything further from the council hearing? None. All in favor? Any opposed? That motion passes 8.2. A resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a consulting agreement between Mosaic Community Planning LLC and the city of Moline, Illinois, for the 2024 regional analysis of impediments to fair housing choice to complete a study that will provide essential housing and community needs for the development of a 2025 of the 2025 to 2029. Consolidated plan motion to approve second motion by Schmidt, seconded by Castro. Discussion hearing none. All in favor? Any opposed? That motion passes 8.3, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an intergovernmental agreement for professional consulting services between and amongst the cities of Moline, Illinois, Rock Island, Illinois and Davenport, Iowa, and points Consulting, LLC for a regional housing needs assessment for the purpose of sharing the cost to develop a regional housing needs assessment. HNA motion to approve motion by Finch, 2nd 2nd by Macias discussion hearing none. All in favor? Any opposed? That motion passes 8.4, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a professional services agreement with points Consulting, LLC for a housing needs assessment to research and develop a regional housing needs assessment for the cities of Moline, Illinois, Rock Island, Illinois and Davenport, Iowa. Motion to approve second motion by Finch, seconded by Razak. Need discussion hearing none. All in favor? Any opposed? That motion passes. 8.5, a resolution authorizing the mayor and city clerk to execute and attest to an intergovernmental agreement for temporary wastewater treatment plant operations and maintenance for the East Malin Regional wastewater treatment plant buy in between the city of Moline and the city of East Moline. Mister Vitas? Yeah, very briefly. As you know, for several months we've been working with the City of East Moline and providing basically management and oversight of their wastewater treatment plant during the absence of their class one operator. Going forward is our understanding as of today that they have found a new class one operator who is commencing employment with the city. But until such time that that person is fully, I guess, adapted to the new plan and comfortable in operating it, we will continue to provide services to them as we have the past several months. So we're recommending approval of the agreement until such time is not needed, and we would advise you when that happens. Motion to approve second motion by Schmidt. Second if I resolve. Okay, discussion. Thank you for helping us do more regional work. Well, the goal is to look at regionalization when it comes to public utilities, so this is just kind of all the stepping stones are happening. Thank you. Anything further from the council hearing? None. All in favor? Any opposed? That motion passes 8.6, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a pipeline license with Burlington Northern Santa Fe railway company, BNSF, which authorizes the city to access storm culverts located within the railroad right of way to perform maintenance work, and authorizing the director of utilities to execute any and all necessary documents related to this work. Pretty much a straightforward agreement. Anytime you conduct any type of maintenance work, above or below any rail line. They do require that there is a license in place. BNSF is no exception. And this would be so that we can clean the two major culverts underneath the railroad and the outfall sewers that go to the Mississippi river just to the west of the marina. Catfish Charlie's? I believe it is. So that's what we're looking for. Thank you. Motion to approve. Second motion by Finch, seconded by Castro. Discussion on the council hearing, none. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? That motion passes 8.7. A resolution authorizing the mayor and city clerk to execute an attest to an agreement between the city of Moline and the Rock Island County Sheriff's office to jointly acquire and utilize certain public safety equipment. We brought this up at the last meeting, and we just failed to have a motion in a second, but we voted, so we're bringing it back. And this is for the camera, security camera equipment that the police chief and our Rock Island county sheriff have concurred and agreed to share in the cost and in the utilization of. Yes, go ahead. Motion to approve. Second motion by Schmidt, seconded by cash. I will say this is a rare occurrence.

That motion passes. Thank you. We move to our informational Mister Vitas, the March 2024 status and information report. Yes, thank you very much, mayor, members of council, I will be brief, since you've had the report since last week Friday, and if you have questions, please reach out. But I want to compliment again the staff for staying on track, keeping the course, you know, and reporting out monthly on not only our strategic goals that are being met, but just as importantly, all of our non strategic efforts that go on that support, you know, everyday operations in the city. As you can see, human resources continue to recruit, continue to hire new employees. The LGBTQ plus training attendance is taking place through the HR department. We have a new HR manager who will be joining us, I believe, next week, and that person will be charged primarily with the training operations of the city so that we can really reach out to our 400 plus employee workforce. The park and rec master plan. If you haven't seen it, please see Eric. But that is done. The parkour did approve it. And that will guide us in terms of where we go with investments in the parks long term, which is really, really crucial. And then, of course, public works safety training. I want to thank you for that. Denver, getting that done. Safety first was always the motto on the railroad when I worked there. And they were serious about it. So I hope we're as serious. It's very important that we keep our workforce safe. So if there's other questions, I'm more than happy to answer them. Or get answers if I shouldn't have that tonight. Council comments, questions. I also want to thank you for the creativity. I noticed you're looking into snow removal volunteers, and this is something the community speaks to me about once in a while. Thank you for looking at that. And also some of the, like you said, non strategic, like as in not associated with the strategic plan, but the communication plan you have for helping people know what's going on with public works, especially around our huge snowstorm. I thought that was really effective and helpful. Thank you. And thank you for moving on. A lot of the staff training that we've been wanting to see. It will all happen. Anything further? All right. I will close out that committee, the whole, and bring our regular council meeting to order. Pledge of allegiance, please.

I'm going to, I think, council, would it be good if I read this out in its entirety? Just that way we all have the chance to hear it and read it at the same time. So 15.1 is an ordinance authorizing the mayor and city clerk to execute and attest to a redevelopment and economic incentive agreement between the city of Moline and par instrument company related to the East Gate TIF redevelopment project area. Mister PTas, anything to add before we move to move motions? It would be hard not to add. And I know everybody wants to always get out early, but I think. I think we need to take a moment just to reflect on where we've been. You know, Jim Nelson is here from par instrument, for those of you who may have not met him, that is Jim sitting next to, you know, our CeD director, Mister Mathias, and Tony Lode, both of whom, all three of whom played an integral role in making this become a reality, along with our attorney, David Silverman, myself, as well as Alex Elias. And pretty much there are others who are involved, and there were probably others on the other side at the table as well. Multiple attorneys, just a lot of players. This is probably one of the more complex arrangements that I think the city's ended into in quite a few years. Maybe one of the only industrial projects that we've actually done in Ativ in decades. And I want to thank Jim for his patience with this city all these years and sticking with us after 125 years and for the next 125, congratulations. This project means a lot to the city in terms of the redevelopment of the east end of this city and launching what has been a very quiet area into something that will be more momentous and more enjoyable to visit in future years. I wish Pat O'Brien was here. Care to see this? We shared many discussions about the east end of this city, and I think he's looking down. He's proud of this moment probably more than anyone else. But this project, $22.7 million project, will allow par to remain here at 52nd street and 53rd street and expanding by building a 54,000 square foot manufacturing edition in phase one and then going back in phase two and renovating their entire 44,000 sqft that they have traditionally worked from for decades. The city's commitment to this, of course, was to provide for the stormwater management. We're going to clean out those pipes. The water will flow better, Jim, and you could thank Tony. He's the one behind all that. But at the end of the day, we made some big commitments on our end to improve not only the stormwater, to benefit our instrument, but it does benefit that entire east end of the city, which traditionally did have water issues, both residentially and otherwise. So rather than belabor it, you have all the data in front of you. We've shared everything we can, and David will speak to this modification, which is an absolute must, and it is very common in development agreements. And it came to us in the wee hours of this afternoon in this format, and we're presenting that as an amendment as well. So with that, thank you, mayor, for the opportunity to speak. Would you like to speak to us now? Sure. Thank you. So what I put in front of each of you is new language that would be, that will go into the RDA. And this is why we had to pull the items off consent because of an amendment that will be needed, that will reflect like this. But last Friday afternoon, we were alerted by some of pars attorneys, and you have plenty of attorneys working on this project and big bills that this language would need to be added to ensure the finance, the private sector financing is secured for the project. The intent of the language is to establish a priority lien in favor of the private sector lenders and investors in the project. What that means practically for the city is our lien becomes subordinate to the private sector lien without this language, as Bob indicated, this is a significant amount investment and expansion of operational capacity for bar. But there was the potential that $20 million could have been pulled from the project. There was a flurry of activity, but it was ultimately decided, I think, quite rightly, that this investment is very important for the city. You keep a long standing moline business in the city. You enable them to modernize and expand their production facility facilities and create new employment opportunities. We also measured the risk as being pretty low that we would ever need to exercise our lien rights, and we do have other rights within the agreement that is not affect", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Rock Island County Sheriff's Office", "insights": [{"observation": "A resolution authorizing the mayor and city clerk to execute an attest to an agreement between the city of Moline and the Rock Island County Sheriff's Office to jointly acquire and utilize certain public safety equipment.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "City of Moline", "insights": [{"observation": "An ordinance amending chapter 32, vegetation of the mulling code of ordinances, article two trees, by repealing said article two in its entirety and enacting, in lieu thereof, one new article two, dealing with the same subject matter to align with the urban forestry management plan.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Par Instrument Company", "insights": [{"observation": "An ordinance authorizing the mayor and city clerk to execute and attest to a redevelopment and economic incentive agreement between the city of Moline and par instrument company related to the East Gate TIF redevelopment project area.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "$22.7 million project will allow par to remain here at 52nd street and 53rd street and expanding by building a 54,000 square foot manufacturing edition in phase one and then going back in phase two and renovating their entire 44,000 sqft that they have traditionally worked from for decades.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The city's commitment to this, of course, was to provide for the stormwater management.

We also measured the risk as being pretty low that we would ever need to exercise our lien rights, and we do have other rights within the agreement that is not affected by this. So with that, I did include the exact language that was provided by their attorneys in there. I'm not going to read it, but the intent of the language is, as I explained, it secures the $19.8 million in private sector financing that is a combination of traditional bank loans as well as something known as new market tax credits. These meetings have been crazy. Jim has certainly been on the ones that I've been on, and there's like 35 people on these calls, and it's a lot of work, and it generates like 720 emails a day. At least. You're probably getting more of it than I am. So that's why we pulled it. We did. Obviously, this is a slightly changed document from what was presented last time we were here talking about this. And so we will need an amendment to include a new subsection eleven l on page 19 of the RDA just above section twelve. All right, so we do not have the motion on the floor yet. I've just. First. Yep. Thank you so much for that explanation. Can we have a motion to put this item on the floor? Motion by schmidt, second by timian. Thank you. Discussion. This is where I will read out what this new language is. So it is l priority lien rights notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, the city acknowledges and agrees that any security interest granted to the city in subsection eleven j of this agreement and any subsequent agreement or filing shall be subordinate in all respects, regardless of the date of this agreement or any UCC financing statement related thereto to the liens of CBKCDC sub CDE 73, LLC, and FPCD sub CDE 24, LLC. Together project lenders end quote. In certain of the collateral senior liens. End quote. The senior liens have been or will be granted to project lenders pursuant to that certain construction mortgage security agreement, fixture filing and financing statement to be executed by par instrument Real Estate, LLC, pire, end quote. And recorded against a portion of the property as security for loans in the aggregate. Original principal amount of 19 point million $800,000 provided to pire to finance a portion of the redevelopment project. So with that new language, we need a motion to amend as presented by corporation council subsection l on page 19 above, section twelve. Yes, so moved. Second. That is a motion to amend, correct? Yes. Seconded by Mister Timian. Discussion. Yes. Mister Schmidt. Yeah, this makes sense. I'm glad we're making the changes we need to. I'm tracking all that, and I don't want my question to make it sound like I'm expecting any problems with the project, but I'm just wondering if you could walk us through a little bit of understanding what's the scenario in which this sort of plays out and how that plays out. I just really want to be able to understand. So if I'm asked about, I can have that. Jim, close yours. I'm sorry to put that to the world. I really am. I can put it. Maybe you want to. The scenario would be if par went belly up and we had no way to recapture money because of any breach of the agreement. The project's unfinished. We have lien rights that are established in here, but we also have other rights on top of those lien rights that are not affected, as I explained a minute ago by this language. But what's key for the lenders is they want to make sure they have a priority lien. So if power went belly up and we were sitting there and unable to get back the public investment that's been made into the the project, our lien would be subordinated to the private sector entities who would be first in line to recapture off any of the collateral available in the property and personal equipment. That possibly means that the city would have to take a lesser amount than it actually has in the project. We assess this risk as being very low, but that's the practical effect of that language. As a leading manufacturer of the kind of instruments you make, I can understand that assessment. Yes, we understand. Is that seven years, that will go away, right? That's right. So it is a planning period. Thank you. Any further questions on this amendment? Yes, Mister Schmidt. Number two. Thank you for the. Excellent. That is just very helpful to understand. This is coming through. And good to know that it is such a low risk. So thank you. Anything further from the council? All right, so we'll take a vote on this amendment. First roll call, please.

A public alley in block four in CG Toulin's second addition to East Moline and portions of right of way of Second Avenue and 52nd street. Motion to approve second motion by Finch, seconded by Macias. Discussion very, very briefly. We are vacating the alley that runs between Fourth Avenue and Second 2nd Avenue. And it runs in between the existing building and the property that they've acquired. And it would also require the relocation of the power lines that run in between the two properties today. And that's part of the agreement. Thank you. Yes. Did I. I'm so sorry. One check. We have not put the motion on the floor yet, correct? No, we did do a motion in a second. I read it out. Sorry, I got out of order for 1 second. All right. Conversation. Yes, please. Mister Schumer, there's no substantial change to this. The only reason it was pulled from the consent was because it couldn't be passed before the other item. 15.1. That's right.

Bobby, David, appreciate all your help. Thank you. All right, so we are to our miscellaneous business. It's been a busy few weeks while we had a day off. My head is swimming in lots of information that misunderstood. Mister Vitas is continually updating me on. There's a lot of work going on toward the strategic plan, but I did want to update you. Renu Moline has been doing a great job just clicking things away for everything related to the JCPenney project. And downtown had a great PMT meeting this afternoon where we heard from new ventures advisors representatives about the Spiegel building project and what their scope of services will be and what we're hoping to get out of that. So that's significant development. To think that two and a half years ago we were just coming up with the first steps of this process and to know that we're already to this place where in a few months, by the end of the year, we're really going to have concrete information, information with which to make some major financial decisions. It's really amazing. So thank you to our partnership with renew for all of that and everything the staff is doing to help that happen. There was a miscommunication from the chamber about ribbon cutting this week with Ed Zimmerman, Honda. If you would like to reach out, I have contact information. I think it's worth supporting and recognizing another business that's really investing in Moline, at least in some of the sustainability goals that we have. They just put a huge solar project on their property, and the ribbon cutting happened to be 6 hours before what had been advertised, so it was missed. But I think, you know, if you feel like reaching out, especially if it's in your ward, I plan on reaching out and they're aware of the mistake. So anyway, we always want to make sure our businesses know we appreciate the work they're doing to invest in the city. I don't have anything further at the moment. If I think of something. Well, I will not forget to share it with you, miss murphy. No, I have nothing. Mister macias? Nothing, your honor. Mister razak? No, thank you. Mister timian? Nothing, your honor. Nothing, your honor. Mister finch? Nothing, your honor. Nothing, your honor. All right. Mister schmidt? Nothing, your honor. Mister vitas. I just want to point out that we have launched our initial task force discussions on the compass id program. So alderman macias has done a great job of. Of leading the discussions. He's not taking much credit for it yet, but the library staff is excited. They're working on it. They're planning on visiting Johnson county to at least see what they did there and not repeat any mistakes. So we are looking for a July implementation.

We're in full force for hiring for the new sewing pool. We've had over 80 applicants so far, and so our cashiers management is looking pretty good, but we're about halfway there for lifeguards, so please share that we. There's a QR code code on the back that you can scan and go right to the information, but we're the highest paying swimming pool in the quad cities for lifeguards. We will actually pay staff to take the lifeguarding class, and the class is also free if they come work for us and they refer one of their friends, and they work for us for the summer. We also have referral bonuses as well. So we're really excited. I'm excited to give a tour to everyone they do this spring, and we're just kind of plugging along with the swimming pool, so it's really exciting. Thank you very much, sir.

Okay, so we'll start with our presentations. Presentation of Life Saving award to Sergeant Tyler McLaughlin and Officer Tyler Lewis Bresnahan, chief golf. Thank you, mayor. The officers come forward. I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to recognize two very fine officers for some heroic deeds. On March 9, 2024, at 06:12 p.m. the Millennium Police Department received a 911 call of a traffic crash. Officers discovered that a 1999 Chevy s ten had gone off the road in the 2700 block of 6th Avenue, flipped over and crashed, but was able to continue driving to the 200 block of 43rd Street. Officer Lewis Brusn and Sergeant McLaughlin arrived and observed a damaged truck parked in the roadway with blood all over the truck and the ground. The driver was laying on the ground just outside the driver's side door and covered in bright red blood. He was barely conscious and unable to communicate. The passenger was kneeling down over the driver, screaming for help. Officer Louis Brosnahan began to administer first aid. Police found the driver's left arm badly injured. The flesh from the driver's arm from the middle of the bicep to just below the elbow was gone, exposing bone and tendons. It was evident that the driver had suffered massive trauma to his arm, including his brachial artery. Sergeant McLaughlin quickly took out his tourniquet and handed it to Officer Louis Bresnahan, who was now kneeling down on the driver's left side. He instructed Officer Louis Bresnahan to put the tourniquet on and assisted in manipulating it around the driver's arm. Officer Lewis Brezzahan finished securing the tourniquet high and tight on the driver's arm, which ultimately stopped the bleeding before Moline fire arrived on scene. Officer Lewis Bresnahan then assisted Moline fire with loading the driver up on the gurney. The driver was still in critical condition and was transported to the hospital. It was later learned that during the crash, the vehicle rolled onto the driver's side. The driver's left arm was out of the window and became pinned between the vehicle and the pavement and his arm. Was drug along the pavement with the vehicle on top of it for approximately 30ft. While at the hospital, the driver had lost so much blood that the veins in his upper extremities collapsed. The phlebotomist had to take medical blood drop from his foot. The hospital staff left the tourniquet that officer Louis Bresnahan had fixed on while the driver went through all the testing. During this, hospital, staff was replenishing the driver's blood and he was now conscious and alert. The driver ultimately had to be airlifted to another hospital. Officer Lewis Brazihan and Sergeant McLaughlin showed tremendous courage and training throughout the incident. Their actions and ability to stay calm and work together through an extremely chaotic and stressful situation are admirable. The driver was already unconscious when the police arrived, indicating he had sustained significant blood loss. A human can perish from arterial blood loss in as little as three to five minutes. Sergeant McLaughlin and Officer Lewis Presidenthan saved the driver's life during this incident. Their quick thinking and application of the tourniquet stopped the driver from bleeding out any more than he already had. Their immediate recognition of the arterial bleed and the need for a tourniquet to stop the bleeding was critical in saving of the driver's life. Sergeant Joe Cleaver nominated Officer Louis Presidenthan and Sergeant McLaughlin to be considered for the Millennium Police Department's Life Saving award. The nomination was reviewed by the awards committee and sent to the office of the police chief. After review of the award recommendation, I find that life saving awards should be bestowed upon Sergeant Louis president and Sergeant McAllen. I'm sorry. Officer Louis Bresnahan and Sergeant McGaughin. Both officers committed an act performed in the line of duty with prompt and alert action which resulted in saving a human life. So today I'm going to award them a certificate as well as a uniform citation bar to honor this occasion. And so they both read the same life saving award. The city of Moline Police Department awards to officer Titus Lewis Presenhan and of course, Sergeant Tyler McLaughlin. The lifesaving award for your bravery and heroic action that led to the saving of a human life as demonstrated on March 9, 2024.

Signed this day, April of 2024, by Chief of police, as well as a meritorious achievement bar which we placed on their uniforms above their name tags. So if I could just get a round of applause for this. Thank you very much. Thank you, chief. Our next item is our April 2024 neighbor of the month awards. Our commercial award goes to jeez, gourmet popcorn or John Gnatovich. I don't believe he's able to be with us here today, but I will pass this around the council so you can see his business in pictures. And we're thankful for all he does in that portion of the city. And the second one is for Oswaldo Ojeda Vargas from 1522 15th street. The residential award. Miss Whitley, good evening. So the city's neighborhood partnership committee, comprised of city staff from every department, accepts awards, nominations from the public throughout the year. During the months of April through October, we award those awards out up to one commercial and one residential business who has made improvements into their property. So G's popcorn up on 15th street and 15th Avenue there. What was that? The house is for my sister. Oh, yes, we're almost to that one. This one's the commercial. G's popcorn took advantage of one of our financial incentives that CED runs the facade program. So with facade dollars. So a combination of his personal dollars and a combination of facade dollars, he made the improvements up at G's popcorn. So that's a great collaboration and a great result up there on the commercial side, but on the residential side, that house is for my sister, not mine. Can you accept the award for her? Yeah. Sorry. This is what finance passed on to me, so we'll get that corrected. So this property up here is a residential property who has been taking care of property maintenance and made improvements into their property as well. So if you would like to step up so we can get a picture. Mayor, if you'd like to come down. Thank you. And again, if you would like to nominate a property, we do have it on our website where you can make your nominations, or you can call someone on the neighborhood partnership committee and tell us what your nominations are. And again, we award these out through April, through October. So for a residential and commercial property. Thank you. Our next presentation is the Isawa Water Ambassador Program award, gold level designation. Hi. Good evening, your honor council. I'm happy to be before you tonight. And I would invite Shawna Richardson. She's with Illinois section of AWww, to come forward. She has an award to present to the city of Moline. Moline is a 100 plus year member of AWWW, American Waterworks association. And I'd also like to invite Melissa Kodak and Liz Hansen. I'd like to have them receive the award because they're the. The team members that did the outstanding work to document our activities to garner the award. Wonderful. Thank you. Please come forward. Good evening. The Isawa Water Ambassador program was created to elevate public perception knowledge and consumer education of the water industry. The program aims to accomplish these goals by presenting a new communication platform of educational promotional content in a manner that's relevant, engaging and consistent among participants. There are three levels of standards, bronze, silver and gold. Each is determined based on the frequency and method of communication. This year, we are awarding 20 gold level water ambassadors and one silver awardee. Throughout the state of Illinois, I'm proud to present the city of Moline the gold Status Water Ambassador award. Thank you for your efforts in educating the public about our water systems and for the work you do to maintain safe and sustainable water for all. Congratulations. Oh, yeah. I believe you have another presentation, Mister lode, the 2024 Water Art contest winner announcement. Yes. And for this item, your honor, I'd like to. To have Charlie Brown, our environmental compliance manager, come to the podium. So 24 hours a day, day after day, week after week, year after year, the water division is working to make safe, healthy and great tasting water for the residents of Moline. And to celebrate that, and to kind of bring attention to them, we asked the third grade students of Moline this year to participate in an art contest with the theme of every drop matters. This year's we had seven schools participate. The way the contest works is each art class does a piece of art, and then the art teacher chooses the winner from the class and then the winner from the school. And then we put the school's winners up on Facebook where the whole city then votes. So our winner today is not just the best of her class, not just the best of her school. She's the best of the city. So with me today is Emery Powell. She is our winner this year. With her is her mom, Kelly, and her reluctant brother. Miss Ramire is a teacher of 25 years. In this talk, a teacher of 32 years. So I would like to thank both of them for helping Emory participate.

Let's just say for eternity, take it off the walk. So we'll just leave it up there so someday she'll be able to bring her grandkids to come and see. So please congratulate Emory and her. Are we gonna get our water misty in with it? Yes. There you go. Take a tour. Good job. Show it off. Matters shows a drop going. Nope. There we go. Perfect visualization. Well, thank you so much, mister Lodi. Especially the day after earth day, celebrating the work your staff does. Especially with our community is. Is a pleasure. Anything further? Just our proclamation. All right. Did you want to speak before I read it? No. Okay. So we move to item number six, a proclamation from the American Waterworks association to declare May 5 through 11 20 24 as drinking water week. The proclamation reads, whereas water is our most valuable natural resource, and whereas only tap water delivers public health protection, fire protection, support for our economy and the quality of life we enjoy, and whereas any measure of a successful society, low mortality rates, economic growth and diversity, productivity and public safety are in some way related to access to safe water, and whereas we are all stewards of the water infrastructure upon which future generations depend, and whereas, each resident of the city of Moline is called upon to help protect our source waters from pollution, to practice water conservation, and to become involved in local water issues by learning about this valuable resource. Now, therefore, I, Sangeetha Rayapatti, mayor of Moline, do hereby proclaim May 5 through 11th, 2024, as drinking water week. Thank you, your honor. I just. I think it's fitting that this week, where our field crews are out flushing fire hydrants throughout the city, to remember that the water system is not just a system for our use, for drinking and bathing and cooking and so forth, also a fire suppression system. And it's because of that that the piping and pumping and storage tankage and everything need to be sized appropriately. And if you remember, a week or so ago, we had a large leak on a large transmission main that caused a significant portion of the city to lose pressure, and then there was a resulting boil order. But I would just ask you to think about, as you make, as you ponder this proclamation that when you open your faucet, water is just going to come out and you just expect that to happen and it's going to disappear down the drain. And that's because there's many resources that have been dedicated by this council and many previous councils, appropriately, as well as team members, the hard working, dedicated staff that you all have allocated resources to maintain, keeping things going. So thank you. Thank you very much. All right, we move to number seven. Public comment. Chief Diane. All right, we have three minutes and chief has got me on the timer. Thank you. I have spoken before to the plan commission, and I will reiterate to you that I personally am opposed to the adusation. I know that we turned it down in 2023. We are back at it again at your request. At that point, I think that the citizens of Moline should be able to have a vote and decide if this is what they want. I also am concerned about what they can be used for. From reading the ordinance, it would appear that they can be used for other than residents. Residents is one thing, but having it as a barber shop or as an accounting office, I don't know if that is correct, if I'm interpreting correctly, but it would appear to me that that does not fit neighborhoods. So I'm very, very concerned about it. You know, there's a parking issue. There's the interest in people even wanting to buy housing if they know that something can pop up next to them unbeknownst to them. Why would you spend the money to buy something in Moline? So thank you very much. I'm sure I met my three minutes. Thank you. Thank you, Marcy. So you can come around? If there's a way to come around, that'd be good. We need you on the microphone. Hello, I'm Marcie Fosdick with the Quad City pickleball club. And this year my husband butch and I are the new tournament directors for the Quad City Classic. This is our 6th year and for the last three years the city of Moline has so graciously supported our tournament. Last year you gave us $5,000 and we're requesting 5000 again this year. This past year, through visit Quad Cities, they determined that the tournament, which lasted four days brought in $94,000 for the city of Moline. That's an increase of 30 some thousand dollars from the year before. So hopefully this year that'll increase. We're a nonprofit. I believe that you have packets because it'll be on the agenda 9.4.

I believe it shows in there all the different things that our club gives back to the community. We give free lessons for adults, free lessons for kids. We do camps, we partner with big brothers, big sisters. There's all different kinds of things that we do. Oh, I'm losing my train of thought. We also last year gave $5,000 back to k five different nonprofits. Let's see, I can read them. Big brothers, big sisters got 1000. The River Bend Food bank, Casei Quad City adaptive sports and humility of Mary. We gave each of those organizations $1,000. So what we make, we give back to the city. And we hope that you support us again this year. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay. My name is Joseph McCoy. I live here in Moline. Of course. And I have come to talk about the support for adus. If you're not aware, current rent for one bedroom in Moline averages $832 per month. This is a 21% increase from last year. The current market trend is only going to continue. Low income this year to qualify for low income is $50,150 per year. When I think about that, when my husband and I were starting out, that would have been a phenomenal salary to have at this point. That means you have to earn $24 per hour to meet that income. Our first year teachers in Moline and Rock island, which are the highest paid districts for first year teachers, doesn't even meet that income level. It is also important that we note that Moline is a landlocked city. We have a need for more housing without land options, buying land options, and Adus offers that with minimal visual impact and without adding to an area's sprawl. And Adus provide a more dispersed and incremental way of adding homes to a new neighborhood than other options, such as multi story apartment buildings. And as a result, it's often easier to get community support for Adus than for other housing types. But there's other important reasons for myself and for my husband. I want to stay in my home for as long as possible. And I know that if I have an adu that provides a separate living space for either family members or for somebody to come in. For example, I have a friend who has a young college student who's coming to the Quad Cities to do an internship and needs housing and is willing to stay somewhere and do chores. I look at this as multigenerational. I look at this as allowing families to stay in place as long as possible, and adus can be switched. So when I think of my husband and I as we age, we're not going to need our 1500 square foot house. We're going to need 600 sqft. So we could go into a smaller space and rent out our house and live off of what we are getting for that rent. Because as we all know, the cost of care for our elderly is only going up. And so I just want to say that I am in support of Adus. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Hello everybody. Craig Loken, Moline citizen. Some of you I know, some of you I don't here to talk to you a little bit about some personal experiences on how Adus have helped me and my family moved here in 2021 with a newborn. And we were able to buy a beautiful home. It's our dream home. And in doing so, we were able to move in not only just my fiance's parents, but also her grandparents. What we didn't know at that time, and we would soon find out is that grandfather had cancer. Having an ADu, an internal Adu, which our house would technically qualify given the way the ordinance is written, allowed us an opportunity to take care of them, allowed us a central place for our family to come and join and spend those special moments. It also allowed me to lose not one, but two jobs. Since moving here, I had spent a career in banking spanning over ten years in Chicagoland area, and having an ADU with extra support allowed me to weather those two storms. Additionally, father who grandfather passed away, father was diagnosed with cancer last year, allowed us the extra support to be able to take him to his appointments and help him with his cancer treatments. I'm happy to say that he is now cancer free and absolutely wonderful to get that news. So there's certainly all sorts of reasons why it makes sense from both budget standpoint, not expanding the city, creating more affordable living spaces, but it also gives the opportunity for families to thrive when they otherwise would not be able to. So I support this ADU ordinance and I hope you all do too. Thank you. Hello, I'm Susanna Aguilar. I am here to support the Adus. I have a personal perspective into the reason why I support this, but also too, as another hat that I wear. As co chair of Floricente Association, I am a community advocate. So with Floricente being one of the oldest neighborhoods in Moline, we have quite a few properties that are already existing, grandfathered in as Adus. So that is two houses on one parcel. Growing up in Florida Cente, I have seen how generational family living goes, as well as the support that Adus give amongst the family. These are all people that add elements to our community and our workforce. These are all people that contribute to our way of living here in Moline.

These are all people that add elements to our community and our workforce. These are all people that contribute to our way of living here in Moline. My personal reason of why I have this is because I have a home in Floricente and I'm proud of it. It's my little castle. And with that, if I would want to have the choice to build on to it, I would want to do that. I've thought about it. Being a mother of four, do I need that extra room? Do I finish the attic? So that's extra living space for us? And then a year ago, my mom took a fall. Now that put me in a position of where I have to come to a control point of her independence. Do I wait for the second fall, the third fall? Where is the line in the guide for this? There isn't one. I've thought about this over and over again. Where is the transition before assisted living. Where is the transition to say, mom, it's okay and not it be, oh, I wish you lived closer. No, now you can live closer. You can be here. With that in mind, all within these couple years. I could also have a daughter that graduates college who needs affordable living, who may want to leave home and have a different transition and milestone. Whatever the reason is every decision that we make as community advocates have a domino effect. Just this one decision covers our seniors, our young adults, our children, and of course, adulthood, middle aged. And not everything that we provide touches all those spaces, as I just mentioned. But Adus do. Thank you. I'm Susanna Aguilar. Proud mom, proud daughter, and also proud moliner. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you very much. That concludes our public comment. We move to item number eight, questions on the agenda. I do want to point out that item 9.6, which is the development agreement for the JCPenney building, is on the both agendas. So it's on twice. It shows up as 19.4 in the regular meeting. And normally we have that little notice written there that it will show up on the other one. Got missed this time. But I double checked with administrator vitas today, and as is with the case when we do that, that is all because of a timing issue with the. That is correct. So I wanted you to be aware. So with that, we'll move to our committee of the whole agenda items 9.1. A resolution authorizing the chief of police to execute an equipment sharing agreement between the city of Moline and the city of Rock island to jointly acquire and utilize certain public safety equipment. Chief, anything? Oh, Mister Vitas, I have the chief explain it. It's a high tech piece of equipment. Seeking approval. We've been working on this for approximately six or eight months. And Deputy Chief Rya is here as well. Can answer some questions. He was previously in charge of lieutenant. Lieutenant in charge of investigations and through our work in our gun unit. Not our fun unit, which is misspelled in the place. Much more fun than the fire department. But anyway, they do a lot of collaboration with other cities. And through his work with Rock island, the Rock Island Criminal Investigation Division also was looking for this to continue working on the biometrics aspect to firearms and other violent crime issues. This exact same agreement was negotiated with Rock Island. I did get some input from Alderman Macias on this as well. They agreed to that as well, and it went through their council last night. So just seeking approval for us to move forward in a joint venture with Rock island. Thank you. Motion to approve second. Thank you. That's motion by Finch, seconded by Castro, discussion the council. Mister Schmidt, I'm supportive and as always, I'm appreciative, chief of your attention to concerns. And this can be something that can be very scary as our community goes into, and I think you've done a good job here of laying that out how it is protecting our citizens as well, from the police function as well, ensuring that it's not leading to any sort of misuse as well. So I really appreciate that from you and the whole department. So thank you. Yeah, it was one of the, I wanted to meet with some of the stakeholders to make sure that we evaluated all those, and I think we have accomplished that. You know, the one general thing I will point out here is that this is an investigative lead. This is not a probable cause tool. And so we added some additional ethical safeguards in there, the MOU, to address some of those issues. And I certainly proud of that work. And I think it'll be a good piece of equipment that we can still use within our community standards. Thank you. Anything further from the council hearing? None. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Motion passes. Thank you. 9.2.

Denver, Mister Schmidt. Wait, is it Mister Vital? No, we're gonna let Mister Schmidt take it away. Thank you. Good evening. So as part of our capital replacement plan, we are requesting and seeking approval to enter a contract with Sourcewell. Sourcewell is a nationally recognized purchasing cooperative. Basically, they seek bids in a public manner similar to how we seek bids, and then governments can take advantage of those contracts. We are looking to purchase this aerial ladder truck. Current lead times to build and give us the truck is approximately three to four years. So we're seeking to enter agreement now, build the truck, and eventually get that. Probably about 2028. As part of that, we're looking to it to enter now because there is a 6% increase for that contract. So with the higher price, that's approximately $127,000 increase. So we would like to do that because that takes effect May 1. Motion to approve. Second motion I Schmidt. Seconded by Timian. Discussion? Yes, Mister Timian. The reason that our current truck was. Had a shortened lifespan was overuse. And that's explained in the documents. Has that issue been remedied? We're not using it for non necessary applications. That is correct. The current ladder truck that we have only responds to confirmed structure fires. So this will be. The current ladder truck will hit that 2028 timeline without a problem. Because it's. Without a problem is a relative term. But it's not a daily driver anymore. No, it is not. Thank you. Anything further from the council, Harry? None. All in favor? Any opposed? That motion passes 9.3. A resolution authorizing a grant to Marcado on Fifth, Inc. For the amount of $20,000 from the special events fund to support the 2024 season of Marcado on fifth. I mean, Mister feet Thomas. Thank you, mayor. Thank you, council. Before you tonight is a resolution would authorize the grant request from Mercado on 50 incorporated for the amount of $20,000 for the upcoming 2024 season, which kicks off in May and runs through the end of September. This is the same amount that's been approved in prior years for Mercado. And we're recommending approval as requested this year. And that in future years, that there would be an MoU that would accompany this as a longstanding event in the city. An absent at Mou. We would not be recommending approval of the funding. Motion to approve. Second. That was Finch. Seconded by Castro. I think she got it. Thank you. Discussion, please. Hearing. None. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? That motion passes 9.4. A resolution authorizing a grant to the Quad Cities pickleball club for the amount of $5,000 from the special events fund to make the Quad Cities classic pickleball tournament not only successful for the club, but also for the city in bringing visitors to our community. Mister Vita, mayor and counsel, for all the reasons that Marcy brought up during her comments during public comment, we're recommending approval. Motion to approve. Second motion by Finch. Seconded by Schmidt. Discussion? Hearing? Non roll call. I mean. All in favor? Any opposed? Motion passes 9.5, a resolution authorizing the mayor and city clerk to execute and test to a purchase and sale agreement for sale of real estate with Peter McDermott for property located at 1719 5th Avenue, Moline, Illinois. PiN 0832-1003 for a purchase price of $25,000 and authorizing all appropriate city officials, officers, and staff to do all things necessary to complete each of the city's responsibilities and enforce each of the city's expected benefits, as referred to in such agreement. Mister Vitas, Madam mayor, members of council, we're recommending approval of the purchase of the Peter McDermott property on Fifth Avenue as presented here in the amount of $25,000 to one, create the pocket park on Fifth Avenue that exists today to take ownership as a city and two, tie that directly into, initially our relationship with Bush construction on the item that's forthcoming related to the redevelopment of JC Penney property and the potential future use by Western Illinois University for a daycare facility on the commercial portion of the building facing Fifth Avenue as a 3000 square foot area specifically for the young ones as required by law.

Mister Vitas mayor and council, at long last, take a breath. It's been a long ride. This project had had its start probably even before I got here in 21.

Thank you. Any motion to approve? Thank you. Second motion by Finch, seconded by Razak. Thank you. Discussion hearing? None. All in favor? Any opposed? That motion passes 9.6, an ordinance authorizing the mayor and city clerk to execute an attest to a redevelopment and economic incentive agreement by and between the city of Moline Renew Moline Properties LLC, 1701 series and 1701 5th Avenue LLC related to the Fifth Avenue TiF 15 redevelopment project area. Mister Vitas mayor and council, at long last, take a breath. It's been a long ride. This project had had its start probably even before I got here in 21. Much to her credit, Alex Elias had been studying residential development along the Fourth Avenue corridor to try and bring new residential living downtown. This property, though probably not directly a part of that study that was done, was directly adjoining it and was a parking lot and adjoining parking lot owned by at that time, the Riverstone group. Riverstone Group, to their credit, decided to donate this property to renew Mulwane and Renew Moline's leadership decided, through their board, to acquire this property for the intended purpose of redevelopment. At that time, this piece of property, of course, had stood vacant from the time that Riverstone had vacated the premise and built a new headquarters across the river. Working with Renew Moline, and working with the development partners at Busch Construction who actually were brought to us by renew Moline, we started a long journey with discussion about where could residential development happen along Fifth Avenue in particular, did not start at this location. It actually started further to the west. But that property became unavailable, and we then moved to the possibility that this property could become a residential development in our downtown, bringing additional, as I've always said, additional wallets and purses to the streets of Moline downtown to support our small businesses and to provide much needed housing, workforce level or rate housing downtown. So the project itself, before you tonight, will allow for the conversion of the vacant office to multifamily residential. There will be 32 market rate units that will be brought to the existing JC Penney building. That includes adding a third additional story somewhat recessed from the edge of the current building. Based on our form based code, commercial tenant area is planned to be a daycare run by Western Illinois University, and there is a letter agreement between Bush construction and Western University to that effect. And in the play area which you just previously approved is at 1719 5th Avenue and 3000. That lot would be reserved specifically for the daycare. To meet the legal requirements, the city approved the gap funding of this project of $2.8 million in the 2024 budget, which will be repaid through the new TIF district that this council created, TIF 15, which is the Fifth Avenue TIF. Bush has secured their letter of intent from Western Indian University to occupy, and I am mistaken, 4000 sqft, not 3000. The park space is 3000 and it's anticipated that the new TIF, created in March 2021, will be the basis for the refunding of the $2.8 million loan that the city is putting into this project. And I will note for those listening that this is the first time that the city has partnered to this level historically, at any time that I'm aware of in order to attract a project with the rising interest rates. When we started this discussion, interest rates were at 6%. By the time we got to the point of having a format, interest rates were at 7%. Where they're sitting at right now for construction loans, they are at 8%. So to Bush's credit, they are basically taking that 1% risk to try and get this project up and running it off the ground. So kudos to them for that. With that, we will be providing, over the course of the time, the last money will actually be the last money in be the first money in off the top. So kind of a LiFO approach, and they agreed to that. There's additionally, in addition to that, this would provide for eleven studio units at about 950 a month. One bedroom units. There's 19 one bedroom units at 1200, then two bedroom units, there are only two of those at $1,500. The city will also enter into a lease agreement with Busch construction for lot w 60 of the parking spaces there at $30. Well, it should be $35 a month. So make a correction. It's $35 a month, which is kind of the going rates. The same rate that we are working on charging the folks over at the service parking lot adjoining the renewed property, which they will retain. Parking lot they will retain, which will be uses a lay down yard, same rate that we're charging the Leclaire apartment building property. So with that, we're recommending approval of the agreement. I want to thank Alex, first and foremost for her desire to put a shovel in the ground. And I love to quote her on that, because it's the first thing she told me. She goes by, help me, God, there'll be a shovel in the ground while we work together. Well, this is the second one going in. Alex, congratulations. Thank you. To Bush and, of course, Mister Silverman and his diligence in working not only with the city staff, but working with the attorneys that represented both Bush as well as the attorneys that represented Renu.

To complete phase one engineering services for motor fuel tax, section 240-002-9600 SW River Drive. Streetscaping from 12th street to 19th street for an amount not to exceed $174,093. Mister Vitas? Yes. I'm happy to report that we are recommending approval of the agreement with Hutchinson, a local engineering company here in Moline. With moliners, actually. And this project is critical because it really kind of addresses a 31 year streetscape improvement that happened a long time ago along River Drive. If you've ever walked from one end of river Drive to the other, especially, for example, when we had the parade, Mercado parade, the day of the dead parade. It's tough to walk on that it's falling apart. It's basically beyond its useful life. So, that being said, this project is going to come up with a design to rebuild that entire streetscape along the entire length from the arena all the way over to 19th street, which is fantastic. And it also then is complimentary to our agreement that we entered into regarding the amusement tax, that dollars that we were collecting or receiving, the 3% that would somehow support and complement what our arena does. So this does then take into account that agreement. So we're really hitting killing two birds with 1 st. We're recommending approval of at least the initial design engineering for this project. Motion to approve. Motion by Macias. Seconded by fent. All right, discussion? Hearing? None. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? That motion passes 9.9. A resolution authorizing the mayor and city clerk to execute an attest to a contract with Porter Brothers Construction, Inc. For project 1464 2024, Sealcoat ditch restoration for the amount of $128,289.10. Mister Vitas, we are recommending approval of that amount to Porter Brothers as a part of our annual Sealcoat ditch restoration program, which is in the budget. Motion to approve? Second. All right. Motion by Finch. Seconded by Mesik. Discussion. I'm so sorry. I heard it incorrectly. It was a second instead of Macias. You got it. All right. Discussion? Hearing? None. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? That motion passes. 9.10, an ordinance amending chapter four, alcoholic liquor, of the mulling code of ordinances. Article three, retail licenses, division three, privileges conferred by various classes of licenses by enacting a new section 43318 entitled option five, package sales of beer and wine only for class A licensees, and consecutively renumbering the remaining sections of division three and amending article three, retail licenses, division two, licensing procedures, section four, 3208, license fees by adding fee information for the new option five. Legal counsel. Legal counsel, please. Miss Castapo. Thank you. We haven't looked at chapter four for a while, but it was brought to our attention that expansion and that package sales for class licensees may assist in business success. So we bring forward tonight a proposed amendment to chapter four for your consideration, which provides for an option for class A licenses only. And that is restaurants. That allows for package sales of beer and wine only. And we have included, as you probably read the restrictions as no displays of package items for sale must be in conjunction with other services. So sale of food, other events, and most importantly, must still meet the holders of the option must still meet the primary purpose requirement of class A licensees, which is that the sale of food must be at least 50% of their revenue. So you may wonder, why are these restrictions here? And they're designed to ensure that sales a packaged liquor does not overtake the class A establishment and then effectively turn it into a liquor store while still trying to address business owners interest in the ability to expand their upper tree opportunities.

We did consider expanding to class b, which is taverns, but our concern was that it would, enforcement would be very difficult because of the difficulty in differentiating between package sales and pouring sales or, you know, on premises consumption. So we have restricted it. Just a class a. Now, as to the beer and own and wine only restriction that was designed, again, to ensure for businesses that their revenue would remain primarily from the sale of food or other sale of food is required by code. Now, Trimble funeral Home is expressed some concern in this regard that to limit sales of packaged goods to only bear in mind excluding spirits will restrict their ability to actually expand in a successful way and may be too limiting. We offer this for your consideration, discussion or habit, and answer questions. So certainly with the hat of liquor commissioner, I've been aware of the need expressed by that particular business. I would like to suggest to this council, since this ordinance has a few more readings, that we'd come up with a proper wording, but I'd be happy to know what your preference would be in their particular case. They would be interested in selling wine and spirits, and as far as I understand, they weren't. They haven't in the past done the beer sales right. So could an amendment to this ordinance say something like two of these three options? Would that be a way to control for the 50% income threshold that we're trying to do? Or. I mean, we would have to take that under advisement from you. Well, that is a somewhat complicated question. Certainly we can revise this in any way that council wishes. Our concern about expanding to any wine, spirits, beer, etcetera, is, again, that it would turn that establishment more into a liquor store than a restaurant. Now, we looked around. We could find only one other example. So we don't have a lot of data to share with you as to how this really works in the real life. We appreciate and drafting this, that it is a first draft, and we are certainly presenting this for your improvement or further discussion? Discussion. Yes. Mister Schmidt, motion. Oh, I'm so sorry. I should not have even spoken without the motion on the floor. I apologize. Clarification? I apologize. Motion to approve. Thank you. Mister Timmin. There's a second by Rosak. Mister Schmidt. Thank you, your honor. As in most things in class four like this, when we start restricting, I don't see a need to exclude spirits personally. I think because, and I think for that exact reason, if you're trying to do a tasting event to. To then exclude. To say you can't do it with a cocktail, but we're going to allow wine or beer, it just. It gets a little silly to my mind. That said, I do hear on the concerns of not wanting this to turn everyone into a liquor store. I hear that. But part of that is me wanting to ask and understand, because I think we've extensively reviewed that in the past, as how that works in the gaming sector. But as far as just related to the liquor license only, how does that play out as a process, if someone is accused of, or when it comes up for the annual check against where their revenue is coming from, and how that sort of plays out? Like, we walk through that a little. Sure. So, sales of liquor, their revenue is reported separate from sale of food. So, finance here at this city receives that information and records it, obviously for tax purposes. In the event that, like gaming that. Liquor sales for class A license. Thank you. Yes. Exceeds sales of food. So that, you know, again, your code requires that sell of food for class A licensees, which is a restaurant, is at least 50% of total sales. So should liquor exceed that of 50%, then that licensee runs the risk of losing their lace. Would that be triggered automatically or just come up during the. Operationally. Operationally. The liquor commissioner looks at it, we decide what path forward we need for remedying it. And that's communicated with them back and forth. And yeah, we licenses have been lost for failure to comply with varieties of pieces of the ordinance. But that's the operationally. I think what you were asking Mister Timmy, two questions. And we're using Trimble as an example, so I think that's a good one. First question is, is the alcohol reported separately for package sales or alcohol consumed on as a part of a meal? That's the first question. So, if it's consumed as part of a meal, is that lumped into alcohol sales, or is that lumped into food, food and restaurant? Second question. This being a funeral home that has an event space, it's very clear they're a funeral home. And is there funeral home revenue considered into this as well? Or is it just the event food? Because I could see a world where they have a couple bangers that have a lot of alcohol sales that exceed the appetizers they're serving, or small plates. And that jeopardizes the entire operation. Whereas their main revenue source is a funeral club. Two questions.

Because it wasn't something that I think I didn't come in tonight understanding the relevance of that conversation. And now it's definitely something I'd like to see a more. Okay. Okay. Motion to a motion to table. Second to when you can have a date. You can say indefinitely. You can. The next meeting is two weeks from now until next meeting. Okay, so there's a motion by Castro to table this item 910 until our next regular meeting, which is March May 7 2nd by Mister Schmidt. And there's no discussion about that, correct? We just do. Roll call on a table vote. Miss Gestapolis is roll call on a table vote? Yes. All right. Roll call, please. Older person. Macias? Aye. Razak? Aye. Timian? Nay. Finch? Aye. McNeil. Aye. Castro? Aye. Schmidt? Murphy? Aye. All right, that motion to table passes by a vote of $7.01. Seven eyes, one nay. That's what I should have said. Okay, thank you very much. So, we are now to resolution 9.11. Resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an administrative order on consent under section 309 A of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1319 A, with the United States Environmental Protection Agency relating to compliance with the Clean Water act and its industrial pre treatment requirements. And authorizing the director of utilities to execute any and all necessary documents related to this work. Mister Lode, would you care to elaborate on your two year project? Actually, this dates back to 2021. And we've attempted to keep you updated on this topic through status and information report updates. However, our over a year long back and forth with us, EPA hit a roadblock but I'll summarize. The Clean Water act requires owners of publicly operated treatment works, such as those that we operate here in Moline, to have an industrial pre treatment program. These treatment works aren't designed to treat industrial waste, and there's a concern that those discharges might interfere with or adversely impact the treatment works. So us EPA conducted an audit, a desktop audit, of Moline's pre treatment operations in 2021. And the result is this. We consulted with Margaret and we consulted with the engineer that's been helping us navigate this, and we've come to the conclusion that the cost to continue fighting with EPA on this is not worth the benefit. The cost to continue fighting is not over. It outweighs the work that we'd have to do to come into compliance. And so the resulting order would require us to do some additional testing for ethyl benzene, toluene, xylene and some toxic organics at one of our industrial dischargers. And I'll have you know that while we do recommend approving this or executing this, and it also is going to appear on the non consent agenda of the council meeting, in no way was the discharge at this industrial discharger adversely impacting our treatment works, or was there ever a point when the treatment works was out of compliance. Thank you very much. Motion. Motion to oppose. Motion by Finn, seconded by Castro. Discussion hearing? None. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? That motion passes. So we are to our informational Mister Vitas, the 2024 to 26 strategic plan dashboard for quarter one. Thank you, mayor and council. But before I move on to that item, I would be remiss not going back to item nine six for the moment, and thanking very specifically, Chris Matthias, for all his hard work and what we did on the JC Penney project with Renew Moline, and the diligence in his department in pursuing this through some tumultuous discussions. Thank you, Chris, for the job well done in CED and your team in particular. All right, with that, very quickly. As you know, the report in front of you is basically the first quarterly report. We have 42. We have 47 goals in our strategic plan. There are 42 that today are on track. There are two goals that were previously completed, one that was completed a little earlier, but is included here as well. We do have one project that is on hold, and that actually is the rewriting of the municipal code that was placed on hold temporarily. So, that being said, if there's questions, I'm more than happy to answer them. I just. I think the tool is working. I hope it's working for you. I know. The citizens, you know, probably do enjoy it.

Motion to advance the second reading. Second motion by Timmy and seconded by Macias. Discussion. Mister Matthias, were you. You can do something. Go ahead, David, if you could put up those. Thank you. He's got me all set up. Appreciate that. So we just wanted to have four minutes here to talk about really quick the staff recommendation on this before I get started. I really appreciate the plant commission and the number of meetings they put into this since your directive back in December. I want to thank my staff for the long hours they put in, as well as we've really. I feel, you know, not everybody in the planning commission agrees about this, but certainly there's been good consensus building, and I feel like they've had a good, healthy discussion on this matter. What is an accessory dwelling unit? And this is the opportunity to explain to you what's in this ordinance, because you're going to hear from different people about what might or may not be in it. This is what's proposed to you right now. But an accessory dwelling unit is a residential dwelling unit. It's located on the same lot of record as a one family detached dwelling. That should say just a single family home is another way to say that accessory dwelling unit should be one of four types. So it can be attached, could be a coach house, which is a unit that's above a garage. It could be a detached unit, which would be similar to, like a detached garage in your backyard. But as we've discussed before, probably going to be difficult to take a detached garage built on a slab and just turn it into an ADU. But that is one option here is that it would be a separate unit entirely from the single family home and could also be interior to the house. So that would be a unit that's entirely inside the existing single family home. These are some real life examples out there. City of Albany, California was one of the examples. Buildingandu.com is where I got one and I really like the top right. It reminded me of a. It reminds me of a mollet home. And so that idea of like, thinking about these on these mollet lots and being able to fit those in. Why do cities need adus? There's a lack of affordable housing right now. We all know that housing prices have skyrocketed over the last few years. That was happening before COVID and it's been exacerbated. You're going to continue to see my staff at least trying to push more housing types around the city. This is just one of those. It's not going to be the solution to the housing crisis. It's just going to be one of those drops in the bucket of how we try to attack this problem. But you'll certainly see us pushing different housing types and that missing middle all over the city, because that's really where it should be. New housing starts in mulling have been down for several decades. Adus offer the option for senior citizens to age in place or stay in close proximity to family. And then finally they do promote more dense development, contrary to urban spray. As far as what's in this ordinance, like I said, we have the definition of an ADU. Those four types, only one would be allowed per r two zoned lot in the city, and it'll be subject to other regulations that may or may not prevent it from going in there at all, which we'll talk about in a second. There's an owner occupied requirement, so the property owner must permanently reside in either the single family home or in the ADU cannot be used as a short term rental.

There's an owner occupied requirement, so the property owner must permanently reside in either the single family home or in the ADU cannot be used as a short term rental. Our chapter eight in the new rental housing code defines that as a vacation rental unit. So if it basically, we're saying ADU has to rent for at least 30 days, they should have their own separate entrance regardless of the ADU type. With this current proposed ordinance, there's no requirement for additional parking for the ADU. But if the property owner is going to convert an existing garage to the ADU, they would have to replace that parking that was required for the single family home, which in our code right now is three spaces. ADU shall not have a separate driveway or curb cut. They shall be incidental to the single family home where they've got to match it either with architectural style, exterior materials, colors. And then as far as some of those things that would pre include an ADU, anything that's not interior to you. The minimum lot size is 6500 sqft. So that lot would have to be at least 6500 sqft. We have a lot coverage requirement of 35%, so they can't exceed 35%. Lot coverage on an r two lot. That's not in this ordinance. That's just in our actual code. In our zoning code, there's a livable space limitation of 1000 sqft for an ADU. That would be a very large ADU, but we didn't want to put some kind of limit on the size. And these are the setbacks that would be for detached and coach house adus, those that are basically separate from the home. There'd be a five foot side setback with a total of twelve. If you add up both side setbacks, that matches our existing principal side setbacks for a principal structure, but there would also be a ten foot rear setback. So right now you could do a garage like 5ft off the rear property line. We're adding some additional setback for a detached ADU of 10ft, 10ft total. And then an attached ADU would have to meet the requirements. Just like you're attaching to a house. Right. Other than the only thing that's different to this is both the detached adus and attached adus are not allowed on the front of the house. They've either got to be in the side yard or the rear yard. And that would be the same with the attached ADU. So staff recommendation on this to plan commission was to approve the plan. Commission voted seven 70 to recommend approval of that attached text amendment that's attached to the council bill. The plan commission motion also included staff's memo in response to the review criteria in our chapter 35 of the mulling code as the findings of fact. And I do want to point out also David Silverman's help on this. He's helped us review the ordinance and appreciate his insight as well. Any questions for me, Mister Schmidt? I had a couple of. In the. In the weed you get two council item. Your honor, make a motion to allow for additional questions on this issue. Is there a second 2nd? 2nd by Alderperson Castro? Yes, this is the proper procedure, correct? Yes. Do I need to do a roll call? Yeah, roll call, please. Can you tell me who the second was on there? It was Castro. And the motion is to allow for additional questions. Alderperson? Macias? Aye. Razak? Timian? Aye. Finch? McNeil? Aye. Castro? Schmidt? Aye. Murphy? Aye. All right, that motion passes. You get more than two as we're looking at, like, a detached dwelling unit or coach house. Any of them that have the height restrictions in place when that. Would that height restriction apply to the true height of the buildings or to the height height of where they land on the lot or both? So, thinking if the. It's either up or down the hill. Yeah. So we determine an average grade of a lot, basically, where we determine the height of buildings. The ADU is not going to be able to be taller than the principal, than the house either way. However, we determine that. So we'll come up with an average grade. The adu's got to be. It's an accessory dwelling unit, right? It's got to be. It can't be as tall or as big, if that makes sense. Or. Excuse me. It can't be bigger or taller. But if the lot is on the hill and ADU is higher, though, is it based on the actual height of the building? I understand what you're saying.

I guess my first question is, a while back, we had made. We had voted on that housing study to kind of, like, see what kind of housing that we have in Moline and what people are needing. Is there a reason that we're not waiting until after we get the results of those surveys to move on this? So are you talking about the ones we do for the Hud grants that we do in five years? Yeah. You know, those were coming back ten to 15 years ago with the findings that we had too much single family in the city of Moline. My guess is they'll be saying, and that's ComInG out of the impediments of fair housing. The housing study is more data, in my opinion. So it'll show you a lot of data about some of the housing maybe, that we're missing.

So it'll show you a lot of data about some of the housing maybe, that we're missing. But those findings, even going back to the mid two thousands, I think we're saying, hey, look, you have too much single family in this town, and it could be excluding people. Okay? And then I just one other question is there, I think previously there had been SOmetHIng in there about the maximum occupancy. Is there. Is that gone from the ordinance or is that still in there? I thought before it said that there was like a maximum of like five people, it would be the definition of a family, which we still have in our code and we. We didn't change along with this ordinance. Okay. All right. Thank you, Mister Timian. Point. There is a restriction of one living quarter per ADU, which means you can't have an ADU that's a duplex. And so that is in there. Or it was the last time I looked at it. I had a question in a loophole that I might have thought of at the last minute. My neighbor has a double lot. Can they build an Adu on the second lot and one on their primary because it says zoning lot and I'm just curious how that works. Yeah, I mean, there's a couple things that would come into play, right? I mean, if they. If you have a. If you have a lot that's big enough and you want to split that off, or it's already split off, maybe it's just combined for tax purposes. Right. And there really are two lots there. You can use that lot for a house. And if it's a big enough, if it's 6500, it meets all the lot coverage, then you could also do an ADU there. But that would be similar to any two lot. You could have two lots in the city of Maine that have a house and then have Adus, which would be the same in my mind. Or you could just split it and do it anyway. Except you couldn't reside in your own, correct? Yeah, it wouldn't comply. Yes. You had another question, Mister Schmidt? Yes. When converting an existing detach or attached garage, the required parking for the principal structure must be replaced on site. So my question is the requirement of three parking spaces. If. Would they simply have to comply or would they have to add additional meaning? If I already have four concrete spots, four qualifying concrete spots, plus two inside a garage, would I then still comply without adding a distribution parking? I would have to be able to because there's not going to be any required parking for the ADU. Right. So you just have to show me where you have those three parking spots on your lot somewhere, is what I would say. Because in this, what we're talking about is we've removed a garage, right. That in theory have that required parking. The driveway could still be that. You could have a parking pad somewhere as long as it complies with our zoning code. What you can't do is just pour a parking pad right off the road or something, right? Because that wouldn't, you know, we need to have curb cuts and things like that. So any other questions? Mister Schmidt? Yeah, I did want to state that I think that as we. Well, first, specifically on that garage parking piece. I know that was an issue that had come up the last time. I think this. That's a much better way to deal with it than what we had seen previously. So thank you for that. I'm very excited to see this moving through. I think it's been a very long conversation with many, many meetings that have taken place as we look through here. I have heard much more support for Adus coming from people I've spoken to in the community than opposition. But when I've heard opposition, a lot of it has been about worry and concerns. I think that the biggest thing we have that we've kept here that helps address a lot of those concerns is that we are requiring that owner occupancy piece. And I think knowing that one of our biggest problems with our residential housing stock is rollover to these large landlord companies as opposed to kind of maintaining local ownership, I just. I really appreciate that piece. I think that's going to address most of the biggest concerns we've heard from the community. And I really think this is going to just be a very good thing overall. In some ways, we're going back in time. Right? It's like my grandfather's house. He had this like kitchen upstairs. And I always wonder, why is this kitchen up here? Why is this. Right? And that's like, in some ways we're going back to how it used to be. I feel like, you know, 70 years ago with development types. Thank you. Anything further from the council, Mister Timmy? Just want to thank staff and the plan commission for this. It was a long drawn out process, which is good governance. There was a lot of discussion. There are a lot of concerns. I know that Miss Moore left, but she mentioned barbershops and accountants in the neighborhood. These are not commercial lots, so you can't do that. Oh, you're talking. We can. So here's where we have this discussion at plan commission. And my personal feeling is like, why, if there's something that's allowed in a home right now, why couldn't I do that in Adu?

And what's allowed in a home right now is called a minor home occupation. Music lessons, a home office. Things that generally don't trigger a lot of people showing up and. Right. So we also have a major home occupation, which is something you go apply for a special use when you want to do an in home barbershop or things like that. So it wouldn't allow those unless they went and got a special use. And so at that point, the plan commission could weigh in and say, this adu does not work for a in home barbershop, if that's what they wanted to say. Well, with that being said, our neighborhoods are already set up that way. My neighborhood has plenty of shells of businesses that have been converted to residential. So this is how the city was built to allow for businesses in residential, and we're talking about minor businesses. So this isn't, it shouldn't be a major inconvenience, in my opinion. So I'm excited and happy that this is here today, and I just want to thank everyone involved. Mister Macy's. Thank you, your honor. And, you know, you go down 16th street, you see it all over. So it's already happening. So there's another opportunity to people do it a little differently. Why not? So it's just my take on it. Thank you. Anything further, Mister Macy? I mean, Matthias. Thank you. All right, if there's nothing further from the council, roll call, please. Elder person. Macias, aye. Aye. Timian? Aye. Finch? Aye. McNeil? Aye. Castro? Nay. Schmidt? Aye. Murphy? Nay. So that's six. I's two a six. All right. Thank you very much. Finished with all those items, we move to miscellaneous business. I'm pleased to report that today at the transportation committee meeting for bi state, which I represent the city on, we were informed. I didn't even get to tell anybody this yet. And Mister Dreyer, if he's online, we'll be happy to know that they voted to approve the TASA funds for phase two of the Morgan park multimodal. If I'm saying that right, pathway in the 2016 budget. So I didn't get to follow up and wonder, like, really, is it really going to take that long to move through these phases? So. But they approved it at 80%. So we were the only Illinois city out of the two that applied for those funds to get those funds. So, first ward meeting, when you had a resident who said, so we're going to build this thing, we're going to pay this money. Actually, we're getting it. I believe that's federal dollars. They are federal dollars. Okay. Predominantly. All right. Also, I was going to look it up here for you. Ro from MCD, see, is looking for volunteers for planting trees. They got a grant, I believe. Where is it? I will forward it to you. But MCDC got a whole bunch of trees and is looking for volunteers. So that's a wonderful way to find your constituents and work on a project together, I think, and I've been having good conversations with visit Quad cities about the return on investment that they bring. You'll see some things coming forward on the May 7 agenda related to the that. And these are long standing conversations about how they're funded, how what we get back from supporting that work and not having to do that work ourselves. So look forward to that. That's all, Miss Murphy. I don't have any questions. Mister Macias. Thank you, your honor. Just on May 14, I'll be having my second word meeting at the Mercado building from six to seven. So you'll be seeing more of that being promoted out there. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mister Timmy. Thank you, your honor. May 28 is the fourth ward meeting. We hope to eclipse the attendance of wars one and two. It is now a contest. I know. And ultimately Alderberg and Schmidt wins because he gets to collect them all. I wanted to mention that Alderberg person, Macias and I, along with administrator Vitas and Alex from Renu, and other staff members who have been part of this task force for the downtown redevelopment project. And we saw a new concept yesterday that the longer I've sat on it, the more excited I am about the direction that this is going, including east of the bridge. So things are looking really good. I think there's room for finessing, and we were sent a link to share this, so I'm happy to share it with any members of council or public that request it. So reach out, and I know there's some confidential stuff in there, so we'll just make sure. And May 11. May 11. Oh, correct. May 11 is the next meeting at Mercado building for community feedback on the riverfront. That's replane, correct? Yeah. So we'll. You'll. That'll be a public view of everything, but it is really, really. It's taking shape, and I think it's great. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Finch, Mister McDonald's. Nothing. Your honor. Mister Schmidt, Mister Vitas. I'm good. We had a great first ward meeting, though, so good luck meeting Debbie numbers. Yeah, that was pretty good. What did you do?

And on behalf of local 581, I'd just like to invite each of you to attend. This Sunday. Starts at 730. Thank you. Oh, yes. While the weather is warming up, you'll probably start to see a lot more walkers out in your wards, and that will also probably generate some traffic into the alderman. So I just wanted to let you know, if you're not familiar, if you do get speeding complaints or traffic complaints, if you could send those to me, we'll look into them. But one of the things we would start with is a speed survey. By setting up speed signs to gather data on the speeds and the volume of the traffic. A lot of times you'll find, particularly in some of the neighborhoods that are sidewalk back to curb people's opinion of traffic, is that it's actually going faster than the data shows. So send those to me. We'll get our traffic unit to look into those. They work with our traffic committee, which is comprised of the police department, public works, and traffic engineers to then put their heads together on potential solutions. So I just wanted to remind you that because I'm sure as the weather warms up, you'll start to get. Get more of those in your works. Thank you. Thank you. Any other staff carrying? None.

We move on to a proclamation from Nawic, Quad Cities chapter number 50, to declare the week of March 30 through 9th, 2024. As women in construction week. Would you like to speak first? Our guests, kelly Porum from Kone and Sarah Cole Breese from Estes Construction. Do I speak into this thing? Yes, please. All right. On behalf of the Quad Cities chapter 50, I would like to thank the City of Moline, the mayor and the city council members for the proclamation of our 2024 Women in Construction Week. NAWIC's mission is to enhance the success of the women in the construction industry. We provide awareness of the opportunities available for women and emphasize the growing role of women in the construction industry. Wicweek is a time for local chapters to give back to their communities. Chapter 50 does so during their year through its scholarship program and by partnering with local agencies such as the Quad City Engineering and Science Council, the Girl Scouts of eastern Iowa and western Illinois, Argro's house and Winnie's place. This year we will be supporting the humility homes and services. We will be collecting daily necessity items to be donated to HHS during their presentation at our hard Hat Happy hour on Thursday, March 7. Thank you again for your support. Thank you so much for sharing all that. And the proclamation reads, whereas nawic. Do you prefer that to be nawic? Got it. Quad Cities chapter number 50 has distinguished itself for 61 years as the voice of women in construction in the Quad City area. And whereas the work done by Nowwick Quad Cities chapter number 50 has benefited Moline, Illinois, through community development and educational programs, and whereas Nowick Quad Cities chapter number 50 has unceasingly promoted the employment and advancement of women in the construction industry, and whereas the construction community represented by Nahuat Quad Cities chapter number 50 has been a driving force in fostering community development through renovation and beautification projects, promotion of skilled trades careers, and a positive vision of the future. Now, therefore, I, Sangeetha Rayapatti, mayor of Moline, do hereby recognize now at Quad Cities chapter number 50 and its many dedicated volunteers for its steadfast work on behalf and in support of women in construction. And do proudly proclaim the week of March 3 through 920 24 as women in construction week. Thank you so much. Thank you. All right, and now we move to public comment. I'm actually going to make public comment this evening. It's very fitting that we were celebrating contributions of women today as we also celebrate the recognition of a Moline high school senior, Mariam Nidai, and her coach, Jacob Rudiger. We're extremely proud of your accomplishment this weekend in being a state champion at the Illinois High School association girls wrestling state championship. And I want to tell you as well that back on January 21 of 2022, I wrote a note to the Moline school board and district administrators urging them to add girls wrestling as a sport at the high school.

Pleasure to meet you. I know your counterpart, Jim. Well, anyhow, while we have spent the last several years wrestling with Jim, not getting a state championship, Jim proved to be one hell of a wrestler, and a good one at that. But he didn't take us to the Met, and we didn't take him to the mat. We actually met, shook hands, and we have what I consider to be a really great deal for the city going forward. First of all, thanks to par instrument for their willingness to stay here in Moline. And not be taken across the river, or elsewhere, for that matter. Here on the Illinois side of the river, you had many choices, and you chose to stay place in Moline with your 125 year history, which I think speaks well for the city. As you know, the project itself, there's a number of items that will appear on the agenda this evening, and then they'll appear for the final time on the 12 March for final approval, at which point it's all guns blasting. It's time to go. All right. It's time to get Russell doing their thing. But the project itself, at 211 53rd street, which is their current headquarters and where their manufacturing facilities are located, is a $22.7 million project, which includes a 54,000 square foot manufacturing edition. And that's phase one. I know there's a second phase. We talked about that two years ago. And I expect with the growth the companies receiving and experiencing now, that addition will probably happen during the near term as opposed to long from now. And then the renovation of their current facility that they've operated in forever. Now, the 44,000 square foot building. So it's a new addition, it's a new home, and it is what I would consider. It's the inaugural project inside the TIF that we created, and hopefully it serves as that domino that we expect it will be to create other development within the TIF. So I could belabor everything here, but I want to thank David for all his work on this. I want to thank your attorneys as well, for working with David. That's not always an easy thing. He's a good negotiator. I want to thank Chris for his efforts and kind of mentoring this through. And I don't want to forget about Tony Lode, because Tony Lode was the person who introduced me to the gym in the first place two and a half years ago to actually begin this dialogue. So it takes a long time to work out a good deal. Sometimes they come quick, but the good deals come hard. And this was a project that the city really needed to see happen in Moline. So with that, I'm going to recommend approval not only on this item, but the next several items as well as they come up. Motion to approve. 2nd. 2nd all right. Motion by schmidt, seconded by Macias. Discussion. Mister Schmidt, I just want to say that I'm very pleased to see this moving forward, very happy with kind of, as we see the terms of the deal, as those pieces go, I know this has been a project that was kind of was already on the wish list. Around the talking block when we came onto council. I'm really glad in the last year or two we've been able to finally get that moving. I think it's gonna be great for the community and hopefully good for par. So that's just very excited to see it moving. Anything else from council? I just wanna put the bug in our brains is that I'm very happy for this. Absolutely. And as we bring on an economic development manager and we think about what else can happen in that TiF. Right. We wanna always make sure we're not just letting it be the only project. We have to still work hard to get other things to happen down there. So thank you so much. If there's nothing further. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? That motion passes 7.2. An ordinance approving the vacation and conveyance of title to certain public rights of way, a public alley in block four in C. G. Toulin's second addition to East Moline and portions of right of way of Second Avenue and 52nd street. Anything further, Mister Vitas?

A one and two protecting buildings par instrument development. Strippy task. Again, an essential part of the development of this project. One is the planned unit development, which gave us the ability to work directly with PAr to maximize the benefit of the utility of both properties outside of standard zoning, and then the flood hazard prevention variance. So it allows them to go forward with the. I guess it's the elevation of the building and maybe, Chris, you want to talk about that too? Because the flood issue is the most critical issue to our instrument. Right. So just to be clear, all of the new, everything new that's being built there is going to be 2ft above the base flood elevation, which is actually 1ft above our standard. The variance is simply for the existing building. We have some requirements in our code that that existing building would also have to be raised up or flood proof, and so the project simply wouldn't be possible for Parr to stay on site unless we were to bury that. So that's included in the pud ordinance before you. Thank you so much. Next motion to approve. Second. That was by older person Finch, seconded by Razak. Any discussion hearing? None. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? That motion passes 7.5, an ordinance approving the 2024 amendment to the Moline center redevelopment project area TIF number 13, and adopting the 2024 amendment to the Moline center redevelopment project area TIF number 13. So, procedurally, what we need to do going forward is as the JC Penney property and parts of Fifth Avenue are already a part of an existing TIF. TIF number 13, which is. Was created back, I believe, in 2016, if I'm not mistaken. So it's not a very old TIF, but it's old enough that it has enough years that it have elapsed that TIF 15 became necessary in order to make the JC Penney residential redevelopment project work financially on paper. So what we're doing is removing from TIF 13 those properties which are also a part of the TIF 15 that will be approved, approved afterwards. So this is a necessary step in order to create TIV 15 at a subsequent meeting. Motion to approve. Second motion by Finch. Seconded by Castro. Discussion. Mister Tamian. Bob, I'm just. This is maybe for David, too. When we shrink a TIF that already has a line of credit out against it, we barred against it. Does that impact that agreement at all, or. The terms have kind of changed, and I'm just kind of curious if this is something that anyone's ever encountered or. No, I mean, when Tiff. When TIFF 13 was created, it was kind of carved out. You have to realize we had TifF one, which was this massive tiff that covered the entire downtown from one end to the other. And then out of TIFF 13, they began to recognize that certain projects couldn't be done with the remaining life of the TiF. So they started to carve out different parts of the Tiff in order to create it. So TIFF 13 is just that. It looks like a key up the middle of Fifth to avenue. It's the best way to describe it. Kind of a jagged cape. Certain properties were included in it that had growth potential. Other properties were left out. The base AEAV, when that TIfF was assumed established back in 2016, includes the properties that we are carving out of it. So, in essence, by removing those properties, we are changing the formula within that TIF, which you probably know, and we're lowering that EAV based on those values. And ultimately, does it impact it adversely? We have not seen an adverse impact. We haven't seen a lot of growth in TIFF 13, actually. So whether it remains the way it is today, or whether it gets shrunk even more, is to be seen as projects. The exercise that we did take was to verify that we weren't severing TIFF 13 into two parts before touching anymore, ensuring that it does stay intact. In fact, really, the only thing, when you look at what's coming out of TIFF 13, it's basically all of TIFF 15, except for the dispatch building and the alley. Correct. Thank you. It's not that bad of anything. Any further questions? Hearing? None. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? That motion passes 7.6.

Chief, if you want to add anything to it, by all means, please come to the mic. No, I think you covered it. The technology is from a different company, but the cameras are the same platform that we have existing. It's Motorola vigilante cameras on the top of the extended mast, so they will integrate with the existing video management system that we already have. There's no additional cost for that. We'll just bring it on board similar to our mobile trailer that we already have for community engagement, that has cameras on it. And then that will still live under the same policies that we have for access and constitutional policing and things like that. And then yes, we'd be able to move it around. It's solar powered as well as a gas backup generator, so primarily use solar. But if the, you know, if it's bad weather and you don't have solar activity, it'll kick into the generator. So it should be able to be deployed out there. But it's a great way to do something with our partners in the sheriff's department and be able to collaborate on various things. So we could use it as all the things that Bob said. But you know, as you know, over the last couple of years, we have a fixed amount of fiber. And so rather than building out more fiber, this is a pretty good way for us to move it around to the ever busy city that we have here. Thank you, chief. And thank you for the cost sharing. I mean, really, that helps with our balance that I talked so much about yesterday. Mister Schmidt. Chief, what are some examples of where and when it would be deployed? Yeah, well, I think the one good example is when we had Mo live that was moved down either on River Drive. We only had one camera at River 15, which is currently not working, but that one right there. And then we moved it over into the parking lot. We didn't have any video available there. Or for other areas that might have been a concern. Variety, use your imagination on a crime spree of a construction site getting burglarized. That we could put that and monitor a construction site for copper theft or different things like that. So there's a variety of different uses for it, but it's going to only be used for, if you read the agreement, street, streets and sidewalks, public space, or if it's on private property. We get consent from that private property owner to mitigate criminal activity, Mister Schmidt. And I appreciate the multiple pieces. Like you said going in. If you're going at a commercial site, that makes a lot of sense too. Like how big does an event have to be for us to be popping up the camera there? Mo Live is an example, but that is the biggest we're going to have. And we have obviously a lot more smaller or medium sized. I'm just curious. Well, I don't know that I don't have a great answer for you there. I think a lot of those things we do is a risk evaluation for everything. So there may be a parking lot that we're having troubles in and it's just a simple quadsy storm game, but we've had maybe burglaries in a parking lot that we can't get video into and pop it in the alley and try to provide some better coverage there. I certainly think there's a balance there. Not to steal the mayor's thunder, but I think there's a balance like we don't need, probably need it at every event. And of course the sheriff's department is going to want to deploy it for their things in Port Byron or where else in the county. So it's not going to be available to us every day. But I think we do a lot of this even with off duty police presence of the risk evaluation and one of the risk evaluations. Maybe this event maybe doesn't need a physical police officer, but we could maybe drop a camera in the parking lot. That's helpful. Thank you. Mister Tomian. Just from a tech point of view, is the video uploading wirelessly in real time or is it stored on the device and we take it off the bat? It's stored in the unit itself, so the appliance is inside there. So basically a peak system in to view it. And then if we need to download, clips would download, but it would have the same retention policy that we already have. It's a cellular, there's a cellular chip in it just like your phones that would transmit the data. But rather than the broadband dump of it constantly streaming, it's basically a peak system. Mister Macias. Thank you. And if say there's two events you mentioned say poor Byron and one here, do they just decide? Well, they have first preference or we're gonna wrestle and we're gonna. So in the agreement, we have set out some priorities for it because that was the other thing is I would assume this piece of equipment is very well built. It's probably gonna outlast both the sheriff and in my career, I would hope. And so we did put in some priorities there. Just some common sense approach there. If there's two burglary sites, we'll try have to work through it as colleagues and say, hey, can you use it for these two days? We'll use it for these two days. We're going to establish a calendar for it so we know where it's at.

Mister Macias. Thank you. And if say there's two events you mentioned say poor Byron and one here, do they just decide? Well, they have first preference or we're gonna wrestle and we're gonna. So in the agreement, we have set out some priorities for it because that was the other thing is I would assume this piece of equipment is very well built. It's probably gonna outlast both the sheriff and in my career, I would hope. And so we did put in some priorities there. Just some common sense approach there. If there's two burglary sites, we'll try have to work through it as colleagues and say, hey, can you use it for these two days? We'll use it for these two days. We're going to establish a calendar for it so we know where it's at. Once deployed, who's responsible for it. But if there's a big event, tug fest would take priority over it just sits sitting in a parking lot here monitoring general parking lot safety. Does that answer your question? Anything further from the council? Thank you so much. Hearing none. All in favor? Any opposed? That motion passes.

I will just add to this by saying we're recommending approval submit the grant based on Eric's presentation, the prior meeting, as well as the upcoming item in terms of an amendment to the ordinance. So we're going to recommend approval on both items seven, seven and 7.9 going forward. Thank you very much. Is there a motion? Motion to approve, second motion by Finch. Seconded by Castro. Discussion. Once again, thank you for trying to go after grant dollars. All right, if there's nothing further. All in favor? Any opposed?

And I'm happy that you're having meetings to make sure that that happens by July. And lastly, when it comes to this grocery tax, I don't know how many people watched anything related to the governor's state of the state or budget address his budget plans. But we did get some communication from IML about the grocery tax repeal and its impact on us. And so I turned around and asked Lori Uloa for what that impact would be to us. And I believe the information was, we can't calculate it yet, that she got from the people she had to ask. Correct? The way the Illinois state tax is structured and collected, those taxes are applied differently on different items. So in order to break out specifically, specifically, what this grocery tax is applied to as a part of the overall tax is not something anybody thought of reporting out separately. So Illinois Department of Revenue is being challenged to probably provide that information, not just to us, but to probably everyone, because, you know, budgets have been long adopted and people have moved forward, and now at this late hour, the governor wants to give back whatever he wants to give back. I think it's 1% is what it is. Of the gross of the total sales, state sales tax. So we continue to wait for a response from the Illinois Department of Revenue. And I don't believe, and I know Lori's online. I don't know, maybe she knows whether we've heard anything back, but I haven't seen anything. Laurie, do you care to comment on this at all? I have not heard back from the state of Illinois. I'm trying to contact a couple of the other cities that are close to our size who actually provided an estimate in that email, but I have not heard back from them yet. So I'll try again tomorrow and see if I can figure out how they calculated it and try to do a very rough estimate on that. Thank you. So I'll let you know as soon as I can. Yeah. Thank you so much. And just for the council's knowledge, I believe the difference between when this was enacted before and now is that the legislature crafted something in the budget that replaced those funds for municipalities. And this time there's nothing in there to replace it for us. So we would be out some money so that we're just trying to get a handle on what the impact would be. All right. And that is all I have. Miss Murphy? I have nothing. Your Honor. Yes. Thank you. Yeah, just wanted to thank everybody for the support with the community id. You know, years ago, I remember thinking, you know, why doesn't Moline or the Quad Cities have such a thing? And it wasn't until a couple years ago that I was talking to a friend, Myra Hernandez, and she talked about doing something here in the Quad cities, such as a community id. And I was in this position and I figured, you know what? Why don't we get something going? We had our challenges. We were thinking bigger with the counties, but it really was a blessing because we got it done here in Moline first. This community id is going to help a lot of different people. It's going to help young people, people who are transitioning, people who might live on the streets, and just anybody who wants to have a secondary id. And in addition, there will be an element that's going to have an economic impact that can help some small businesses. So now the work really begins. So I do have a meeting lined up with Bob on Thursday and, but I'm really looking forward to looking back years from now saying Moline did it first. So thank you, everybody, for supporting this. Mister Rezaq, I am thanking Marcia for coming up with this unique idea. This will enormously help our community once again. Thank you so Tameen nothing. Your Honor attended the good gathering Sunday, learned a lot about parent mentor program that is run through Western Illinois University, partnering with school districts including Moline school district. So parents in the classroom immersed in teaching and learning. And what's really neat is creating opportunities. A lot of the parents in the program are going on to finish their education, whether that's their high school diploma or GED or get their bachelor's in education. So, yeah, it was nice program and really well attended. Yeah. So we'll be following up on that strategic goal. I think it's 2.5. You have it memorized? I have it memorized. I have pictures of all of my ideas on my board in there. But what I mentioned yesterday, the formalizing of good gatherings, is using the vital conditions framework, which talks about belonging and civic muscle as one of the vital conditions we need for a thriving community. And as you can tell from my speech yesterday, that is the goal is I think we could have another session. Our next strategic planning session can be about how we become a thriving community. Right. Not just surviving. And I really like this framework, so I'll share it with you. But that's kind of how I would like to share with you how we can weave that objective 2.5 into our larger strategic plan and how it rolls out in programming.

After 17 months, people starting to reach to us to share what they're doing for the community. That's great, Miss Castro. Thank you. Yes, I last week attended the scam seminar that was hosted by the human Rights Commission. They had a really great turnout. Thank you to Dave Rowett and to a couple members of the police department that were there. I think that there were over 30, 30 folks that showed up, and they learned a lot. I think that I even learned a couple of things, too. So great turnout. Thank you for that. And then not as great of a turnout at my board meeting last night, but I wanted to thank staff and mayor for attending. There was a woman who lived on 47th street and 26th Avenue who had David Dreier all to herself to talk about the construction. So I'm sure she very much appreciated it. So thank you. I had the opportunity this past weekend to attend the Pokemon Day at the library along with my kids. And it was a good reminder of not just that event, but all the wonderful events at the library. I don't imagine at that age I'd have gotten away with yelling as much as they do in the library now, but I think they keep upstairs still quiet. And there are so many different programs, whether it's those for the kids and those offered for seniors and for other further development. And I just have heard a lot of good stories about that and people using those programs. And I just wanted to recognize that and call that out because I think it continues to be one of the great things about our city. And so glad we continue to support the library and that council has made that a priority. So looking forward to hearing more of the good things going forward. Thank you. On that note, do you have the date? Isn't there a fundraiser at Ford Bros. Oh, yes. Do you mind sharing that with us? Yes. We do have a fundraising event coming up next Wednesday, March 6. It's going to be at for Rose Craft Tavern right down the road here. That day, 10% of all of their sales are going to go directly to the library gardens project. So we have. We'll have that evening between five and 08:00 we'll have. We have some silent auction items and some raffle items there that were donated by local businesses in the community. So, yeah, we hope to have a great attendance that night. And we would love it if you could attend as well or help us spread the word. Thank you so much, Mister Lear, Mister Vitas, anything for miscellaneous. I always have things for miscellaneous, but I'm looking at that clock and saying we're gonna get out early. I can't believe this. Real quick. I'm looking forward to next month. Make sure Jim is here when we do the final approval. Absolutely. Otherwise, we will take him to the mat. JC Penney will be back here first next month. Just so you know, we've been negotiating hard and fast, and those are proven to be great negotiations. So we'll be back with that next month again. The riverfront master redevelopment plan building off of that. You know, if you've given your input, great. If you haven't, make sure you get it in there. You know, it may be done in July, but it's going to be done a lot sooner than July than you think, because the entire team that's sitting in the wings waiting to actually get their hands on what becomes the final plan are going to use that to finish up all of their work. So I expect, Chris, that will probably, what? In about 45 days at the most, we'll be settling in on a plan. This is the. I would say this is the. This is the opportunity right now for that public input. There's never been a better time than that. Right. And then we don't mention the high school because we talked a lot about getting more input from the high schools. Yeah. So I'll be. I'll be attending a student council presentation tomorrow with. With Doctor Savage. So they've already pushed the plan out to all the high school students with the survey. But it's just an opportunity for us to kind of present it to the high school students too, and tell them why we're doing this. That's great. I love that. That's really, really great. We'll get a lot of input from our community's youth, which I think is great. And that's all I have tonight. Thank you. Any other staff? All right, we have no executive session, so I need a motion to adjourn. Motion to adjourn. All right. Motion by Castro, second by Finch. All in favor? Any opposed? All right, we're adjourned.", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Lutheran Social Services", "insights": [{"observation": "Lutheran social Services, who just moved to Moline, and they want to talk about foster families and being a foster parent.

This committee of the whole meeting to order here in council chambers at 06:00 p.m. mister Schmidt is joining us just a few minutes late, and Mister McNeil will not be with us this evening. So we do have a forum, but there's no remote electronic attendance, so we'll start with our oaths of office. Chief thank you very much, mayor. These are always really fun times as the police chief, to recognize the hard work of fellow officers in the Millennium Police Department and tell you how proud you should be of the men and women that work at the Millennium Police Department. I know I am, and this is a great opportunity to make a couple of promotions, so I appreciate the time today. First up, I'd like to introduce you to Andrew Ross Raya. He is a seasoned law enforcement professional with a distinguished career spanning 15 years. He's a proud native of Moline, graduated Moline High School and pursued higher education at Western Illinois University right here at our Quad Cities campus where he earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. Andrew is a first generation Mexican American with proud immigrant parents who came to Moline for a better life for their family and their children. Andrew certainly has made them proud of their decision to move here to Moline. Andrew is fluent in Spanish and has added vital bilingual skills to our department to help serve our hispanic community in various roles throughout his career in Moline. Deputy Chief Raya is a 2022 graduate of the FBI National Academy class 282, a prestigious law enforcement ten week executive management program held in Quantico, Virginia. Andrew began his career on patrol, making a significant impact in the Flora Siente neighborhood. His exemplary performance led to assignments with the Illinois State Police, Quincy's Metropolitan Enforcement Group, where he served as an undercover narcotics detective, and later with an assignment with the Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Agency. Andrew was promoted as sergeant in 2017 and returned to patrol as a first line supervisor. In 2018, he transitioned to roles as the sergeant overseeing the community policing unit. In 2020, Andrew was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and returned to the patrol division as the division commander. In 2021, he was appointed commander of the role of Criminal Investigation Division, overseeing the juvenile unit, adult unit, gun unit, Street Crimes Unit and Crime Prevention Unit. Beyond his departmental duties, Andrew has played pivotal roles in various specialized units outside of the department, including since 2020, serving as a supervisor for the Rock Anon County Integrity Task Force, contributing efforts aimed at maintaining integrity and professionalism within law enforcement community. Additionally, he served as the crisis containment unit tactical commander from 2016 to 2021, demonstrating his experience as a team leader and tactical commander in high pressure situations. Last month, Andrew went through a rigorous process for evaluation for the position of deputy chief. I was joined by malayan police deputy Chief Steve van Heisen, Rock island police chief Rich Landy, and retired Davenport police Chief Paul Sikorsky, as well as our human resources department director, Leah Miller, in the evaluation of the candidates. We were all impressed with his performance, leading me to select Andrew as the next deputy chief for the Mawlen Police Department. Andrew is certainly proud. His family are here. With a lot of family members here today, including his wife, Alyssa, who is here, his two children, Olivia, six, and Oscar, three. His dad, Arturo, is here, Kelly and Dale, in laws Samantha and Santana, his sisters and Nick, his brother in law. So, mayor, I'd be honored if you would afford to read the oath of office. Please read your right hand and repeat after me. I, Andrew Ryan.

Oh, here it is. Never mind. Yeah, so real quick, just a couple things about junior achievement, and then we'll jump into the project at Hull. You know, really, J is the world's largest organization dedicated to giving kids the skill sets and the mindsets to build thriving communities like Moline, Illinois. I know a couple council members have volunteered before. I thank you for that. It's really important that we get in front of our kids today and really show them the way. We used to talk a lot about being college and career ready, college and life ready, but now we talk about being career, career and life ready, right? Not every kid needs to go to college to be successful. Trust me, I believe in higher education, but it just isn't for everybody. Right. Today we want to talk a little bit about the benefits of junior achievement in our community. You know, we really teach on three pillars, financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and work and career readiness. We think those three pillars are vital to a student success. We really encourage that financial freedom. Right. When kids understand what financial freedom means, they can really grow and prosper and grow more. JA alumni report that they make 20% higher income than students that did not have junior achievement. That's pretty phenomenal in my book, you know, but I talked about it early. I mean, what if every kid went to college? What would our community look like, right? We'd have a lot of doctors and lawyers and engineers and brilliant city minds. But would we have people that work in the streets department? Will we have people on the park and rec board? We have folks out, you know, in our community doing those jobs that are so necessary. But the big news, and I think that's what we're here for today is talk about the New Jersey center. 25 years ago, we opened up a facility in downtown Davenport. We were the third junior achievement in the country to pilot Ja Biztown. At the time, it was called Exchange City. If you remember that. There's a lot of things that happen at Biztown. The lease on that property up, the lease on the property in Davenport is up this year. So we looked really hard, and we went around and we talked to a lot of different people in a lot of different cities. And I'm happy to say that when vibrant bought the old Sam's club down on John Deere Road, they offered us 13,000 year. That included all the security, the maintenance, the Internet, the parking, the rent. Just a great deal for us, but we have to raise 3.25 million to build that out. But anyway, that's not what we're here to talk about today. We're here to talk about city hall at Biztown. If you can imagine this, a fifth grader goes to Bis Town, and they take out a business loan to run their business for the day. We have a credit union there. We have a factory. We have a transportation area. We have a distribution area. We have a marketing business there. At Biztown, we have. We have a business office. We have philanthropy there. It's like walking down Main street, USA, right? All these buildings and all these storefronts these kids run. So they take out a business loan as a fifth grader, and they have to pay that back. And they do that by selling goods and services. And then when they're on their break, they become consumers and they're buying goods and services. So they really get to understand how the economy flows around the city. But at the center of our community, and the center of every community is city hall, right? City hall drives economic development. I always like to tell people that I think we're the economic incubator in Moline. We really want. We want kids to live here and grow here and stay here. The school district in Moline is doing a phenomenal job with some programs. But at the end of the day, we're thrilled to talk to you about city hall and what the city of Moline can do in that space. We teach a lot of lessons at city hall, right. Kids learn how to vote. They'll vote a mayor in, and the mayor will run the city for the day. We have a city attorney. We have a parks and rec director. There's a public works director there, and they do a lot of things in the city. You'll notice on that screen you see in the upper right hand corner, when kids walk into Biztown, that's going to look like the 74 bridge. So the students will vote on a referendum to light that bridge in their school colors. We think that's pretty cool. They'll also be responsible for maintaining the road that goes through bis town. We'll go back one more. You can see on that bottom floor plan there's a road that goes all the way through bis town. So it's gonna look like grass, and it's gonna look like concrete. So we're gonna be dependent on students to learn about taxes and infrastructure and why those are so important for our roads and our highways, for our police and our fire. I'll tell a quick anecdotal story about a young man that was at Biztown, and we were talking about taxes and where they went, and he started crying, and someone said, what's wrong? And he said, well, my mom doesn't work.

But city hall, again, I mean, really, when we talk about taxes and we talk about goods and services and how the economy works in the free enterprise system, this is a conceptual drawing of what Biztown might look like at the new facility. You can see the seal is in the center there for the city of Mulling. It's not real visible, but just wanted to kind of give you an idea what that might look like. There'll be a large monitor above city hall. When the mayor gives their remarks and talks to the city about it, we'll see things up on the screen. The inside of city hall, we have a lot of ideas, but we would really depend on the city to come back to us and talk about their ideas. We thought it'd be cool if we could highlight all the different jobs that happen in the city. Right. Kids only know what they know again. Right. They don't know about, you know, that. You know, if you ask your kid who owns the library, what do you think they're going to tell you? They probably don't know. You know that the city runs that library, right? And they can work for the city and they can work in that library. So there's a lot going on there. That back wall, you'll see mulling on there. That's just the conceptual drawing of what that back wall might look like to highlight the city. There's another wall on the right hand side. Take time to discover, support, live that can. Talk about your tourism piece if you'd like. It's completely up to you how we design this. I think it's a pretty easy lift for the city. 5000 students in the first year, 100% of only fifth graders in the building. It's a $3.25 million investment. The junior achievement is willing to make in our city. The first year build out cost for the city is $7,500. That includes all the furniture, the computers, the design, the wall wraps, the facade. That's all included in that 1st $7,500 for the first year only. After that, we're asking for an annual investment of $10,000 a year. That helps us to keep the sustainability of our building there and keep the kids coming. So the total investment over a three year period is $37,500. We respectfully asked the city to engage in this project with us. We're excited about it. I know I spoke to a couple of you and you're excited about it too. I don't know if there's any questions or comments or anyone would like to make the council members? Yes. Mister Mercias, thank you. As a volunteer for JA, I've done it for. This will be my 10th year here at Lincoln Irving and I can really firsthand attest how the rigor of the programs I do, fifth grade and even I've learned a lot from the program. But just there's so much that the kids need to be exposed to when it comes to careers. And in my opinion, it just makes sense that the municipal side of it is also a piece that they need to learn about. So yeah, I myself am a volunteer of JA, for the record, and see the value in the organization. Thank you mister. I might just add to that that Alvaro was named our outstanding volunteer last year and it's because of his work to make our curriculum bilingual. And so when we looked at the new facility and we start talking about that, this will be a bilingual facility as well. So thank you Alvaro, for your work. Can I suggest you think trilingual at some point because we have. French is the other language that is predominant in our school district, although there are over 60 languages spoken. Yeah, it's crazy. So just a point of information. We appreciate that I just wanted to mention that all four of my kids went through Ja in Biztown, and they still remember the jobs that they had. They had really great experiences. And I am excited that you are coming tomorrow. So thank you. You know, as I've traveled around the country now and looked at different facilities and trying to model off of those, I always feel like when I come back home, I walked into a basement somewhere. But this new facility is really state of the art. It's not your father's j anymore. And it's very. We're not just moving it from one place to the next. It'll be a much more immersive, experiential journey for the kids when they get there. Thank you, Anna. So, Timmy, my mother used to work at JA and was running health run Biztown, and she talked about it endlessly. I just, I think teaching kids about civic engagement at a young age plants a seed. And one of the issues that we run into is things are happening that people are not engaged, so they don't know. Right. And this is teaching kids to ask the questions early on so that a more informed citizenry is going to help us make the best decisions.

And this is teaching kids to ask the questions early on so that a more informed citizenry is going to help us make the best decisions. So I just think all of these things are working together. I appreciate that. Thanks for the words. I heard you used the term economic driver and economic development. And I wanted to offer to the council members that as we've been involved in conversations about community economic development, one of the things we've noticed is the need for new investors. Right. The new investors in the projects, especially the residential projects that we have. That is that education toward philanthropy, toward business and investment. We have to start somewhere. And I think ja is the best partner we have in terms of introducing all children in the schools to that. What it takes to do that. And of course, the jobs, et cetera, that you talk about is important. But that's a global piece of this that I wanted to make sure I shared, because that is a significant need. We see. And it's a generational issue. Right. If your parents weren't able to do that kind of thing, you might not even know that that's a part of your community that's needed. Yeah, we see them a lot, mayor, that the kids. Not every kid gets it at home. Right. But sometimes they don't get all the information they need either. But thank you, Mister Schmidt. Anybody else? My question is, I think more toward our staff and saying, if we're interested in moving forward with this, what's the appropriate action this evening? I would say if there's a general consensus to proceed forward at the request of junior achievement. Then I have an agreement that I have reviewed and would bring that forward at the next city council meeting to make the commitment. The new facility will open in October of this year. In fact, it looks like October 14. So put that on your calendar. Right. And I think it's a good investment, hopefully. I prefer my consensus. I would concur. And, you know, the only question I have, which again, ken to our staff is where is that going to fit in our budget? How are we going to move that through? But sure, we'll move it through. We can make sure we have been using our contingency dollars as opposed to shifting it from some other pot we have. I don't want to speak for the staff, but I imagine that amount of money is the kind of thing we've used contingency for. Sure. Okay. Thank you so much. Well, thank you for having me. I really appreciate taking the time. And above all, I appreciate your service to our community. It's sometimes can be a thankless job. I understand that. So thank you for what you do. Appreciate it. Thank you. Have a good night, everybody. Thank you, too. And before I close out that item, are there any detractors from Mister Vitas bringing this back to us at this point? Okay. We'll look forward on a future council agenda. Thank you. Thank you. All right, we'll move to our proclamation. The first is a proclamation from for progressive action for the common good to declare April 2024 as Earth month. And I believe PJ Slobojan is with us this evening. Hi. Okay. Did you want to come up and say anything about this? No, we're just appreciative. All the same. Cities in the past have done this. This is our 4th 5th year. All right, so the proclamation reads, whereas Earth Day was first celebrated on April 22, 1970, with the goal of inspiring an appreciation of our nation's natural resources through conservation and protection and whereas, the celebration of this day marks an annual review and commitment to the principles of that first Earth Day and whereas, Earth Day marks a renewed commitment to environmental stewardship and to implementation of sustainability, sustainability efforts and whereas, the global community now faces extraordinary challenges such as environmental degradation, global health issues, climate change, food and water shortages, and whereas, a green economy can be achieved on the individual level through education, public policy and consumer activism campaigns and whereas, the city of Moline celebrates Earth Day by extending it to the month of April in recognition of the commitment to environmental stewardship and whereas, the city of Moline residents are encouraged to implement practices designed to preserve and protect our environment and shape the future of our environmental security. Now, therefore, I, Sangeetha Rayapatti, Mayor of Moline, do hereby proclaim the month of April, 2024 as Earth month in the city of Moline, Illinois.

I don't believe there's anyone here from this organization this evening, so we will make sure they get that. Thank you. Is there any public comment this evening, chief? We have Diane Moore. Yes, thank you. I think you've added another row, and you know that chief will be timing it at three minutes. Well, the first thing I wanted to talk to you about is the open meeting policy that should be upheld by all meetings being held at the city hall. I came in March to a plan commission meeting. I got here late. It was 515. The meeting was still going and the door was locked and I could not get in. And people, not everybody is free at 04:00 or 430 or five. In my case, yes, I could have made four, except I had a sick dog and had to go to the vets, take him home. And I made it by 515 and I know the meeting was still going. I tried to text somebody up here to come down and let me in. It didn't happen. I know you don't want to have the building open, but at the same time you have to have it open to people who want to come. And really, 04:00 to 05:00 is a hard time for a lot of people who are working to get to anyway. I think that's another concern I've always had. So that is my concern, that you are not really following an open meeting policy. And I just want to point that out. The other one is, have we eliminated the Moline center program for the city of Moline? Because I saw that as something that you are talking about or voting on. And so I had no idea that that was going on. And maybe it has changed. If you stay for the committee of the whole, I believe Mister Marsky will explain that. It will be explained coming from them. Okay. Just so you know something, the city is okay. Thank you. Thank you. All right, Jeff Dismay. Okay, thank you, mayor, members of city council and members of city staff. My name is Jeff Dismar. I am chair of the Moline Public Art Commission. And this evening on your agenda, you have an item in a program that we are endorsing and putting forth to you for the public art sculpture program. City of Moline has participated in the program for six years, initially in 2007 and eight, and then from 2020 through the present time. The public art commission was formed about two and a half years ago and we picked up that as last year, and we placed four sculptures throughout the city of Moline. This year, we seek to evolve our approach to concentrate our efforts on creating a sculpture walk in the downtown along Fifth Avenue. We picked five sites along Fifth Avenue from 13th through 19th intersections and that's part of your packet to review. We feel our public art commission feels this strategic placement allows for the city to have a more identifiable, walkable public sculpture walk. We envision a corridor become more vibrant with art and culture and community, and enriched city's identity and foster economic revitalization. We feel this works with the downtown and our commission is exceptional. To endorse this, we also have. This program is done in conjunction with Quad City Arts to facilitate and we have selected six sculptures that we feel are outstanding and you'll review those this evening in marketing a public sculpture program. Quad City Arts also works in partnership with Quad cities and to add sculptures to the public art mapping through busit Quad cities. They promote public art trail and incentivize the public to check out these locations with monetary prizes that will further drive people to walk past businesses and storefronts. And as city of Moline, by supporting this sculpture walk, we can continue to pave the way for more public spaces that reflect who we are as a community. And I thank you very much for supporting the arts and look forward to hearing your comments. Thank you. Other Calvert good evening. My name is Heather Calvert.

And I thank you very much for supporting the arts and look forward to hearing your comments. Thank you. Other Calvert good evening. My name is Heather Calvert. I'm the executive director at Butterworth center in Dear Wyman House and here this evening to speak in favor of your agenda item 8.0, the landmarking status for Deer Wyman House. As the staff report would have said, the home was built in 1872 and housed four generations of John Deere's descendants. But to build a little bit on what Dougal said since being given to the foundation in 1976, he likened JA to an economic incubator and I considered your Wyman house and Butterworth center as well to be service incubators for our community. Last year, we had over 185 unique reservations across our site to help support nonprofit work, education and community service. And so supporting this landmark status not only helps recognize an important piece of our community's history, but also the history that we continue to make. Thank you. Thank you very much. Alexandria Lunas good evening, Mayor Ripuddy, members of the council, Alexandra Elias, representing Renew Moline public art is intended by its nature to be evocative and promote public discourse. I'm here today in that spirit, Renew Moline has actively supported a public art program for the last five years. In 2018, with the support of our board of directors, Ren Nu requested $50,000 from the Moline Community foundation, and they liked the idea so much that they gave us $65,000 to draft a public art and place making plan. We immediately engaged the community leaders and established a steering committee to help us select a consulting firm. Participants on that steering committee included Dave Harrell from visit Quad Cities, Kevin Maynard from Quad City Arts, Gabe Burnett from Azib Wik African American Arts Council and Zenaida Landeros, who was then the greater hispanic chamber director. During the spring of 2020, as we embarked on our public engagement for the public art plan, George Floyd was murdered. We watched as public art became a powerful tool to express community grief, frustration and despair. We felt what we were doing was important. We were delighted when Mayor Ryapuddy and the council approved the public art and place making plan in August of 21 and have watched as the Public Art commission began its work to implement the plan. The steering committee also helped us at that time to choose an artist for the windows of the Spiegel building. That project was also a partnership with Renu, paying $10,000 for the artist managing the selection process and the city providing the building space with public works assisting with the installation. The mural was specifically designed for those windows and that building in that location to express the importance of that place by making use of the word possibility. I'm proud of that project, which looks as good today as it did the day it was installed. Further, the artist, Brandon Neese, a moline native whose african american family stood proudly on the day it was unveiled, has gone on to other great projects. We do not feel that Fifth Avenue is the right place for ready made sculptures that are rotated among communities. The rotating sculpture program has historically placed those pieces on existing sculpture pads, which, if this proposal is accepted, would remain empty. We think the sculpture pads should have sculptures on them before adding new locations. If sculptures are going to be placed along Fifth Avenue, the council should determine appropriate locations, and then the area should be presented as an artist opportunity to seek an artist to express the specialness of Fifth Avenue through a specific design and a cohesive, planned installation, not what is available in the sculpture database. I appreciate your time this evening. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you. Anyone else? Chief? All right, we'll move to item seven. Questions on the agenda. There's one update for you. The council meeting minutes from March 26, 2024, reflect that Elderperson Castro gave an invocation. This was a scrivener's error. The minutes will be approved as amended. Thank you. If there's nothing further, we'll move to item 8.1, a resolution authorizing the mayor and city clerk to execute and attest to an agreement between the city of Moline and Quad City Towing, Inc. To provide towing services for the city of Moline. Mister Vitas? Yeah. Very, very briefly, we're recommending approval of the agreement with Quad City Taung, Inc. Who is a longstanding business partner here in Moline, and his associate historically provided tilling services based upon an RFP that did go out through the police department with numerous companies with interest. They are the most responsible firm that we'd like to continue to do business with. Thank you. Motion to approve. Second motion by Schmidt. Seconded by Castro. Discussion? Hearing? None. All in favor? Any opposed? That motion passes. 8.2, an ordinance designating the Deer Wyman house, carriage house, and grounds as a local historic landmark site in accordance with chapter 25, planning and development, article four, historic preservation of the molling code of ordinances.

Mister Vitas or Mister Marsky? I'm going to actually ask Mister Marsky to come to the podium. He has worked on this for some time, and I know that historically there has been some duplication of effort that has gone on dating back to the time that Jeff Manis actually worked for the administrator's office and was managing SSA number six as well as the main Moline center main street program. So with that, please feel free. Okay, well, the background on it is I started as the Moline center program manager January of last year. I knew coming into it there was some work to do on deciding how the program operated and more specifically how everything related to the mulling Center Main street program. So we've done a lot of work to jump in and do the work of the Mullein center program during the last year, but at the same time also learn more about how Main street programs operate, not just in the state of Illinois, but in other places, and then specifically how it is here in Moline, and then analyze how the program works. The way that it was set up here in Moline with the Main street program is a little bit different than some other places in the sense that there's a big difference between the start of a Main street program and one that's been around for 15 years and more in terms of energy and direction and those kinds of things. Add to that the fact that the state of Illinois actually discontinued the Main street program in 2015. There was a move away from Main street programming in a lot of communities for a period of time here in Moline. The commission stayed with the typical framework of the Main street program, which would include committees and committee reports and having an active board. What I've noticed by looking through the minutes and the other documents that I, I could find about the Main street commission during the last four or five years is there was a move away from the Main street program being the driving force of what happens downtown. It was part of it, but there was this emergence of a mullein center program. And so then there was this confusion over what's the Moline center program, what's the Main street commission, and how do those work together or separately? And seemed to be a lot of ambiguity. There were no committees in the last four or five years. From what I can tell, it's more of an advisory board rather than an active board. And so all things considered, what we tried to do is kind of define what the Moline center program is, what it does for the downtown area and the community as a whole. With the other parts of the program, that includes the SSA boards, that includes city staff, that includes the community and the merchants, and then with that kind of analyze where the Moline Center Main street program fits into that. And so the recommendation we made to the Main street commission was to solidify the program and maybe shift some resources over to the other parts of the program, including the SSA board. And the commission voted to dissolve the Main street commission. So I don't know if that brings you all the way up to speed. I'm here to answer more questions. But that's kind of where we're at, is many of the members of the commission", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Quad City Towing, Inc.", "insights": [{"observation": "Quad City Towing, Inc. is a longstanding business partner providing towing services based on an RFP process through the police department.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Deer Wyman House", "insights": [{"observation": "Designating the Deer Wyman house, carriage house, and grounds as a local historic landmark.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Moline Center Main Street Commission", "insights": [{"observation": "Repealing the Moline Center Main Street Commission due to duplication of effort and lack of active board participation.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "Quad City Towing, Inc.", "insights": [{"observation": "Quad City Towing, Inc. is a longstanding business partner providing towing services based on an RFP process through the police department.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Deer Wyman House", "insights": [{"observation": "Designating the Deer Wyman house, carriage house, and grounds as a local historic landmark.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}]}, {"name": "Moline Center Main Street Commission", "insights": [{"observation": "Repealing the Moline Center Main Street Commission due to duplication of effort and lack of active board participation.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 2411830, "chunk_end_time": 2823304, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJw5YV3uDys", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJw5YV3uDys&t=2411s"}, {"start": 39000, "end": 45000, "text": "d seemed to be a lot of ambiguity.

But that's kind of where we're at, is many of the members of the commission are also on the SSA board, and so there's nine members on that board. The functions of what we would normally do with the main street commission would shift in other ways, we still are involved with the merchants, the community, the Keith Moline Beautiful Commission, the public art commission. It's just, even though we're looking at taking something away from the equation, we're actually adding and building to the mowing center program. So it's just kind of a restructuring and adding some specificity, and creating an organization that has more clearly defined roles and responsibilities, I guess. Thank you. Is there a motion? Motion to approve? Second motion by Finch. Seconded by Macias. Discussion. I wasn't sure if that was the hand up to speak, Mister Schmidt, or not. I guess it's not. I wasn't sure either yet. Okay, Mister Macias. Thank you. And I've been part of the commission for maybe less than a year. So there's people been there for a lot longer, a lot of these business owners. And they really just basically said, it's a lot of repetitiveness from the other, the SSA boards and whatnot. And it's all the same people. So, yeah, just in the short time that I was there, I just saw the efficiency. And I credit you for seeing that and actually working on improving the processes as opposed to just keeping the workload that was there before, as usual. So that was just my observation during my time there. Thank you for sharing that. Yes, Mister Schmidt. Yeah, and that my experience prior to elder personal Macias was very similar in that it was the advisory board, but really. And it has basically no budget. Right. The budget is all basically borrowed from the ssas. And so you're recommending to a board which was mostly duplicative, to spend the money. Yeah, there's a budget for the operating costs associated with the Moline center program, which includes the main street commission. But the commission itself did not have its own budget. And that's one of the things we looked at, is maybe we keep the commission, but there's a budget given to it. Well, then you have to communicate to the people who are giving the money. And then is that practical and efficient? And so we just thought it would make the recommendation to, like I said, just kind of channel the resources another way. And we can still implement, you know, committees and other things that a commission would do. But it's just. It's how the direction we've gone in, I guess. Thank you, Mister Schmidt. Go ahead. No, and I think it makes sense. I think it sounds scarier than it is on paper when you say we're dissolving the mulling center commission. But what we're really doing is taking a situation where we had three boards operating and consolidating onto the two that were the most functional while also then still focusing on maintaining the program and keeping it going. And I just think as we communicate that out, it'll just be important for us to maintain that messaging. Absolutely. Because I think for most outsiders, understanding like what the SSA board, that doesn't track to most people, it's saying that that work is still being done in those places. I think it's just an important part of communicating it. But yeah, very in favor of the plea, doctor. Thank you. Anything further from the council hearing? None. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed?

A court to allow for improvements that include the installation of a four foot wide concrete retainer wall topped by a privacy fence. Mister Vitas, well, or Mister Lodi, both of us, actually. We've been working on this for some time. I'm just going to lay it out there. I'm not a strong supporter and never have been a strong supporter of allowing any encroachments in the public right of way or in any public utility easements because of the complications it presents for the future. This request came in and out of respect to the property owners, we bring it forward to you as a council to deliberate and make a determination as to whether or not you believe it should be approved so that a swimming pool could be built, a retaining wall could be constructed, a fence placed on top of the retaining wall, and this is a drainage easement is the best way to describe it. So with that, Tony, if you want to add anything to it and on the record, I'm opposed to this easement. Just lay it out there. So this request initially came to planning and zoning and then they kicked it over to us to look at how our utilities would function. The subdivision, I believe it's Beaver woods subdivision, was built within the last 20 years or so over by Blackhawk College and it included a utility easement slash drainage easement along the northern edge, which is also adjacent to the 34th Avenue right of way. This easement contains a fire hydrant that comes into the easement by a few feet. The encroachment will not affect our ability to operate or maintain the fire hydrant and our stormwater manager has also looked at this and concluded that the construction of these improvements wouldn't affect the drainage of the area as well. There may be some privately owned utilities also in this utility easement that the petitioner would be obligated to engage with, into a license agreement with, with those privately owned utilities as well. Is it. We haven't put it on the floor yet. Do you want a motion to put it on for discussion? Wait, sorry. Miss Kostopoulos, can you please advise how we do a discussion? If council would like to discuss, there should be a motion as second. A motion to approve. Motion to approve by Timian. Is there a second? 2nd by Castro. Mister Timian. So I see there's a five foot space still from that hydrant. I'm looking at the hand drawn. It's a little bit easier to consume. On page 17 there's a five foot space still. Do we have a, is there a code for hydrant spacing? And what is that? 3ft. Okay. Second, a four foot concrete retaining wall with a privacy fence on top. Does that exceed or is this the 4ft the width? That's what it is. That's the depth. I'm curious to know if the retaining wall plus the fence on top will exceed zoning requirements for height. So we would have a six foot height limitation on the fence in the front yard. Okay. Is that on top of or in total? We would look at the, we would look at the grade of the lot. So if you're talking about a retaining wall that's level back at the average grade, then we would still just consider that a six foot tall. So it's off of the front of the house. So we would look at the average grade of the lot, which I haven't had a chance to look at. Okay, thank you. Okay, so speaking of not having a full information for council, right? Like if we don't know that information right now, but you would like it in order to make a decision also, wouldn't we? Wouldn't it be logical to know whether the private company utilities are going to allow an easement before the city gives up parts of the right of way? That's a question for Marvin, I guess. I don't know. You get what I mean? Does the council understand? What I'm saying is that what is the proper order of operations here? Our agreement makes your license condition on licenses from private utilities. So you know, somebody has to go first. Okay. But that still. What still remains is the detailed answer to mister Tooming's question about any height restrictions. Correct? Any the data on whether this plan puts them out of compliance with any height restrictions. Am I correct? Did I interfere you correctly? Yeah. I don't. That's something we could certainly do, mayor. Okay, Mister T. It's my understanding that six foot is the requirement. And any fence they put in would be capped out at that. Regardless of. That doesn't affect the easement agreement. This is just. I was asking about the defense on top of the wall, so. Okay, thank you. I'm sorry, I was putting them together. Any other questions from the council, Mister Macias? Thank you, your honor. What about the drainage? What kind of problems could that cause with the drainage? There will. The drainage swale is north of the area where these improvements were really wouldn't affect much. Okay. Miss Castro, have we heard from any of our neighbors in opposition of this at all? I've heard nothing. Anything further? Yes, Mister Schmidt.

It's not, there's not any kind of special approval that would be required from the planning and zoning commission. It's only because of the easement. Correct. Okay, Miss Kostopoulos, did you want to add. So I believe that when Mister Lodi said it went to the plane commission and they referred it back to utilities and PNC, they deferred. So they had no role here. Okay. Thank you for the clarity. Anything further for the council? All right, hearing. None. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? That motion passes. All right, we move to our informationals 9.1 law enforcement grant opportunities. Chief Galt, thank you for the time, your honor. Just wanted to update the council and maybe get a little bit of consensus or direction on seeking some grants. As you know, grants are labor intensive and require a lot of both work on the front end and the reporting on the back end. And some of them require no cost match or involvement with the city finances and some require significant contribution. In your packet you should have. A document was prepared by my police business analyst who has brought this to my attention for some upcoming grant opportunities, including the first one, United States Department of Justice Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness act. This is a 24 month project period with no cost matched to the city. We would ask for $200,000 to support in house, internally programs that would benefit officers at the Millennium Police Department, including emotional and mental health, peer mentoring, suicide prevention and stress reduction. In other police officer family services. We currently have a contract with 1041, Inc. At Wellness company to provide services. It's fairly limited in scope. It's not a very expensive contract. What we would like to do is add to that and contract a specific wellness coordinator at the police department to work on these various things, as you can see in that program. The second one is the United States Department of Justice CPD Micro grant officer recruitment retention and workforce diversification. The mayor actually brought these to my attention, these micro grants, after one of her actual, I think, meetings with the cop's office. This is again a 24 month project period with no cost match to the city. We would ask for $175,000 for recruitment and retention. If you recall, the city last year invested $50,000 for marketing campaign. I think it was a successful to some extent. It didn't produce a lot of applicants for us, but that's kind of the national narrative that we're dealing with. And so our proposal here would be to kind of enhance that with a specific recruitment coordinator, referral incentives and other things like the implementation of the 30 by 30 initiative to increase women in the workforce. So that's some more details laid out in there. So those are two that are probably easy for you to say. Yes, because they don't require any match from the city finances. Pretty low risk, little to no risk at all. The next one that I'd really like you to put some thought to is the Bureau of Justice Assistance connect and protect law enforcement Behavioral Health Response program. That is a 36 month program. And please note that this is a cost match, and that is an escalating match requirement of 20% in the first two years and 40% in year three. As you know, in the city strategic plan, holistic health awareness is one of the goals. This isn't specifically enumerated in subsections of that, but would certainly fit in that this is an external program that affect the community. Previously, we had things like goals expand the CYFS program, which alderman Timian championed to fund that last or this current fiscal year. I love the program, but I'm going to be honest with you, it's not enough for the community. Right. And so what we would propose is potentially asking for $550,000.

Previously, we had things like goals expand the CYFS program, which alderman Timian championed to fund that last or this current fiscal year. I love the program, but I'm going to be honest with you, it's not enough for the community. Right. And so what we would propose is potentially asking for $550,000. But that requires you to commit $75,000 in year 175 thousand dollars in year two and $166,000 in year three, according to their very complicated formula that we had to get guidance on. But those are the dollar match, a $236,000 match over three years. Again, in our contract with CYFS, they're a private company that provides limited social workers embedded in our police department. What we're finding is that we could really benefit from a dedicated, full time case manager and case coordinator, relieve some of that from the police department, be able to follow it all the way through, do a better job with that. There's some HIPAA barriers that we're kind of battling a little bit with police being involved in that. So we can maybe contract that with them to. I'm sorry, I did tell you the wrong number. 236 is not correct. It's 316. 667. If you would have done the math, you would have recognized that I was wrong. I had a sticky note here to update that dollar amount. So I am concerned about the match, and I don't know if I'm 100% on board with it just because of the significant match in year three, but I wanted to bring it forward. So you understand the grants that are available, this is an external grant. It would affect the community, but it's a significant investment. I mean, 75, 75, and 166 is not a small amount of money. And so we can come back and talk about those. I just want to also let you know some of the other grants. We have a lot of grants that we pursue. We have an annual human services Illinois Department of Human Services tobacco education program that we do. We get that every year. Bulletproof vest program every year annual. And we're pursuing an Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority grant to buy a new live scan machine, which is our digital fingerprint and mugshot camera, to upgrade that system. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Jag Grant. We get about sixteen thousand dollars to twenty thousand dollars a year that supplements equipment such as gas masks, mobile field force, and our crisis containment unit programs. With twice we've been awarded the Homeland Security Port Security grant. That is because we're on the waterway of the Mississippi river and we're part of that. We do a lot of training and stuff like that. We received that twice. We are applying for that again. We are applying for the Illinois law enforcement alarm system less lease fault alternatives grant, which would give us some, hopefully, if we receive reimbursement for our Taser program that you fund through budget with our officers that carry tasers. All of the officers are assigned a Taser. And then we have a first time grant that we're looking to partner with the school district, Moline School District on stop school violence prevention program. And then that would probably compliment with the bottom one there, the school violence prevention program. That's a 25% match. We've gotten that before. You did authorize that in 2021, or the council at that time did. And that's how we added cameras at all the crosswalks. So both of those programs would be a partnership with the school district and likely expand the camera programs in their parking lots and other areas on the exterior of their building. So look forward to your comments or questions, just with looking for some direction on your preference on us pursuing any, all or none of those grants. Thank you, mister Timian. Then Mister Mesillas. Okay, Mister Timmy. Thank you. Your honor. A few questions. First on the first grant, highly supportive. I think it's great. Is there an exit or is this after the two year period is over, will this just be something that we will continue to fund? Yeah. So I think we could do one of two things, right. We could exit, completely separate it, or we could budget for anything that we've developed during that period of time, possibly reallocate dollars. There is no long term commitment to this. One of the things I'd like to see is the effectiveness of the program. Right. Is what are the measurables I think, and I know that you're in a little bit of the space in your day job, but some of the problem that we have, particularly with health and wellness, both internally and the police department externally, is the measurable. And I'm just. I don't know what those would be, and I would really like to see that before I would make any type of budgetary recommendation to continue it. And, you know, the other thing is, there's always new things out there. Maybe we pivot to something new, and I think that we would really have to take a deep dive at that time. In theory, it could be retention, job satisfaction, depression, measures of the police force, you know, which would all be well worth the investment. And I guess for the third one, you mentioned the HIPAA issues. I'm currently in the process of hipifying our entire application, so I understand the pains. Is this something that it is able to help with if we need to create completely separate systems? Yeah. So it's more of just an access to the information that we're not privy to. Right. Is because we're partnering with a healthcare provider, that we're not healthcare providers. We do have a business agreement that the city's already entered into, but it's. And I'd have to jump into the legalese of it, but it's really that just. It's none of our business, I guess, in layman's terms. So all the proper safeguards will be put. They are in place. Yeah, we really don't. The problem that we have is the follow up.

Yeah, we really don't. The problem that we have is the follow up. And so not to get on my soapbox here, and the mayor will know that I'm all over this mental health problem in our community, but the problem that we have is the healthcare system is a may do system, and the criminal justice system is a must do system. Right. We tell you you have to do something. Well, then, when these two worlds come together, the may do and the must do system, it's like, well, we think you should do this. And we're not going to ask you if you're ever a client or getting counseling or doing anything, because then it's highly protected information. We have that same problem internally with police officers. It's like, hey, you know, sorry that you're having personal problems. Alcoholism, divorce problems, whatever. We'd love to help. Here are the opportunities. But then, as an employer, we really can't follow up. It's like this weird. Like two things collide. So that's kind of a high level view of it. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, Miss Castro, I just had a question. I'm all in favor of the top two. For the third one, I do have a question. Do we have in the area, like the Quad City area, I mean, can they support that type of system? I mean, do we have the. I mean, I thought sometimes there's a lack of, like, use, the lack of follow up with the whole systems and things like that. So do we have a. Should I reserve my comments? No. I was wondering if. I guess you asked if, you know, if it'd be something that we would want to put money to. But, I mean, I think that we could and we should. But do we have the support to be able to manage that type of program? Well, I can tell you, I think probably in small scale, and I think that the more that we can do to provide that on a local or micro level probably is helpful. Yeah. There's no secret that I've been highly critical of the overall system in the area, and I think that we're hoping that the things that we're putting into place could make it better. But you're right. We are. I don't know what the proper word is. Handcuffed to the system. Right. That we don't have a lot of control over, I think some of these. So, for example, a case manager and a case coordinator sometimes help things not fall through the cracks. And if you've ever been involved in the system, if you will, the mental health or the healthcare system, it's easy to get lost in the cracks. It's easy to get frustrated with the services. It's super confusing. It's overwhelming. And we've tried a couple of different approaches that we've spearheaded. One of them is kind of a Mayo health clinic approach that we're working on with Rock Island county probation, where we try to get everybody to the table and say, what services can help this individual? What we found is that that person, to kind of shepherd it through the process, is more helpful to a person, a family in need, particularly when there's a juvenile involved, than any other solution that we've seen. I would say that, first off, thank you for listening to me about the 30 by 30 program. So, you know that that's something. Something I picked up at a us conference of mayors, heard about it, and am always thankful for the leadership you give to women in the force. I think that there's data that we need for that bigger one with the three year commitment. Certainly everything you've said about case management, I believe it. We know that that's the case. That's why the project now has a level up? Because we need people to be followed through their case, managing the people in the level up program, but data on what is a juvenile, what is the situation with our numbers of juveniles that are systems impacted right now? Right. Where do we see the trend heading in Moline, in the Quad Cities, et cetera, so that we know how big of an impact investment in that area could have. Clearly, we all care about safety for everyone in the community, but when it comes to these specific areas, issues that you're talking about, if we had a little more data on that that might help the council, I could just tell you anecdotally. Well, first, I know I did mention juveniles. This isn't just strictly related to juveniles. So it is adult and juvenile. And I can tell you, and I know the fire chief had backed me up, that it's. The data is enormous. The underlying problems that are not being addressed are enormous. The data is overwhelming all of our run numbers. I know you've probably seen some of these. His run numbers from EMS, particularly related to mental health, are enormous. Our call volume is at the highest it's ever been. Our 911 calls not just related to this, but all are the highest they've ever been. CeSA, the Community Emergency Services Supports act, is coming forward probably now, if it gets pushed off the spring session until July 1, 2025, is going to probably put even more burden on the fire department or EMS systems, hospital systems.

As we think about the behavioral health response program, I understand hesitations, and of course, we need to be looking at those numbers and having that before us. And I do understand that we're not going to be able to fix every problem in that system. But I do think it's important we continue to push and lead on that, because I think it helps residents, everyone who's here. I think it also provides that better support to our officers, to our fire personnel as well, because, like, we know the people are just going to keep coming back and needing help over and over again. And even if the system is not there, that should be picking them up. Anything we can do that helps and even takes a portion of that back. I mean, certainly we have to be mindful of the cost of it, but I think it's a way we have to pursue forward so very supportive of that and appreciate every step that's gone forward with that, and being realistic about the challenges and that we're not going to fix everything. If there's nothing further, I'll leave a final word. Is that you mentioned the causes, the root causes. Right. We talk about this a lot when it comes to what programs do we want to invest in. If these grants and matches will help us get at the root cause, then we have a fighting chance of changing the tide. But if it is throwing a band aid on the situation, we're just pushing the problems farther down the road. So if we can be very careful in how we examine it. I would be preaching to the choir to tell you this, but it's like a bloomin onion, right, at Texas roadhouses, that every time you pull one back, it's another issue. I know you and I have worked diligently on some of these issues, and it's really. It's sad how far we need to go, and I don't know that I have the answers to that. Like, which one you do first or which one you attack first? Because it's so layered. I just want to be transparent about that. Yeah. Thank you. All right. 9.2 public art commission request for rotating sculpture program Mister Matthias. Thank you. So you heard in public comment today, two comments on this project. Staff simply want to bring this to you tonight to get some direction from you before we. So we can better assist the public art commission how we move forward here. So you heard about this $13,600 proposal from Quad City Arts to place sculptures throughout Moline center? One thing I want to point out this, if we choose to, if you give staff the blessing to move forward with this, we will be bringing back a sole source approval of some kind, because QC Arts is the only thing. We're under 15,000. But we do need to, per the policy, get non, or, excuse me, get competitive informal quotes. So they're the only provider of this. Just a few things, I guess, to point out about it. I don't feel that this proposal's contrary to our public art plan. I've looked through the plan. I do feel like staff's role in this is to support the public art commission. But it is to make sure we're complying with that plan. Right. I'm not gonna come in and tell you what good art is, what bad art is, but I'm gonna tell you if something is completely not in congruence with your plan, the second thing I'll say about it is you've got all the maps of the different locations there. We have. Staff have ruled out the a locations. They don't meet the city engineers requirements. They don't meet planning and zoning's requirements. The b locations, once we get. Once we get a sculpture, because right now we know the possible locations. Okay. City engineer and myself, we're okay with those b locations. The police chief is going to want to see the actual height of those sculptures and where they go to make sure they don't block downtown cameras. So that'll be something. As we. If we did move forward with this, we were going to verify each location's height and size. And we don't know. We know. We know the sculptures that we think we're getting, that we voted on. We don't know exactly if we're going to get them yet and which locations they'll be going to. So that would be something we would verify if you want to move forward with this. The only thing else, I guess I'll point out is, like I said, just, we will be coming back with an actual agreement, which we don't have yet. But I would come back to you with a sole source approval and then an agreement that ties the actual work here with Kwazi Arts and those locations and sculptures. But main thing is to get some. To get your opinion on this. If this is something that you want to have, these certain locations on Fifth Avenue will continue to support it. Do you want to consider other locations or like Alex had brought up, that we have some existing pads around downtown. I believe one is at Mercado, one is at Cone Tower, one is at the plaza. And then there's another one by the channel cat. So happy to take any direction from you or answer any questions. City council.

The only thing else, I guess I'll point out is, like I said, just, we will be coming back with an actual agreement, which we don't have yet. But I would come back to you with a sole source approval and then an agreement that ties the actual work here with Kwazi Arts and those locations and sculptures. But main thing is to get some. To get your opinion on this. If this is something that you want to have, these certain locations on Fifth Avenue will continue to support it. Do you want to consider other locations or like Alex had brought up, that we have some existing pads around downtown. I believe one is at Mercado, one is at Cone Tower, one is at the plaza. And then there's another one by the channel cat. So happy to take any direction from you or answer any questions. City council. Are those existing pads? Are those empty? Yes, they're empty right now. And so they would be. If we go through with these, those would be empty, remain empty this year. And what is does that cost? You quoted include the installation of new pads for these new locations. So they will just. They will attach to the sidewalk and they will be removed when they're done. So they won't need to be pat. It includes everything to install the school. And then what? Who repairs the sidewalk from attaching? So, yeah, that was one of my. I guess my main question with this, as you look at this nice street skating that you have, right? And it's like, okay, well, how many holes can you put in this? I did. I mean, the size of what is didn't seem very like it was very damaging to see some of those. But I do think if we approve this, I think part of it should be in the agreement that there'll be some kind of epoxy or something put in those holes. Something that meets the city engineers requirements to like make sure those holes are safely repaired. Thank you Mister Timian. I love public art. I'm going to wax eloquently for a minute about Fifth Avenue. I used to ride my bike up and down it as a kid trying to hit the lights. So I got all greens because it was timed and it was really hard for like a ten year old. But it is. I heard someone recently describe it as like, it's like a Hallmark movie. It is like this really unique spot in Moline. And with that in mind, I would personally prefer Fifth Avenue be filled with art that is acquired through an RFP and is, for lack of a better term, instagrammable. It is something that people can share and entices others to come in to do the same thing. And a rotating art program wouldn't be that. And to the point we can't even. We might ensure that this sculpture meets requirements, but every year we have to then check height issues again with engineering and only and limit our selection to that. It is my personal preference that Fifth Avenue is curated art more so rotating. And we keep the existing pads for that program. That's me personally. And just to clarify, this is for this one year. Thank you Mister Schmidt. Yeah, I understand objections to moving forward with Fifth Avenue and I do think obviously we have that responsibility of looking at it on that long term perspective. But I think there also is an advantage to saying, hey, we're not there yet. And this is something that can be done in the immediate opportunity, that is, it's available. I think it draws more attention than just putting them back onto the same pads. I mean, there the. I've seen people downtown engaging with the art. I mean, it does happen, but I think this puts it in a way that is different and that can push that out. But it also, the somewhat temporary nature of it doesn't preclude a change to how that's functioned again in the future and kind of a return to that path. And as we look towards what may be a more permanent installations there, I kind of fell right down the middle because I think there's, like you said, prose to both ways. But I don't think this precludes us from anything down the path. And I'm inclined to follow the guidance of our appointed public art commission and trust their recommendation and see what this gains us in that one year, and then we can always make that decision in the future if we need to change it. Anyone else? Mister Macias? Thank you, your honor. Well, and I think we also have the brand new mural on fifth. So there's always. There's been something in place. I think it would complement it. While I do like the idea, and I don't know what the conversations are with the commission of some permanent stuff that will always be there and really truly identifies with Moline and just will be there forever, that people could come back ten years later and know there's this statue and whatnot. I really don't see a problem with something like this. I work in downtown Bettendorf and they've had this program for a very long time. And we see the rotating art. The one thing that I do know, there's some pieces that you want to keep, but then they sell them. So there is that, but it keeps it fresh. You never know what you're going to get. So, I mean, if it's just for one year, I really think it'll make a difference. Compliment a mural. But I would also would be interested to see what long term goals there are in talks about permanent fixtures. We are talking about it long term, a couple long term products of the commission right now. So be happy to share the minutes with you. Okay, thank you. Anything further from this council? You've gotten a mixture of opinions. For my part, I think we do really need to be mindful of costs to repair a beautiful streetscape and sidewalk scape that we have right now. That is a cost I wouldn't. That's like we're adding cost to ourselves unintentionally. And that's ridiculous, you know. Okay, well, we'll keep it moving forward.

We're finally at this point and I think we're all grateful. So you got used to short meetings. Come on. Yeah, I know. Spoiled. It was a good month for the city. It was a good first quarter, as you'll see when we bring our quarterly action plan forward to you. But there's a few highlights, I think, for the record, so that the public who's listening or watching on YouTube later, par instrument phase one, obviously, major, major win for the city. Probably the biggest win we've had in the economic development sphere for as long as I've been here and probably long before I got here. So the groundbreaking, I believe, is the 19th, if I'm not mistaken. So please plan on attending. It's this Friday or this Friday. The 12th. I'm sorry? The 12th. It should be short, sweet, but it'll be really great. And it is a historic moment for the city, celebrating a company that's almost as old as the city. So really wonderful news on a simple, simple process, but a complicated process and one that haunts every city. Records disposal. I want to compliment this clerk, and I'm going to call her out because she, you know, I told her when we were interviewing her and hiring her, I go, records management. Records management is an important thing, right? Because the clerk's office is 100% responsible for all city records. Just simple as that. And she took the bull by the horn. She ran with it. She's worked with the departments, she's worked with the state. She actually got the state to respond and do things that I haven't seen them do prior to her being here. So I don't know what she did. Maybe bent an arm or so. But we're ready to start disposing of public old records. And my compliments to our new city clerk on getting that done. And we will continue to move forward with disposal of records and looking at ways to digitize records in the future so that, that way we don't have volumes of paperwork as we do in the basement of city hall. I want to compliment the HR department as well. They're busy over there. There's a lot going on. They oftentimes don't get recognized for what they do, but they did manage to bring on a new HR manager who is sitting here this evening to the left of Liam Miller. Brandon Tidwell. Welcome, Brandon. Great to have you on board. And we're looking forward to some great training programs coming out of HR for all employees. It's really, really important not only for retention, but for attraction. And then last but not least, just kind of a point, pointing out that the folks at IDOT did tentatively approve a permit for the skate park should the city decide to go forward with that project and find the appropriate funding sources. As for all projects on the riverfront, so bringing that forward. And when I say skatepark, I mean skatepark slash pump track. Right. We just kind of shorten it to skate park. But it does mean both. So with that, if you have questions. Wonderful. I know I do get some emails a occasionally from you as you see the report. And here we go. Mister Timmy does the skate park pump track permit have an expiration? I do not recall seeing an expiration on it. What I do recall seeing is that in order to go forward now, we would move to an appropriate design. So they've already accepted the preliminary conceptual work that was done by new world, new line skating. Thank you. So conceptually, they're in agreement. So now what would happen is we would have to develop those plans, bring them forward, and they would have the final say on whether those plans meet with their expectations. And it's basically maintenance related and accessibility for maintenance to the, you know, to the superstructure of the bridge itself. So that being said, it's really great. So, hoping to move forward with that as we wrap up our plans and our discussions with MkSk this summer. So all good things, yours in the making. Anybody else? Questions? I want to compliment HR as well. Congrats on being a part of this ICMA internship presentation. I'm really excited that that internship program we've worked on continues to move forward. That's wonderful. So it pairs nicely with what Dougal was talking about in terms of showing kids opportunity here in moline. I'm happy to see there's positive movement on McManus pub. Good Lord, save the sign. And happy to see that. Actually, I wrote down I love seeing in, I think it's the clerk's area or legal area, the weekly ordinance and resolution review so that we don't miss things. Things don't get fall through the cracks or not get filed and things like that. That's awesome. I did want to note they wrote in one of those sections that we are basically reporting the infractions toward code, especially with things that I'm involved with as liquor commissioner.

Have shut down a place that was operating without a food or a liquor liquid, a tobacco license, and worked with chief and his staff to make sure we're addressing safety issues, et cetera. So I'm happy to share any details if you need it. But since I don't report on that directly myself all the time, I wanted to see that they did address that a little bit in the monthly report, and there are details if you'd like it. I also just wanted to make a note for you all related to Morgan Park. I got a heads up from folks who were upset at the neighborhood meeting regarding information and what that was supposed to look like and stuff like that. So I'm anticipating the first ward meeting. We'll have some of those folks speaking to us. I would really like to know more details about what those concerns were specifically so I know going into a first ward meeting, and Alderperson Murphy knows what answers we've gotten before we show up there. I will have the city engineer provide that information to you. Yeah, because it was limited to very specific area, very specific individuals. Got it. But not overall throughout the entire project area. Okay. And that's all I have on that. Yes. And actually, I had the same question for the city engineer, and he called me and explained, which is one resident that actually had reached out to me early on, and they're looking at a better solution now. It affects the second war, too. That's where we both split that. Thank you. That's all I have. Anything further on that item? Hearing? None. We move to Moline Fire department. Finally. Chief, come on up. Chief Fire Officer designation. Fire Chief Steve Braggenweather. That's good. So anyhow, let me just read to you from the center for Public Safety Excellence. The news release dated April 4, and it reads as follows. Moline Fire Chief completes international professional designation process Mulane Fire Chief Stephen G. Regenweather has successfully completed the process that awards the professional designation of chief fire officer, CFO. The Commission on Professional Credential met on March 15, 2024 to confer the designation. Chief Reaganweather becomes one of only 1899 chief fire officials worldwide and the first chief fire official designated for the city of Mullein. Think about how long we've been around. He's the first, so congratulations being number one. The designation program is a voluntary program designed to recognize individuals who demonstrate their excellence in seven measured components, including experience, education, professional development, professional contributions, association membership, community involvement, and technical competence. In addition, all applicants are required to identify a future professional development plan. The CFO designation program uses a comprehensive peer review model to evaluate candidates seeking the credential. The Commission on Professional Credentialing awards the designation only after an individual successfully meets all the organization's stringent criteria. Achieving this designation signifies Chief Ragenweather's career commitment to the fire and emergency services. The designation is valid for three years and in maintaining that designation, requires the fire chief to show continued growth in areas of professional development, professional contributions, active association membership, and community involvement, as well as to adhere to a strict code of professional conduct. Congratulations. And he's wearing the pin, so congratulations. As I said this morning, I'm just glad that folks speaking wasn't one of the criteria, Bob, for those kind words and the recognition. Achieving something like this is made a lot easier with working for a council like you. Achievements, you know, are viewed, and those aren't possible if I don't have the support from you. So thank you very much. Congratulations. We are proud of you. All right, I will close out our committee of the whole and call our regular council meeting to order. Pledge of Allegiance, please.

Thank you again to elder person Rizak for leading the last meeting of March. We certainly have a lot of things going on. Staff is working diligently on all sorts of things, especially some of the new strategic objectives from our strategic plan. I did want to just note publicly the letter that I've passed out to you that was mailed on April 1 to Unity point health. I want you to know, as chief said, we have been talking, including older person Timian and a working group on mental health issues. We have been talking for over a year about possible solutions, everything from the input side when it comes to practitioners who work in this field, to bump up the number of those working here in the Quad Cities, to economic development. Do we need more competition in terms of providers in the area? But I think we've reached a point where I couldn't stay silent anymore. I want you to know what I've said, and I want you to know that I'm following up. I do have a meeting at the request of unity point about something else scheduled next Friday, the 19th. But I will for sure be bringing this up with their regional representative. And I do. If you can indulge me, please, I'm going to read this out loud for the public record. This is to doctor Toyosi Olutade, chief medical director Dan Sterner, emergency director Dennis Duke, president of Robert Young center. The hospital system plays an important role in our community health. Community's healthcare. We expect hospitals to provide primary and trauma services and care for the indigent. Our hospitals are a vital component to maintaining the healthcare safety net. I've worked closely with Chief Darren Gault and our police department to understand the challenges and community needs when it comes to addressing the mental health crisis. It has come to my attention over the past few years that the services for emergency mental health treatment are not meeting our expectations. Patients our community deserves better emergency treatment for mental health care. In fact, the state of Illinois legislature has made it clear that they expect patients experiencing mental health crises to receive equivalent care to those experiencing physical emergencies. In April 2021, a 44 year old male was displaying psychotic behavior and was transported to unity point emergency department and was never treated. He walked out of the emergency room lobby. Two days later, the Mullein police department was faced with a situation with this same individual where they almost had to use deadly force. In May 2022, a 23 year old male was transported to Unity Point emergency department for mental health and drug treatment. The patient was transported by ambulance.

The City of Moline has invested in programs to improve response to mental health crisis. We have entered into a partnership with the center for Youth and Family Solutions to have social workers embedded with our police department. We have provided funding to the police department each of the last two years to increase or expand our social work programs. We have increased funding for training for our police department, including scenario based training. We are evaluating the need for increased EMS services in our fire department to address the increased cost volume largely revolving around the drug and mental health crisis. Now it is time for the hospital to do its part. All of this will be for naught if the public hospital system does not improve their mental health emergency treatment. As you can see just from these few examples above, our police and ambulance services are taking patients for treatment, but in these cases, the system failed. I would like to meet with hospital executives to determine how the hospital intends to improve its response to mental health crisis crises. Our citizens have no other choice but to seek unitypoint services for mental health care. I do understand the significant economic pressures that health systems face. This reality, however, should not determine the care with which your hospital staff treat human beings. Our region is not ripe with options, and our hospital system is set up for Rock island to be the primary entry point for moline citizens to seek such care. It is imperative that our community can rely on your local hospital system to maintain the healthcare safety net. So that is the extent of the communication at this point. You know, Illinois municipal code tells mayors they're responsible for the health, safety and welfare of their community, and that's the spirit in which I wrote that letter. So there'll be more follow up, I'm sure, but thank you for listening through that and having it in your possession. So you know the common language that and issues that chief and I are talking about. Any questions? Comments? All right, this is something very unfortunate. This needs to be addressed with care. One of the issues that, I don't know if you're aware, but they're currently staffing emergency rooms with a high percentage of visiting doctors and nurses experienced that, even with my own elderly family member. Lack of care, being sent home with pain medication with no instructions on it or in her possession. So this not unique, I probably to just that particular hospital, but an issue we have just simply because it's the labor market and the economics of hospital care are increasingly difficult. So, Miss Murphy, do you have anything? No. No, your honor. No, mister Timian. Thank you, your honor. I had the pleasure yesterday of talking to some public works employees as they were working on sidewalks in my neighborhood. And every single time I talked to them, I learned something new about concrete or road construction. And it's just. It's a great time. So I wanted to thank them for all the work they're doing. It's. I've had plenty of residents comment on it, and everyone's really excited about it. It's long overdue, and it's well deserved for the community to receive a little bit of attention. So, thank you. Nothing, your honor. Mister Schmidt. Right. Mister Vitas. Nothing. You're on. Okay. I took up everyone's time. Don't forget tomorrow. Also, by the way, there is an infrastructure, like all day workshop. No, not tomorrow. Thursday. Thursday. Where every city is giving former secretary Ray Lahood. Ray lahood. A key to the city as a portion of the event. So, just so you know, we'll be represented at that. And then how many people are able to come to the par instrument groundbreaking? I do what's called a couple of us. It's on Friday. I don't remember what time. I think I should be. Okay. We'll have a good representation. I can resend the invitation as a reminder tomorrow if you'd like. Okay, sounds good. I'm gonna send. Thank you. Is there any further public comment this evening? No. Okay.

I want to give fair warning that I cut my teeth for the city doing water main break repairs. So I detest cold weather. So in honor of this warm humidifier repair, I've had David substitute the extended version of this. So. Okay, so we're going to talk tonight about the regulatory environment that we're working in relating to these bloodlines. We're going to talk about where we are now as more with regard to these requirements, and then we'll finish off with some options relating to how we want to proceed. And really, since there's no action that we're seeking here tonight, there'll be no vote or anything, but we are looking for some direction or some concurrence on the ideas that we are presenting. So this slide represents the map of Moline and where the lead lines exist within the city and within the boundaries. This is a map of the census tracts, not necessarily the. The alder person wards, but you can see, I think there's the. There was the idea, when I've met with some of you, that the predominance of the web lines exist over on the west side of town and maybe especially the northwest side of town, but in reality, they're spread throughout. And so you'll see, as we get into the presentation that we're seeking state revolving loan funds for to fund this. We think that that's the best option. Before I get going too far, I want to let you know that I've brought with me a couple of experts, and that is Brown. He's our environmental compliance manager. He's the one on our team that knows the most about the lead and copper rule and the lead and copper rule revision. So that will be in place later on this year. And then also Levi Jackson. He's the one that dutifully worked last evening until midnight to work on the repair of the water main on 40th street. That gives them a better view of the screen. Thanks. How's that? All right. Okay. Thank you, mayor. Thank you, Alder Persons, for being here tonight to find out what this is all about after all these years of it being installed into the strategic plan of the city going back to our 2021 with one of the ideas that I threw out there for several months because I realized we happen to have a lot of farmland south of the city and no growth. There's no growth, but we owned a lot of property. And versus what are we doing with it? Not much. So the question is what to do with that land. And this idea was that's how we got worth it. And so let's go to the next slide. So why would we want to do something like this? What's the purpose? Well, first of all, you know, we own this parcel of land, which you're going to see, and we've owned it since 2006 and it has been basically underutilized other than for agriculture production the entire time. That's what it's used for inverter. And then it's converted and goes into, into the service panel and then there's some conversions that happen and gone into the utility period. What are the benefits? New revenue source. Right. We're always looking for alternate revenue sources. Right, folks? Only so many of them out there. Municipalities have to struggle annually with unfunded mandates from the state or unfunded federal mandates. Lead lines is a great example, but a health issue. Right. So we're always looking for revenue. This is a revenue generator, as you're going to learn tonight. We can use it to generate power on site. We can actually sell that power. We can actually reduce our costs with that power. And we're looking at a couple alternatives. And again, we're going to be looking, general guidance from council because we're at this level right now and we're drilling down, none of us are solar experts, right. But quickly we're becoming solar knowledgeable. The best way to describe it every day, actually. So as we, as we look at this, I mean, we look at spreading that saving. So we generate, and you're going to see we generate about, I think it was almost, nearly a million dollars a year in cost, use about 13 kilovolts what it is. And it cost us almost a million dollars. Imagine if you didn't have to pay that money, it's a million dollar ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "City of Moline", "insights": [{"observation": "Regulatory environment relating to the replacement of lead service lines within the city.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "State revolving loan funds sought to fund lead service line replacement.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Lead lines exist throughout the city, not just on the northwest side.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "City is working under lead and copper rule revision that will be implemented later this year.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Ownership of farmland since 2006 has been underutilized other than for agriculture production.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Proposal to use owned land for solar power generation as a new revenue source and cost-saving measure.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Potential to sell generated solar power and reduce city\u2019s costs.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Municipalities' struggle with unfunded mandates from the state or federal government.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "General guidance sought from council regarding solar power alternatives.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "esg_v2": [{"name": "City of Moline", "insights": [{"observation": "Regulatory environment relating to the replacement of lead service lines within the city.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "State revolving loan funds sought to fund lead service line replacement.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Lead lines exist throughout the city, not just on the northwest side.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "City is working under lead and copper rule revision that will be implemented later this year.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Ownership of farmland since 2006 has been underutilized other than for agriculture production.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "Proposal to use owned land for solar power generation as a new revenue source and cost-saving measure.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Potential to sell generated solar power and reduce city\u2019s costs.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Municipalities' struggle with unfunded mandates from the state or federal government.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"observation": "General guidance sought from council regarding solar power alternatives.", "classification": "G", "sentiment": "positive"}]}], "chunk_start_time": 200, "chunk_end_time": 400300, "base_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeNKlLUm3I", "chunk_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeNKlLUm3I&t=0s"}, {"start": 4000, "end": 10000, "text": "y with unfunded mandates from the state or unfunded federal mandates.

So not by that, great jobs, obviously great jobs to not only build it, but it'll create jobs to manage it and operated. So, and also, of course, you're going to see as we go through this, opens up other doors for economic development. Nobody around us is James State Solar. You want to go through this a little bit, by the way, changes, I think significant to know is the 47% decrease in costs for implementing solar over the past ten years. That's a very significant decrease in the upfront costs, making it more appealing and more able to utilize for, you know, doesn't want to go that far. But if you see on the far graph on the bottom, on the right, on the top blue section, that is utility scale growth. And that's what we're looking at doing, is a utility scale level solar development. So you see a lot of growth in that blue section over the past three to four years. And this is Illinois specific. So right now we're ranked 15. It's amazing. We went from nothing, from nothing. Being ranked 15th, that's pretty impressive. Even the folks who spoke to on the phone today from Washington, DC know what's going on in Illinois when it comes to solar. Illinois climate bank is putting a lot of effort and funding into clean energy in Illinois, which is, I think, coming under Illinois finance Authority. It's a subsection of Illinois finance. So a couple different ways. I mean, we are looking at a direct ownership model right now. At least that's what we were thinking about from the get go. That's still where we are today. But one of the things we're going to want to do, of course, is evaluate what is the best model for the city. You know, is it where we own it, we operate it, we sell that boost to the power company, we offset all of our costs. Right. And we get all the benefits and we get 100% of benefit. Again, 100% of risk. Yeah, 100% of the risk. Whatever that risk is, we get it. Or you enter into public private partnerships. There's companies out there all across the United States that actually partner with government agencies or school districts or local governments, and they go in and they create public private partnerships. They share in the cost burden. We get a piece of the puzzle, but then they get their piece because they're heavily investing into it as well. Our investment, of course, initially is that underlying land has a tremendous value. We paid about a million dollars for that land. Just to give an idea, about 975. Long time ago, 2006. Yeah. Okay. Federal funding sources you want to talk about inflation reduction, actual energy. Okay. So up until actually this year, the tax credits that were available under the Inflation Reduction act were not available to at all, or nonprofits only for private organizations. So now that that has changed, it's called direct pay. And that program is now it's a straight up cash rebate on investment in the energy. And right now it's ranging anywhere from 30% to 50%, depending on certain criteria. As Tony mentioned about the census tracts, a similar kind of denotation from the. From the federal government is to help. They have this justice 40 initiative. So they're wanting 40% of all federal funds invested to go towards, you know, low income households. Yeah. So depending on, you know, our structure of the project, it could be up to 50. We're guessing a minimum of 30 though. No matter what, what you decide to do, as far as funding, you should be able to get at least 30. So that's, it's a special 990 form that's filed since, you know, governments don't pay taxes. It's a special form that you get and it's a direct cash payment act on your investment. It's a very, very good incentive. Very lucrative right now. Right now it's lucrative. We don't know what 25 is beyond. Just going to lay that on the table. That is a concern that's out there. What's going to happen with all these programs going into 25 and beyond? For right now, these are the programs that are available. Will be around for a while. Also said that there was possibly some bridge loans available coming this summer. Those have not been previously available before either. And that would kind of help the upfront capital investment costs to help with that financing up front. That's great. Then we got the build on my bond fund. That's what bond issuance from DCEO Farms Economic opportunity, the National Investment Fund through the EPA building resilient infrastructure communities, brick grant through FEMA, and then the Illinois Climate bank. As you recall, we recently adopted an ordinance relative to the climate bank. So there's a real opportunity here to tap a lot of different resources. Which ones we tap are really dependent upon which model we use. We know what we would like. We know potential benefit questions, what scenario works best and what does the city council, who's going to vent the most? Right? Everybody needs to ", "esg_v1": [{"name": "James State Solar", "insights": [{"observation": "We can use it to generate power on site. We can actually sell that power.

Those have not been previously available before either. And that would kind of help the upfront capital investment costs to help with that financing up front. That's great. Then we got the build on my bond fund. That's what bond issuance from DCEO Farms Economic opportunity, the National Investment Fund through the EPA building resilient infrastructure communities, brick grant through FEMA, and then the Illinois Climate bank. As you recall, we recently adopted an ordinance relative to the climate bank. So there's a real opportunity here to tap a lot of different resources. Which ones we tap are really dependent upon which model we use. We know what we would like. We know potential benefit questions, what scenario works best and what does the city council, who's going to vent the most? Right? Everybody needs to get something. Okay. Short of all those funding programs, you know, there's always going to be a gap, you know, municipal bonds, obviously we have that capacity to do what we need to when we need to. It's unlimited because we are. Home rule counsel determines what is appropriate. The last time we issued bonds since I've been here, I believe was the police pension obligation bonds, I'm not mistaken. Yes. Right. And that was a screaming success. We did really well in the bond market, and that's what, you know, for a budget time. But you can see that's, that's one option as well. That's just a point of reference for you, what we have out there. Anything else you want, any questions on that at all? Okay, then. Upfront capital, that's okay. Upfront capital divided by parties. We're going to talk about something unique as well. And that's going to. The next slide is looking at potential partners. Who else, if we're going to build something of this size, who else could benefit by its development and offset their cost as well to bring down tax levies or to redistribute spending, total tax levies in place. Because remember, we're competing not only with our neighbors locally, but regionally, both in Illinois and across the river, not just Iowa. You're competing with. You're competing with everybody around us. So, example, Moline, coal Valley School District, we had some just very general conversations with them. And school districts around the country are actually eligible for different programs as well. And they are pursuing these programs because they're looking for ways to bring their costs down. So as you take a look at it, squinting a little bit, I can see the 13.35 up in the right corner. That's the city's use, 13.35 gigawatt hours annually based on 2023. And then the school district down below 9.20 for 2023. So a total of 22.55 gigawatt hours annually. 2 million and change. That's really what it is. It's 2 million and change. That leaves basically nine gigawatt hours annually left available to even explore other, one of the more unique things. We can either keep it or we can spread it. Right? Because remember, as you drop those tax levies and those property taxes fall, people have more money to spend on other things. Bottom line also makes living here more attractive. Might help induce development. So that's one of the things that's important. Metrolink is out there. Major energy user, probably. We haven't had a conversation with Jeff Nelson yet, but he would jump all over and he could find a way to get rid of his energy bill, right. Electric buses. Electric bills. Bus international airport. Talk to Ben Leishner will find out what Ben's thinking. If there's an interest from council, the vibrant arena or the Quad City Civic center authority, obviously that's a big building, cost a lot of money to run it, but looking for our taxing entities and have a really, truly unique funding. Right. And it helps spread that cost to fill that cap because as you're going to learn from Donald, the payback is pretty quick. So question, are those numbers based on all three sections being built out or just all three? All three. The 31.2. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Do the power companies buy back some of that power as well? Yes, that's why we're meeting with mid American. As you're going to see. We want to define that role in that relationship. We're trying to find out where they've done something similar to this and they're saying it's proprietary. So we're going to meet with them and we're going to dig a little bit deeper and we're going to roll that idea back. We want to see where they're doing it, how they're doing it before they've done it, and maybe they're not, I don't know. But I'm guessing they represent a lot of territory in Iowa. So there's got to be some farm tools out there with solar, not all wind. So basically we're going to meet with them on Friday. We're going to get into the discussion about what you will at here in terms of they do play a crucial role because how do we get that power off that they do play a role. So we'll talk to them as well. That's like alternate land uses. And this really excites dawn. I'm going to let her try and excites the mayor. This is really fun stuff now because we talked about solar farm, but then we dug deep. Like I said, we're not experts. And then we got into what are known as agrivoltaics. So you end up with your solar up above and you end up with these things, dogs. And this is very popular, by the way, extremely popular. And they are leading edge on this stuff. It's still up and coming in the US. So it would be leading edge type of endeavor for sure. So here's some different ideas that we're kind of thinking about discussing internally. Pollinator habitat. I'm a huge fan of pollinators personally. So I was excited, very excited, actually. All of these are wonderful ways to use the land and, you know, kind of maximize the use of farmland. Right.

I'm a huge fan of pollinators personally. So I was excited, very excited, actually. All of these are wonderful ways to use the land and, you know, kind of maximize the use of farmland. Right. You know, you're getting this solar energy and you're able to do that, but also able to still utilize that farmland. And the pollinator habitat would really help soil health and restore the soil from many, many years of it being row cropped. That would, you know, benefit future generations and obviously look pretty. The lavender farming is something that Bob has brought to our attention, which I've done some research now, and I feel like it is a viable option. I personally do have lavender of my yard, and I think, you know, in my research, it's kind of come up. You know, it is a great beginner kind of farming. It's very kind of easy to implement. It's a perennial crop, so you don't have to plant it every year. So, you know, he's selling me on it. I got him going. It took a little doing, but, yeah, I mean, a property like ours, just on an average production on that much land is probably anywhere from as little as a million dollars to as much as $3 million or more in terms of value. When you raise the lavender and you sell, there's a very strong market for lavender, which is interesting and that difficult to kind of harvest. It seems like, you know, viable opportunity to make some additional money. And really you could honestly combine all three into the project. It is 100 acres, you know, the adding in, I mean, not in the same rows as combined, but you could have different sections almost. And having that kind of diversity on site would also help pollinators and just to keep them reversible. So the third option I kind of came across in doing more research about on the agrivoltaics that, you know, different cities or Europe. In Europe, there's some great examples of using community agriculture, and there's some crops that grow wonderfully under the panels, and there's some research supporting that. Lettuces, broccoli, tomatoes, asparagus, raspberries, as well as sheep seem to do well with solar panels. They're not aggressive, and they can kind of graze the land. So a lot of options out there that I find extremely exciting. So we can go back here. I got some kind of pluses on each of them. But again, I think a combination could also be incorporated. It almost becomes educational when you think about it, when you think about our local schools, programs that are here, think about what gear really is all about feeding the world. I mean, that's their motto. They may take a great interest in this project. So, you know, something like this is truly, truly unique. The farm bureau would as well, there's a lot of potential for a public private partnership with farmers small operating. And there's a tremendous, as we've learned today in our conversations with the ICMA, which is the international Student Association, I came across a webinar that we're both going to participate in and found the person from ICMA actually on the panel. So we reached out to them, did a lot of research across the boards on services they provide. They've been at this for ten years with solar, and they've got all kind of like technical assistance they can provide, which is good, and it's free. It's not going to replace what electrical engineers are doing. That's not at all what they do, but like the models and what works best, that kind of approach, they can do that. So we're going to look at. We're going to look at that as well. We've got a $450,000 allocation from Greg Johnson's funds down and down in Springfield. That would be a DCEO grant. There's no match to that grant. It's in the budget. We know that just the same way the money is in the budget for tax, not tax, that are going to be vibrant arena. And we just got to wait to see whether they issue capital buys. Paytag. That's what we're waiting. We're pushing them and pushing them all the time. But that would then allow us to actually launch this project and retain a consultant to work with us to do what is the high level design that has to happen, which we're going to see now is going to be the preliminary work with the real, real heavy lift comes next. So this kind of shows you where we're at. Don did some preliminary design work and came up with some costs associated with the project and project feasibility. And it was all done for a bono. Thank you, Kara. Thank you for that. And here we are. This is where we're at today. We're gonna kind of go through what the next steps are. And hopefully, if you're still interested in solar, this project will become solar energy. Right. That's our goal with that. That's our last slide. It is. There you go. Thank you.

Good evening, everybody. It's a pleasure to be here. I just want to thank you for this opportunity to talk about this amazing, transformative project. I'm here to expand upon what Bob and Dawn previously said about this Moline solar project. I'm Don Prieston. I am the director of electrical engineering. I've got 25 years plus of electrical engineering experience. Prior to that, I was in the nuclear navy as a nuclear engineer on submarines. Did that for six years. I'm licensed in 36 states, and my subject matter expertise is sustainable power solutions and local power. Tara. Just a little bit about Tara. So, Tara, we have. We're a multi disciplinary engineering firm. We have 30 years of experience. We were founded back in 1992. We have five offices. Our headquarters is in Chicago. However, we do have a major office just down the road in Peoria. Our company is a certified woman owned business enterprise, and we have greater than hundreds and hundreds employees. Our focus is on partnership and collaboration. So we wouldn't be just a vendor to millennium. We would be a partner and work with you as a partner. Our company has electrical engineering site, civil engineering, transportation engineering, structural construction, engineering, landscape architecture, water resources, and survey services as well. So all the disciplines that would be necessary for a solar farm as far as total municipal usage is concerned. I'll go back up a little bit. So, back in February, our company had a meeting with Bob, and during that time, he informed us of the city's initiative to construct a solar farm on a really nice parcel of land. And we told Bob that we can do a quick helioscope analysis to do a conceptual solar farm layout with preliminary yield and shading and financial analysis associated with that overall analysis. The property. The property is actually located here at the northwest corner of 72nd street and 100th Avenue south of the Quad Cities International Airport. As previously discussed, it's on approximately 100 acres of land. You know, so this property seems ideal for a solar farm like this. Given the fact that the land use is fairly flat, it would require minimal grading, thus minimizing the cost for or site work. Plus, it's fairly clear on the southern exposure, which is key for a silicon project in the northern hemisphere, and it's close to overhead lines or power lines, so that's going to minimize the cost for utility tie ins. For this project, we use helioscope for the conceptual design of the solar farm. Helioscope is a user friendly software which we use to lay out solar modules, provide us a yield and shading analysis, and provide us a better understanding of key financial metrics, such as the upfront cost, payback, and future revenue generated through its end of life. The solar design features are listed here. 41,590 solar modules. That's about 575 watts per module, 189 inverters, equaling a total size of 23.5 mw. DC manual production is 31.23 gigawatt hours. The modules will be mounted on fixed tilt racking facing due south on a 33 degree tilt. The modules will be stacked in a landscape orientation two by five. On racks. There will be ten foot rows allocating space for maintenance vehicles to clean modules on regular intervals. North, south, right, right down in that orange line, right down the solar farm, you'll see an access road for fire protection vehicles and utility interconnection equipment. And then we will specify american made equipment that comply with buy America act. Our generated layout is extremely efficient. Our calculated shading losses are less than 5%. The solar standard is less than 10%. The recommended ground coverage coverage ratio is, you know, between 0.5 and point. I'm sorry, 0.4 and 0.5. Ours is 0.43. And then plus the over the average total solar resource fraction is almost 96% out of a minimum recommended 75%. So it's an extremely efficient layout. I will note that the standard end of life is listed at 25 years. However, like Bob said, we can extend that. The solar modules are actually listed at 30 years, and it's quite common that that can actually be operated up to 40 years, so resulting in, obviously, higher revenue going to back up. Just a couple slides here. So, total municipal usage. Dawn temple. She worked with the finance department to compile a list of municipal loads, including the municipal buildings, including city hall, fire stations, police stations, etcetera, parks and utilities, and then the traffic lights and signals. The overall municipal usage is combined 13.35 gigawatt hours. Also, as Don included earlier, the school districts equate about 9.2 gigawatt hours. So, next, I would like to discuss the preliminary financial analysis. According to Helioscope, the upfront system cost will be approximately 64 million, which falls in line with the industry standard of it is calculated. It is calculated a 8.8 year payback, considering modest funding. However, I'm sorry, the overall cumulative cash flow at the end of life is greater than $111 billion. If we are successful in achieving full potential funding that's available, the payback period will likely go down, and the cumulative cost will actually go up higher than what's shown there. There are approximately $25 m", "esg_v1": [{"name": "Terra Engineering", "insights": [{"observation": "Hopefully, if you're still interested in solar, this project will become solar energy.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Moline solar project.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "Our company is a certified woman owned business enterprise.", "classification": "S", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "We told Bob that we can do a quick helioscope analysis to do a conceptual solar farm layout with preliminary yield and shading and financial analysis associated with that overall analysis.", "classification": "E", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"observation": "The property is actually located here at the northwest corner of 72nd street and 100th Avenue south of the Quad Cities International Airport.

It is calculated a 8.8 year payback, considering modest funding. However, I'm sorry, the overall cumulative cash flow at the end of life is greater than $111 billion. If we are successful in achieving full potential funding that's available, the payback period will likely go down, and the cumulative cost will actually go up higher than what's shown there. There are approximately $25 million or more available funding through the award of state and federal grants and rebates. And some of those available financial incentives were previously discussed. Some other ones are listed here. The Illinois solar for all Justice 40. Siege of Community Solar sovereignty grants, equitable energy Futures grant, IRA tax credits, and then building resilience infrastructure and community grants some potential community benefits. So there are many potential benefits which can result in the construction of the solar farm. Some of those benefits include lower utility costs for municipal buildings. Money saved on utility costs can be redirected to benefit potential lower taxes for constituents due to lower municipal expenditures. Population growth solar generation surplus can be offered to lower residents for community sources subscriptions we may be able to offer surplus plus benefits to the school districts, which again, they use about 9.2 gigawatt hours and other key community transit authorities. You know, it's discussed in Metrolink and the local airport. We can reduce the overall carbon footprint and then additional revenue generation opportunities like the lavender production farms in between the solar rows. So what's next? So if the city council is interested in moving towards Terra, can set a proposal for detailed construction design, solar analysis and application assistance. You know, once the city approves our proposal and sends us a contract, we will detailed construction design and financial analysis to support the application process as early as may. We will help, you know, assist in the utility coordination. Utility coordination is a little bit of wild card for all these projects and we assist in that process. We will provide bid and construction documentation if the city prefers. We can also provide intermittent review cycles before we get to the full bid and construction documents. When the bid documents are ready, the city can advertise the project to contractors for bidding. You know, it is key for the silicone projects that contractors are NAFSA certified and that's one the city will award to the winning contractor and the solar farm is constructed. It is recommended that the city continues to engage with terra engineering for construction administration and observation services during the construction so that we can answer any questions generated by the contractors, review vendor drawings and observe site visits and ensure compliance with the contract documents. After the solar farm is constructed, the contractors, vendors, engineers, city utility and utility will commission the solar farm, which is estimated place in 2025. I will also say that arc staff, although I'm not a grant rebate expert, our staff does have experts available to assist dawn and the staff here for that process. It is a pretty detailed process that takes a lot of time and we're available to us at some. With that being said, any questions? Quite a few. The diminished energy returns just because panels lose efficiency over time, is this also factoring in damage panels needs for replacement? We have tornadoes. Yeah, that's going to be a problem. Is there insurance that goes along with that? Or this? You know, if you could take out half of the array with the right storage, so is there, is this factored into either the models or do we have contingencies? Last question. This would require city workers to maintain it, is that correct? And what's the budget for that? You guys can answer but I believe the idea was we hadn't chosen how much was municipal owned by the operation. Those questions relate to that analysis. Would we want to be the owner operator, public private partners with a private company? It's not going to advertise for anybody, but they're all over. I talked to at least one or two of them already. You know, they come in, they build it on your land and you get a piece of it. They take the lion's share obviously they take the line share because they don't take about risk. So. And there would be a sharps because they. And answer your folks questioning diminishing returns in the very details. Financial analysis was not in this model. We have additional software that does model that out. It's actually going to be necessary for some of the funding applications. This was a very quick renewal analysis that just gives us an idea of a financial. So the kilowatt hours going down every year isn't due to diminished production? Yeah, there will be over time. There will be some modules that fail. There will be some inverters that will need to be replaced. There's going to be some soiling that takes place. There's going to be utility. It's like water replaced. One of the estimate wasn't about 4.5 in annual revenue. Replaces ARPA Dallas folks, which are going to be gone December of 25 and then you're not going to be able to.

We had our conversation with the director of the clean energy programs at ICMA and we asked a lot of the questions you were asking and got the same kind of answers. It's all over the place. Everybody's kind of like exploring the different alternatives. This new thing, this direct pay program, that's what the webinar is about because local governments, county governments, school districts couldn't do that before, but now we have the ability to do it. So nobody, you know, we're braving new territory is the best way to describe it how she described it. So we need to have some guidance. Gotcha. My question was the same of employees. Let me see. They would all be union if they were sitting at employees. Thank you, your honor. One question and then a comment what kind of regulatory or I guess pushback have you gotten from the energy industry? Or are they seeing it as an opportunity for them to buy energy without them? It's a huge job of being all the major utilities. You know, I attended seminars with Ann Marin and come at their racing this new sustainable power. They really are. They know that there's a heavy push to decommission the cfgs and coal plants and they have to supplement that somehow. So they see this as an opportunity. This and wind farms. Okay, thank you. And then just my comment when we first were putting together the grandmaster plan, I remember, and it was relatively new solar, just to save on our buildings, put them on the rooftops. So just the fact that, you know, you've looked into this, where we're at with this, to me, and I'm not the most environmental guy in the world, but this excites me on that aspect. I love the fact that even having flowers or vegetation, there is another nice piece. And if we don't have a city flower, it'd be mine. Thank you. So I'm very much supportive of us and recognizing this is a little bit of a new piece or an opportunity. That's what I want to poke the fair on just a little bit. How is this any different than if the city just decided to open a business as a self sustaining public service, to be sure. But yeah, I mean, I know that we say we're going to produce enough energy to cover our own use it. That's a shell game. We are literally producing the energy that gets put into the utility and then they offset it in how it gets reported. But we're not physically providing our energy the way we provide. We're not pushing that energy out to the municipal buildings. We're pushing it into the grid. Right. We're pushing it into the grid to deploy the equipment. Unless you own your own electric utility company utilities. But this is really no different than that. But it's even sold. But it still is, essentially. And I'm not saying I'm opposed to this, it's just as it lays out, it is us opening a business, granted, one that is related to a utility. And utilities are highly regulated, even though they're businesses. I guess that's how it's part of a highly regulated industry that has been historically public as well. I would envision that if we were to go forward with this project, the solar utility itself would be a part of our utility employees who out there, which is basically low level maintenance, really. It's not like daily maintenance but any of the, like the cleaning of the panels themselves, there's equipment for that. It's all automated. Share with us that model machine, whatever it's called. Quite interesting. It's like a car wash on an arm, kind of watching the panels. But I would envision. Yeah, that's what I wanted to jump in and say as a cautious council, to think too far down the road. This is the meeting that tells us this is really possible here on this piece of land. And there's a lot more information that has to be gathered and has to be decided upon, especially given the multiple ways we could form this. Public private partnerships are always, well, I should be careful what word I use, but generally a really great way to go. I'm not saying I'm anti municipal utilities. Obviously we have a great track record with our water provision, et cetera, but I think we can't get too far down the road with this at this time. I wanted to add that I was. I think it is time for this part of the state to have something like this. If you look at that map, dawn put up with the Illinois, it's way in the beginning of her presentation. There's nothing but something in Navy Savannah Ardalena. Like, that's ridiculous. That is absolutely ridiculous. If we have the ability to do this and to make it balance out on the balance sheets and really impact our residents and our bottom line, then I don't know why we wouldn't do it. Well, maybe even the region, too, right?

Maybe Coal Valley thinks it's a great idea. But in this case, we can make a very good case for the state of Illinois investing in us, because they're doing it every place else. And I've been having these conversations with the CEO at multiple levels about what do you want to do up here? This seems like the write up. So you broke this into three sections. I'm wondering if that was intentional, because it sounds like we're proposing to do all at once because of the uncertainty of 2025 future funding. So is that accurate software that we use? It does have design limitations you can design. So we have great benefits only for the reporting of this section size. For the more detailed analysis, we also use a software called, which provides that. But helioscope is a better software that actually lay out the module shading analysis. So the financial analysis would be something that cash flow the first year is that anticipated trigger consensus because we go from zero or negative cash flow to 6 million, right? That's right. Let's anticipate that's modest blending, right. That was just modest funding. There's an opportunity to actually greater funding. You got to reduce the payback period that made it 25%. So I mean the payback return investments. So I understand that we don't know yet what the municipal model looks like. Who would be another big player? Is it universities, solar farms that we could look to just to. So locally, I'm not sure what is being done here locally, I don't think anything. But maybe across the state there's a 1300 acre solar farm being put in by Cordova that just was approved by the county. And so I'm trying to find out more information about that. I guess that's some part of the state that's not all that. It just got approved. So I am going to try to see if I can find out. Universities are a prime example of large entities that are responsible for my own institution is trying to put it on the buildings. New revenue is new revenue. And with this many benefits, I don't know why you go posting ahead, but even large industrials, even large industrials are, you know, they've got a heavy drive for, you know, that's zero initiatives by 2050. You know, so you know, even though industrials are done examples of it. I mean airports had sold over. Yeah, when you have like doesn't interfere with airports as well, which is really important now. Tiff seven, I mean it's never been developed well, I just be a great use for that one. And I'm not running east plain, but you got a thousand acres in solar. So I do think peace building study understand that this is reporting about over 25 years, $47 million coming back. Obviously some of that's going to go expensive. I think there's going to be a significant portion of that left. My inclination, given all of that is, and in part reflecting on in that business piece, it is. It's such a highly regulated state entity, even though it's been run as a business, it really isn't, which makes it safer for us to go into and what a lot of things probably do. But my implementation is to say we go in on our own. I understand the value of going in with the other organizations as far as how that splits and to some of the other government entities I hesitate to go to private piece of that puzzle. I mean depending on what the deal is and what the feasibility is piece comes back with. I just think we're doing it to create that long term benefit back. This is one of those places where with some investment and confirming for the feasibility study a low risk, it just can help us to establish that long term opportunity. I just. I think that's where we should. That is where my preference would be. Depending, of course, how the future and how that plays out. The other part of that is clearly, you know, being good partners is wonderful, the ways we can be at that. But if we are looking at a fast timeline because we want to take advantage of what is out there, then it's probably better to just put it together as if we are the only entity and then go back and establish the part. And I like the comment about it running in that same sort of way because it would have to be a solar. Yeah. I just wanted to also point out in the islands like Puerto Rico and Hawaii that gave hurricanes, they're really investing in this individuals, the credit union world. They're really doing a lot of work working with individuals so they could have solar on their rooftop because regularly they get their grids disrupted. And so it's a. In some places, the wind is not about. They need this on zone. So, yeah, it's all over the world that they're looking at this. And I'm glad that you show samples from Europe, too. We're not just looking here in the state, but how can we stand out, really maximize? I like the idea of maximizing as much as possible. Yeah. Drive around, see them, and everybody's out there cultivating underneath. I did have one question. The fixed version, there's no. It would increase cost to have the movables, though. That's right.

We're talking about growing things underneath the panels. I assume that these are semi translucent in nature to allow sunlight to go through. Okay. So tomatoes wouldn't work underneath.

I'll call this meeting to order at 06:00 p.m. here in council chambers. I'm going to briefly turn it over to Chief Galta with some safety information since we're under some significant watches. Yeah. So, as you all know, there's a kind of a storm that's a little bit west of us. There's a tornado watch. This is probably the strongest pulley in that area, so you're very safe in here. But we've just. If their sirens go off on the top of the building here, we'll just move to the center of the building, away from the blocks. But I don't think there's any reason for anybody to flee out of here to probably safe. Thank you so much. All right, we do have a need for remote electronic attendance. Miss Finch, I would like to make a motion to approve the remote electronic attendance of Alderperson James Patrick Smith at the committee of the whole and city council meeting May 21, 2020, 2024, due to a personal illness.

All right, our first item of business is the oath of office for promotional appointment to the rank of sergeant to Cesar Lopez, effective May 19, 2024. Thank you, your honor. I think I've said this before. This is such a fun time for me to be able to stand up here, get a chance to introduce you to officers, and certainly promote officers is another honor that I get to have. You know, over the last four or five years, it's been tough times in the police department. We've seen 45 officers depart for various different reasons, and 225 years of experience left as command staff. And our command staff starts as sergeant, lieutenant, deputy chief, and, of course, chief. So we've lost a lot of experience. We've rebuilt that experience. I've made 14 promotions, 14 out of our 20 command staff that I've promoted since I've been the police chief here. And so it's certainly my honor to add another individual to the command staff by promoting Cesar Lopez from his current role as a juvenile detective to a sergeant. So Sergeant Cesar Lopez is a seasoned law enforcement officer serving with the Moline Police Department since 2017. Throughout his distinguished career, Sergeant Lopez Lopez has served in various capacities, including patrol, officer, field training officer, a liaison to the Mullein High School as a school resource officer, and his current role as a detective in the Criminal Investigation Division juvenile unit. Cesar is also bilingual, one of our three bilingual supervisors, who I believe all three of them are here today serving our spanish speaking population. And he does that with just a wonderful smile on his face every time. He's also very involved in our homeless initiative team. He's been a part of that for several years. The crisis intervention team. A Taser instructor. He's a vital member of the department's crisis negotiation team. Crisis intervention team, juvenile investigations. Vision. So today we see several family members here. Wonderful to see the young families, too. I really enjoy seeing them and their parents and everybody are here. So his wife, Selena Lopez. Great little cute family here. His son Armani here somewhere. Cool guy. And his daughter, Mia Lopez. Yeah. He's also here with his parents, Miguel and Victoria. Sister. Sister, Sonia, mother in law, Yolanda, and sister in law, Maria. So, mayor, do me an honor and admit her. So, the oath of office. Cesar Lopez, having been duly promoted to the rank of sergeant of the police department, having been duly promoted to the rank of sergeant for the city of Moline, Illinois, do solemnly swear that I will support the constitutions of the United States. I will support the Constitution of the United States. And the state of Illinois will strictly adhere to the compiled statute of the state of Illinois. Well, strictly adheres to file ordinances and any Illinois rules of professional conduct. And any Illinois rules of professional conduct applicable to police administration. Applicable to the police administration. And that I will faithfully discharge the duties and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the rank of sergeant of the police department. According to the best of my ability. According to the best of my ability. Congratulations once again. So, as I may have mentioned in the past, the city of Moline always has a supervisor working 24 hours, seven days a week, 365 days a year. The first line supervisor is the sergeant, so we always have at least a sergeant or lieutenant working 24 hours a day. So important to have skilled professionals that are here to supervise our staff, train our staff, help them through these things.

Okay, our next item of business are board appointments, the mayor's reappointment of Jeff Adamson to the historic preservation commission for a full three year term to expire April 30, 2027. Any questions? Hearing, none. Chief, when you're ready, could you tell us if there's public comment? Let me double check. I know we have one to read from online. Okay, thank you. Go ahead, Miss Murphy. There's one public comment received via email from Kim Ellis. Hello. I am a resident in Moline. I'm concerned about roundup being sprayed in our parks this spring and summer. Is there a safer alternative that can be used in place of Roundup? Below is what I found on the Internet that is safer. Mix one gallon of white vinegar with one cup of salt and mix in a tablespoon of liquid dish soap. Also, can residents help in putting mulch down around the trees to keep the weeds down so Roundup doesn't need to be used? Thank you. I don't believe we have any questions on the agenda, so we move to our committee of the whole agenda items. Agenda item 8.1. Resolution authorizing the mayor and city clerk to execute and attest to a contract with centennial contractors of the Quad Cities, Inc. For project number 1471, Moline Public Library garden for the amount of $1,287,000. I mean, Bob. Madam Mayor, members of council, we're joined tonight, of course. Our library director, Brian Lear is here, and we are recommending approval of this contract to centennial contractors of the Quad cities and the amount specified in the agenda of $1,287,000. And with a reminder that the groundbreaking ceremonies will be May 24, 28th, at 04:00 p.m. if you can join us. Motion. Topra? Second. Thank you. Motion by Finch, seconded by Castro.

Parking prohibited at any time by adding 9th Street street on the east side from Railroad Avenue south for a distance of 110ft. Mister Vitas or Mister Dreier. This was a request that was made by a new property owner who had redeveloped some of the property there on the east side. It was reviewed by the traffic engineering committee. And he's having difficulty getting equipment in and out of the garage there. With vehicles parked on that side of the street. So the recommendation of the committee was to extend the no parking restriction. Thank you so much. Motion to approve. Second motion by Finch. Seconded by Timian. Discussion hearing, none. Roll call, please. Alderperson. Timian, aye. Finch, aye. McNeil. Aye. Castro, Schmidt, aye. Murphy? Aye. Masias? Aye. Rezaq, aye. All right, that motion passes. Item 8.3. An ordinance amending chapter 20. Motor vehicles and traffic of the molling code of ordinances, appendix ten thereof. Parking prohibited at any time by adding 13th street on the east side. At the 11th Avenue intersection for a distance of 78.5ft. Mister Dreyer, this was another item brought up to us by resident in the neighborhood. It's a t intersection in an older section of the city where the streets are pretty narrow. 13th street is about 19ft wide. So with people parking very close to the intersection and across the top of the t access issues were being found to be problematic. So we reviewed that too with the traffic engineering committee. And recommended installation, installing some parking restrictions at the intersection. Thank you. Motion to approve second motion by Finch. Seconded by Razak. Discussion hearing, none. Roll call, please. Alderperson. Simeon. Aye. Finch? Aye. McNeil, aye. Castro, aye. Schmidt, aye. Murphy, aye. Macias? Aye. Rezaq, aye.

Appendix Q, entitled Avenue of the city's corridor plan. Future use map incorporated therein as a portion of zone four. Page eleven. Southwest corner of Avenue of the cities and 44th Street. Mister Dreyer. Mister Matthias. Sorry. Mister Mathias? Yes. Yes. Can everybody hear me okay? Yep. Great. So these two items, 8.5 and 8.6, they are tied together. The rezoning has been requested by a prospective property owner here for this property on avenue, the cities. It's actually 23. Oh, 740 4th street is the address that will. That would be rezoned, but that prospective buyer discovered that the southernmost parcel for them was actually zoned to or a single family residential. So when they inquired with our staff and found that out, they're requesting a rezoning back to the original was previously zoned commercial back in 2006. So it did change with the last zoning code. I think there was probably some wishful thinking that maybe it would go to residential at the time, but it's continued to be used as commercial all along. And then the final note I would have on this, the comp plan shows it as residential, right? That was the reason that it was zoned at residential back in. In 2006. So to approve this rezoning, we do, staff does recommend, also amend the comp plan. And that's why you see those two items on the agenda there. So this went to our plan commission. Their recommendation was to approve nine vote of nine to zero. And that's also the staff recommendation. Thank you. Thank you very much. Motion to approve. Second motion by Finch, seconded by Castro. Discussion hearing, none. Roll call, please. Alderperson? Timian? Aye. Finch, aye. McNeil, aye. Castro? Schmidt, aye. Murphy, aye. Masias? Aye. Rezaq, aye. All right, moving to 8.6. An ordinance amending chapter 35, zoning and land development of the moline Code of ordinances by enacting an amendment to the zoning map incorporated therein as section 35 3103, map of standard zoning districts, parentheses. 23 oh, 740 4th Street. Mister Matthias, anything else to add? Nothing further, your honor. Thank you. Motion by Finch, 2nd 2nd onto my right here with Razak. Discussion. Mister Timian wanted to extend appreciation. Amending the comprehensive plan is a very normal thing when situations like this come up, and we didn't have staff for such a long time that it felt like out of place action. So I'm glad to see that we're back in the place where we can do this kind of regular city function for situations like this. Thank you. Anything further? Hearing, none. Roll call, please. Alderperson? Timian? Aye. Finch, aye. McNeil? Aye. Castro, aye. Schmidt, aye. Murphy? Aye. Macias? Aye. Rezaq, aye. That motion passes. Item 8.7, a resolution amending the annual meeting schedule for 2024 to reflect the new meeting time of the keep moline. Beautiful commission to be held at 04:00 p.m. on the second Thursday of each month, effective June, June 2024, and authorizing city staff to do all things necessary to notify the media of the amended 2024 annual meeting schedule. Mister Butas sure this is very straightforward request moving their meeting until 04:00 p.m. rather than 430. And it is required that since the calendar is adopted annually by council for all boards and commissions and the council, that any amendment would be brought forward. Motion to approve second motion by Finch, seconded by Castro. Discussion. I will just say, just to make a note, that. That 430 time was really helpful in the previous council because the representation needed from the council, we were able to spread it out, because someone who worked regularly until 04:00 p.m. was able to get there by 430. So just something to keep in mind for staff when it comes to scheduling things is that when you need representation, it's helpful when people can actually be there. Okay. Thank you. So noted. Uh huh. Okay. Roll call, please. If there's no further discussion. Roll call, please. Other person. Timian, aye. Finch, aye. McNeil, aye. Castro, aye. Schmidt, aye. Murphy, aye. Masias, aye. Razak, aye.

Is that Mister Matthias? Chris? Yes. This is a simple sign face change, which normally would not require any kind of permit in our code. They're just changing out the face. We have a new business going in. But shout out to Irene Muno, Irene Munoz, and my staff, who discovered that we did not have a licensing agreement for this sign. And if it's overhanging right away, which this is, it's overhanging the sidewalk, we have to have a licensing agreement so we can have the insurance in place in case there was some kind of accident or something. So this is really just taking care of something that, you know, a licensing agreement that I think wasn't since 1996 we didn't have on file. So we have just asked staff, just asking for you to approve this. Thanks. Motion to approve second motion by Finch, seconded by Razak. Discussion. I think we all say thank you for catching that.

Is that mister? That would be Mister Lode. Mister Lode. Thank you. GTP partners owns or operates a monopole up on the 42nd street water tank site. They're requesting and staff is recommending a approval of an amendment to the land lease agreement there that extends the lease 15 years. The provisions that the city would gain is a 4% escalation in rent revenue as well as 15,000 cash upfront. Thank you. Is there a motion? Motion to approve, motion by Finch, second seconded by Razak. Discussion hearing? None. Roll call, please. Alderperson? Timian? Aye. Finch, aye. McNeil, aye. Castro, aye. Schmidt, aye. Murphy, aye. Macias, aye. Reza, aye. All right, the motion passes. Item 8.10, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a parking lease agreement with monarch Investment and Management group to lease 36 parking spaces at the rate of dollar 35 per space located in lot r to provide parking for the LeClaire apartments located at 421 19th Street, Moline, Illinois, and approving the waiver of the parking lease fees from April 20 through March 2023. Mister Vitas. Yes, I'm happy to report that we are finally at the stage where this is the last of many, many parking lot leases that have been outstanding for many, many years. This culminates with the approval of this parking lease would culminate, bringing all of them up to date and in force, which is a gap required, which is actually a GASB requirement that went into effect last year. So by not doing this and not keeping them up to date, then it has to be reported in your audit that we're failing to maintain our leases properly. So we extend, extended this lease. This is the identical lease that was prepared and provided to Bush construction as a part of the JC Penney redevelopment RDA. So this is identical to that. This parking lot is actually located just to the east of the renew property, the parking lot that they own along in between Fourth Avenue A and Fourth Avenue. And we're recommending a approval at this rate. I can tell you, though, that monarch, of course, was surprised by the amount. Their lease goes back to almost 2006 or 2008 has not been negotiated since. Their rate was $8 per space. It was never updated. And going back to 2010 was the last time this was touched. So I've advised them that we're bringing this forward for approval this evening. And I don't see any other choice if we're going to bring these leases in line and to treat all of the respective businesses fairly throughout the downtown. Thank you. Motion to approve. Second motion by finch, second by Macias. Discussion, mister Timian. Thank you, your honor. Chief Vitas. Chief. Thank you. What was the methodology for determining the price? I'm sorry? The methodology for determining the adequate price to charge for the parking lot spaces. How did we do that? Correct. We did that. Basically, we started actually going back to our leases. If you'll remember, back in 2021, when you first came out of the council, we were in the midst of negotiating with the us government. Government GSA, specifically for the post office, who was, by the way, the only organization that paid their lease throughout the entire pandemic. Only once. They never stopped paying.

I'm sorry? The methodology for determining the adequate price to charge for the parking lot spaces. How did we do that? Correct. We did that. Basically, we started actually going back to our leases. If you'll remember, back in 2021, when you first came out of the council, we were in the midst of negotiating with the us government. Government GSA, specifically for the post office, who was, by the way, the only organization that paid their lease throughout the entire pandemic. Only once. They never stopped paying.

Yes, Madam Mayor, members of council, this represents the final parcel that I'm aware of as of today, that idot is relinquishing as a remnant parcel along the corridor. This is the property that was first offered to the deer and company, and they have chosen not to acquire this property. It's the property directly across from the off ramp leaving Iowa and entering Illinois at River Drive, as well as two smaller remnant parcels that would adjoin existing property that we own along 6th Avenue.

We move to our informationals 9.1 lead service line replacement. Mister Lode, good evening again, your honor. Council. During the April roundtable discussion, we discussed staff's recommendations and planning relating to lead service line replacements, which are required as part of the Illinois led Service Service line Replacement Notification act and potential future federal regulations that are coming forward. During those discussions, we describe the service line that is broken into two pieces. One piece that typically lies out in the street that the city owns and maintains, and then the other piece that typically lies on the private property that the property owner maintains. During those discussions, staff recommended that for efficiency and effectiveness of executing our plan, that we transfer the responsibility of the replacement of the private side over to the city for the purposes of compliance with the regulation. This informational is the introduction of proposed language in the code in sections 34 2102 and 34 20 114 to effect that transfer from the property owner over to the city. The staff is recommending this because it's going to make it much easier for us to coordinate the installation of the entire line which is required by the regulation. Another requirement of that lead service line replacement Notification act is the actual letters that some of you received this week. And I want to assure you that we've had many calls come in. I know that a lot of you have received those calls as well know that 99% of the language in the letter is required by the FDA. Thank you very much, Mister Lodi. Questions from the council. Thank you for having all of the information for us and previous, you know, discussions about it. Oh, I'm so sorry, Mister Schmidt. Yeah, Tony. I'm reading this correctly that we're also recommending that the city is taking the cost of that full replacement, right? Yes. The responsibility for the financial. The financial and the responsibility for the replacement. Yes. And I just, I'm not remembering from April, did we have an estimate of what that cost was or what we think it might be? I understand it might be in a range. There's a lot of flex to that. No, it did. What we, what we talked to you about in April was a proposed cost per service line for the full service line of $10,000 per service. That's a cost that we have seen up in the Chicagoland area. We expect that cost to be slightly lower here in the western Illinois area. And just to refresh our memories, there were also routes for paying for that, for us getting that money that we have discussed previously. Yep. And the staff intends to bring a surcharge proposal to you as part of the September Enterprise fund financial discussions. Okay, thank you for the reminder on the number. Go ahead, Mister Schmidt.

Thanks for that reminder on the numbers. Just trying to keep them straight in my head. I do think that it's something that, as we know, a lot of homes and a lot of families in the city going to be dealing with. I prefer to approach it as we are from that group opportunity where we're going to take on that cost, which is then sharing the burden across everyone, essentially, as opposed to sharing it across only those homes that are affected, or I think it's a community problem and we're addressing it in a community way. And I do appreciate that. But also just being mindful that it's one of those big projects that we have to make sure we're taken care of. So thank you, Mister Timian. I know that this project is lead service line. If we run into a house that has lead internal lines while doing this replacement, because obviously they're going to be in the house to hook it up. Is there a course of action to take there? Because I'm sure that some of our older homes, we can't pay for it, but I mean, is this an opportunity to document it? All of the regulations relating to this water system regulations are silent with regard to the plumbing inside the house. Can you please refresh my memory, though, also about grant or other opportunities there are for us to finance this? Yes. So we believe that we're going to receive some congressional funds through Congressman Eric Sorenson in the amount of $500,000 to replace lead service lines in the 15th street corridor. Yet this year, in addition to that, the staff has submitted a project plan to Illinois EPA for the replacement in two census tracts. We've strategically selected census tracts that score the best in the EPA's scoring matrix. Optimistically, we're hoping that within the next month we'll get news that we'll get principal forgiveness for a portion of those. Thank you. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure we all were reminded that it's a variety of ways we're paying for this, not just a surgeon. Yes. So one more point of consideration for you. Obviously we're not asking for any action tonight, but something for you to think about. And that is that there have been a number of service lines on the private side that have been replaced since this let service line replacement Notification act went into place in January of 2022. And so at some point, staff is going to be coming forward with a recommendation. Recommendation to reimburse for some sort of reimbursement for those property owners that had to incur those costs themselves. Thank you very much. Any further questions from the council? All right, thank you, Mister Loney. Chief, discussion regarding fireworks and section eleven 1104 of the Code of ordinances. Well, the good news is we found a better looking replacement for the fire chief. Fire Marshal Mitch Cunningham will join me in this presentation. So happy Memorial Day. It's coming around the corner. And of course that means the next holiday is the 4 July. Those of you who have served for a little while know that that is a popular, yet unpopular holiday. So I wanted to have a brief discussion with you about the fireworks complaints that you undoubtedly receive, and just have a little bit of a preparatory discussion on what can and most likely can't be done to address this. I think we need to acknowledge that this isn't a moline issue, that this is in every community. Fireworks on the 4 July and roughly about a week time period. And there's two categories of people, people that love fireworks and people that hate fireworks. You are going to hear from the people that hate fireworks, undoubtedly. And we understand that the fireworks, I guess we'll call it epidemic, really kind of exploded. And I know Mitch probably can comment on it. Two reasons, particularly around here. One is the pandemic when, if you remember in 2020, it happened in the spring, obviously, and they canceled all the city sponsored fireworks and everyone did their own along the same time. Somewhere along the line, the Iowa legalized fireworks, which made it closer than driving to Wisconsin or Missouri to obtain fireworks. And I think Mitchen commented about the laws both in Illinois and Iowa that really make fireworks supply extremely easy and prevalent in our community. The number of fireworks complaints the Millennium Police Department got in the week of July 1 to July 7, which is the holiday as it moves, either hits a weekend or this year it's in the middle of the week. So we're going to have kind of two weekends, not apples to apples comparison, but in 2019 to 2020, the complaints went up 33%. We have returned back to pre pandemic calls for service about that. We're exactly at the same number. So it has kind of leveled back off to what I would call the bad normal, if you will. The other problem is if you look at a pin map of the locations, it's citywide, but as expected, obviously highly concentrated in our residential neighborhoods. I'm just going to be honest with you.

We cannot throw enough manpower, the police department, department or even the fire department to address this issue. We just can't do it. There's just not enough people because we still have very active bars, we still have active alcohol consumption in the holiday season, and the calls for service, and we're getting every time. This is a very popular holiday, as you know. And so it draws our resources to priority calls. And while I understand that the fireworks complaints are very, very serious to people that are being affected by them, they are in kind of a nuisance category, as opposed to if there's a fire or a fight shooting or something like that, that takes precedence. Second is it would be untenable for the cost to throw unwieldy amounts of overtime and stuff at it. I just think it would be futile to address these with just continuous continued manpower. So, you know, I wanted to have some conversation about this, and I'll give Mitch a minute to comment about some research he's done about options. But one of them is to consider raising the fine as deterrence as you all are drivers, some cyclists more than others. But the speed limit, we don't catch every speeder, but it is a deterrent. And we can talk about changing the fines. But I also want to, to have an honest conversation about the impact of fines, and some of you may or may be keenly aware of is that fines sometimes are not very popular. And in all reality, fines just disproportionately impact certain neighborhoods, certain people of wealth, certain communities of color. And I can tell you that there is a large section of fireworks complaints in some of our lower income or communities of color that I think, I think looking at it probably would potentially disproportionately be affected. So there are a lot of things to consider here, and that's why we're here, to just have a discussion with you, and I'll let Mitch talk a little bit about some of the research. Thank you, your honor. A couple weeks ago here in Moline, Moline Fire department hosted Illinois state fire marshals office in the IDNR. We had a pyrotechnics workshop, if you will, had over 20 departments in attendance. We were able to network with those individuals, find out what other strategies other communities throughout the state are using, and what we heard was pretty discouraging. There's real no enforcement mechanism in the state of Illinois stands or businesses are allowed to sell them to consumers. It's not regulated. They're supposed to have the proper permitting, proper paperwork, but they just don't. So our strategy this year, and state fire marshals office said we were on track, is to increase our social media awareness. We discussed confiscation or raising the fines. I know Chief Gaul has his opinions on confiscations, and we agree with those as well, how that could be problematic. So our standpoint would be stricter fines would probably be the best solution. Increase social media awareness. But that does take some time. It wouldn't be something that we would see immediate effects from. It would take some definite time. In 2023, the Mullein Fire department had seven related firework calls in five days. One of those was a garage fire from pyrotechnics. Unfortunately, they are legal to sell in the state of Illinois. You can go to a community southwest of here, walking distance from city hall here, across the river, and purchase fireworks. So it's a very, very problematic issue that we're looking for answers for. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Just since the fire marshal brought up confiscation, certainly that's a technique that's available to us. My concern is turning a mountain into making a mountain out of a molehill. My fear in these situations is people have a lot of money invested in these, and we end up having a use of force. Scandal over fireworks, that my officers are using force to effect an arrest, a lawful arrest, and it goes awry over fireworks. And my personal opinion of it is, I don't know that that's the best use of our resources and the best use of our use of force, which is very low. It's less than one half of 1%. And all of our calls are safe. 63,000 calls. It just concerns me. I'm not saying we can't do it. We won't do it in the right situation, when you're going to a drunk party in the middle of the evening around a holiday celebration, and we get into this argument with someone, and we're saying, we're taking this stuff, we're entering your property and taking this stuff, and we're taking you. And now we've got family members that are upset. That's a great way to end up on the national news. So that gives me pause. But again, all these options are certainly on the table. So we're looking for some advice or how you want to handle this, or if you're okay with the way we've been doing things, we can do all those things. I do want to draw your attention to section eleven, 1104, which the fine for fireworks is $50. If you pay it within seven days, it's 25.

Thoughts from the council, please. Yes, Miss Castro. So last year, do you know about how many residents you find for fireworks just because you didn't? We try to gain cooperation, and I know fire Marshall also, you know, the cooperation to get me. Some communities say, listen, we're going to tolerate it for these three, four days. Done at 10:00, done at midnight, please. You know, and they gain cooperation through that way. And that's what my officers are going like, stop. Don't do it. The other problem is chasing this stuff's in the air. So I'm sure you get it. Even as alderman, you're going to get someone's lighting off fireworks in my neighborhood. And we get a call from an address, and they really don't know where it's coming from. So now you can imagine getting somewhere up as 50 calls, you know, 30 to 50 calls. The officers that are assigned to fireworks details, basically, those calls are stacked. So now they're driving from here to here to here. They get there, it's not going off. I mean, fireworks displays last, what, home, 110 minutes max? I mean, my officers can't even get there in ten minutes. So now it's gone. Or, you know, they don't know where it's coming from. They're driving around the neighborhood. It's difficult to call investigation. So there's a lot of issues with that. So to answer your question directly, is our number one tactic is try to gain compliance. So really raising a fine wouldn't really do me. You know, I mean, I think one of the concerns that I know the parks department has is some issues in the parks. I think that some of these issues that we would have on streets, parks, public right of way, we would take a zero tolerance approach and say, you're getting a ticket, but we would need to do a public education. It would hopefully be a deterrent. People say, I don't know if I want to light off, too. Hundred dollars worth of fireworks for $750 fine. It's the same thing as a speeding ticket. It's $166 for a speeding ticket. Just drive the speed limit. We can't catch every speed. But again, if you look at the map, a lot of them are in areas that I think you're going to hear complaints about that I can tell you. I got a complaint yesterday, a very angry individual, former colleague, that you might all know, and he was involved, his family was involved in a traffic crash and absolutely was upset that the at fault driver, which was a family member, got a ticket in a traffic crash. I mean, citations are not popular, and you're going to get just as many complaints of those as you are these. So, I mean, it's a lot to weigh, Miss Murtree. I think the issue for the people who have complained to me or since I've been in this city of Moline has been the loud ones, the ones that scare the vets, that scare the dogs, the cats, you know, they cause anxiety. Is there some way, you know, the sparklers aren't the problem. The ones that, you know, they light and go up in the sky. I can't think of what they're called. But the very loud ones that are. That's the ones. So there's a couple different types of fireworks. Novelty are permitted in the city of Moline currently. And that's your sparklers, your snaps, your smoke bombs, stuff like that. The stands in town, that's what they're allowed to sell. So the bureau is going to step up inspection, compliance inspections on those stands that we have throughout the city that are permitted. We do do follow up. Unfortunately, we've had caught vendors that sell in Iowa. They have the stuff in the trailer. We asked them to remove it, take it out of there, or else they won't get a permit the following year. Unfortunately, beyond that, everything goes to a 1.4 GE firework which is considered consumer. And that's the things that will pop or have a report. That's your bottle rockets, roaming candles, stuff like that. Those are not legal, but unfortunately vendors can sell them in Illinois. So it's kind of a. I think there's over 140, 40 some stands throughout the state and mainly they follow the interstate corridors. But of course, our neighbors across the river can sell pretty much anything over there as well. So that's a little bit more convenient. Did you have your hand misfits? Is there an increase in accidents compared to previous years? I'm not aware of that. I don't know if you have any stats in previous years, but I mean, it's usually just one or two a year. I don't think I've seen any significant increase. Mister timmy and then mister macias. Thank you, your honor.

I don't think I've seen any significant increase. Mister timmy and then mister macias. Thank you, your honor. Oh, I see you mister schmidt as well. I'm under the impression that fines only work as a deterrent if people think it's realistic that they're going to get caught, and no one does. No one thinks that they're going to get caught. And so I don't think that this is an appropriate deterrent. I fear that if we increase it, it will be weaponized against certain communities. And that's also not really something I'm on board with. I think a nominal fine is a deterrent or is a punishment. As much as $50 is still dollar 50 and that's annoying if you get sided with it. I think that that could teach a lesson without ruining a family's year. Mister macias. Thank you, your honor. Are other neighboring cities looking at increasing fines or how are they approaching? Good question. I'm not aware of any. We haven't really had that discussions amongst chiefs. But I can tell you that everybody deals with the same problem. And my. The reason I ask is, you know, if we go up to $750. Well, I'm gonna go to my friend's house in East Moline or Rock island. Yeah, good for recommend it. Yeah, it's still. It's in our community and you can still hear the fireworks. Yeah, I understand. And that's the other problem is to your point, Alderman Murphy, people hear these loud ones, but the loud ones go up higher and they're so hard to find. You know, like it's just. It's like chasing a laser light show, you know? Where is it coming from, Mister Schmidt? Yeah. You know that difficulty that Olga prince has brought up about the fines? I literally witnessed the neighbors pick up and move to someone else's house. So that if the cops got sent back out, they wouldn't be hit for being at the same location. If they're fine, I mean, they're, they're gonna bounce it around in a million different ways. I think no matter what we do, I think my inclination would be to focus on if there are opportunities we have to curb the behavior. Like super late nights. Right. Or just something that is going to make that difference. I don't think we can run into making a big fine push. It's going to help in that way. But I do wonder if following up on uncertainty, things might help. The other question I had is if someone is essentially gets the police and they're called out and they come, would we issue a citation if we have to return a second time? Would that be playing out there? Or has that not been a major issue generally the last few years? That's a good question. I guess. I did not bring repetitive complaint calls. My general guess is, and is just from my own experience, is typically because they go off, typically we're not being called back out to the same location, at least in the same night. Right now they may have another supply that goes on for days or what you'll have happen is house a has them tonight, house b has them tomorrow. House. And that's all, all kind of, you know, in your all living neighborhoods, you know how people are friends and there's some people that have traditions and their traditions have grown in class of fireworks as well as, you know, larger parties over more days. I know that the fire marshal also did say that the cost of fireworks has also gone, gone up 75%. So maybe that will be a deterrent in itself. But yeah, I mean, there's just no great answer. There's all good questions. I don't have your repetitive question. I think it's an option. But from my experience, it's typically not the call that we're, that's not the problem. I would like to add. Oh, I'm so sorry, Mister McKeown, you go ahead first. So I'm not in the camp that hates fireworks, but I might be in the camp that strongly dislikes how many? And so just thinking about this year and I don't know, there's no way to quantify, but it seems like they increase every year. So this is something that we could be looking at that only gets larger. You mean that. Actually, no, the complaints have returned. So they got really bad in 2021 and we're back. Have we back down to the same level of complaints for the week that we had pre pandemic. So I think what you are finding is that people have different types of fireworks that are louder, that are rattling the window or something like that. They spend a little bit more money. It's markup money or whatever they were calling it that you got. They're like, oh, let's throw it into the fireworks and blow off the water. Larger shell. I mean, we also have to be honest that our neighboring states are not. Iowa legalized fireworks two, three years ago, maybe four years ago, you readily look it up. I mean, you can get major stuff over there. So that's a large problem. That's why I think why you feel that way is because the content of the display, home displays changed. So I'm also interested. You mentioned social media. What is our messaging been around in the past, or what would it look like this year? Is it around the fines or is it around safety? Is it risk? That's a good question.

We kind of do a mixed bag. We've got good response showing the injuries that are caused from fireworks. So we're a paramedic service. We do see some of this stuff, unfortunately. So we do have some x ray photos and those type of things that get a reaction to maybe make people think twice. But like Chief Gulf just mentioned, as far as fireworks and, you know, fireworks that are loud or getting louder, the fireworks that we have for lighting of the commons, for example, those are considered a consumer grade firework, believe it or not. Yeah. So that's what we're up against. And unfortunately, it is the stuff that's like 1.33 g, which is heavily regulated by the ATF and IDNR and stuff. That stuff is out there, too, and that becomes an officer safety issue. And if we discover those type of things, we literally bring in the bomb squad. There's been firefighters that have gone to calls in someone's garage. They were going to take the fireworks, they put it in the fire truck, and they take it back to the firehouse, and it can be catastrophic. So our members are trained not to touch the stuff. And I will send some education stuff out to Chief Gault as well. So his officers are trained to identify. It's very distinctive wrappers. They don't have the bright, fancy wrappers like the 1.3 g stuff does, and that stuff is heavily regulated. But occasionally, you know, someone's working a show with someone else, they put one in their pocket, or whatever happens, happens. One didn't go off, they take it home. And that stuff is out there in the communities. Thank you for all of that information, I think you're huge hearing. Do you have a consensus from this group that status quo? Kind of status quo, but I think I would like to emphasize this point about the social media presence or any kind of media outreach that you plan. One thing we haven't discussed is simply encouraging more neighborliness, which we need in so many parts of our community in the first place. Do you have vets? Are there people who are actually impacted by PTSD, et cetera, who are willing to speak about why, you know, any kind of consideration during the holiday? Like, I don't know how you put that together with professionals or anybody that we have doing community outreach and engagement, but I feel like that might be a path we haven't explored yet. The people with pets, these are people who write regularly on Facebook every year about why they're so disappointed in their neighbors, and if there's some smart plan we can come up with related to increasing that consideration, that'd be great. Mister Schmidt? Yeah, I actually wanted to kind of speak on that same issue. I think that we had seen a good response to a lot of how it was approached last year in those conversations about being able and keeping in mind the pets and children and those. I mean, I myself often have. One of my children has to go out to his grandparents in the middle of nowhere because they impact him. So it's something that kind of hits that home. But I do think that just that sort of message about like, hey, like, keep it reasonable, you know, I understand it's hard for us to also step up because it's illegal. We're supposed to say they don't do it at all. But I also think we know that that's not going to work as well. So I think when we can walk that line, I think it's going to work better. And when I've seen it happening around the community and neighborhoods, people who use the fireworks, they seem to be far more receptive to that message than, you know, don't do it. Forget you. Hey, maybe get it over with by ten or 1030. That message lands a little better, I think. Thank you. One other thing is, I know we put it out on our social media, but we might boost those posts if we haven't been as well, making sure that it's getting to people. Not just people who regularly follow the city information, but to people all over the community. Mister Timian, I would argue that Facebook might not be the best social media outlet for reaching a target audience like this. Gee, who has a TikTok, our podcast. Yeah.

I guess I take it for granted how people are in different buildings, they don't see each other. So everybody took it upon themselves to just kind of update each other on what they were doing and what's going on in their area. So in spite of it not being as popular as your board meeting or even elder woman Castro, still, we had a good discussion there amongst the staff, so. But thank you again to all the staff that went, and we've made the most of it. Thank you so much. Yes, mister. Thanks, your honor. Mister Timmy. Thank you. Your honor. I alluded to this.

Yes, mister. Thanks, your honor. Mister Timmy. Thank you. Your honor. I alluded to this. I'm a heavy consumer podcast, and I encourage you all to check out the new mulling police department's podcast if you didn't know it exists. And we have a host in the corner over here. So I commend them for any attempt, a non conventional attempt for outreach, both for recruitment and for community oriented policing, which breaks out a lot of those barriers between residents and those who have sworn an oath to protect and serve. So I just want to commend them and thank them and ask you all to subscribe. Thank you, mister mcNeil. Just like to acknowledge the residents that you send to moline the past two weekends had a cleanup and then the tree planting that was planned by the Moline development Corporation. So very neighborly group down there, very engaged, excited about progress at Easton park. And a big shout out to park's maintenance staff for two back to back Saturdays with residents. Castro? Nothing. Mister Schmidt. Evan. Your honor. Yeah, just very briefly, I just following up on alderman McNeil's comment. Yeah, MCDC's program was quite successful. 100 trees got planted in literally two days. It's the fastest, according to Eric, the fastest that we've planted that many trees ever. There's still at least 30 more to go that are available that I'm aware of. Great cooperation from staff. I want to do a shout out to the whole staff for. We had about 25% of our full time workforce out, actually, during the cleanup days, working all across the city, which was really, really great, which that's probably about one half of. About 50% of our non public safety personnel were out actually working. Eric has received compliments about the park at the east Enderson woman who lives there past 53 years and says it's the best it's ever looked. So, you know, I wish Pat was here for that because he would have really enjoyed that. Speaking of Pat, I am going to be going to the park board meeting on Thursday afternoon over at public works. And on the agenda is a recommendation to rename East End Park O'Brien park. So I'm sure that will be well received, and I'll bring that news back for final and formal approval by the city council. So. And there's all kind of things going on, but we'll just stop there for now. Thank you. Any other staff updates? All right, hearing none, we'll move to public comment. Chief. And so we need executive session. Your honor, I make a motion that the council convene an executive session for the purpose of discussion of property acquisitions. Five ilCs, 122 c, five. Pending probable or imminent litigation, five ilCs, 122 c, eleven. Is there a second? 2nd motion by Murphy, seconded by Timian. Roll call, please. Holder person. Timian. Finch. Aye. McNeil, aye. Castro, aye. Schmidt, aye. Murphy, aye. Masias aye. Razak. Aye. All right, we move to closed session.
